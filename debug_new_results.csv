In this study, we utilized the enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) as an exogenous reporter to investigate the intergenic regions of the PIV5-JS17 strain for expressing exogenous proteins. These regions included N-P, P-M, M-F, F-SH, SH-HN, and HN-L. Our findings revealed that exogenous gene expression varied at different positions, with the expression cassette containing the non-coding sequence within the P-M intergenic region achieving the highest eGFP fluorescence intensity. Then, we successfully established a porcine infection model through oral administration of the recombinant virus, identified the target organs infected, and verified the safety of the viral vector in swine. Furthermore, using porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV)-S protein as a model antigen, it was demonstrated that the recombinant virus triggered a robust humoral and cellular immune responses. In conclusion, we have developed a novel oral gene delivery system for swine, providing insights and guidance for the design of vector vaccines based on the newly discovered porcine PIV5, the selection of appropriate exogenous gene insertion sites, and vaccine delivery strategies.IMPORTANCEThe research presented in this paper hinges on the fortunate isolation of the PIV5-JS17 strain from the intestines of pigs.

Here, we present a streamlined protocol for labeling hTSCs with the green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter gene via CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knock-in of the gene into the adeno-associated virus site 1 (AAVS1) safe harbor locus.

In this study, we go beyond feasibility assessments and present a comparative framework for evaluating wastewater-based genomic surveillance at airports. From January to April 2023, wastewater samples were collected at Frankfurt and Berlin airports from single aircraft, lavatory trucks, a sewer combining aircraft and airfield wastewater, and an airport terminal. Viral RNA was concentrated and extracted, followed by short-read amplicon sequencing, digital PCR quantification, and variant annotation with SnpEff. Sequencing success and genome coverage varied by sample type. Aircraft wastewater showed variable coverage (median 20.2-52.1%) due to low SARS-CoV-2 concentrations, while coverage from airport terminal wastewater was consistently high (median: 99.3%). Terminal wastewater exhibited the highest mutation diversity, with 143-286 mutations per sample (grab vs composite). Notably, >95% of clinically known mutations were detected in the wastewater at least one week before clinical reporting, and over 9350 previously unreported mutations were identified-highlighting the early-warning potential of airport wastewater surveillance. These results demonstrate that differences in wastewater matrix and sampling location strongly influence genomic information yield. Wastewater surveillance can complement clinical surveillance and should be considered as part of broader global health monitoring. The framework established here offers replicable guidance for other transportation hubs and public health authorities seeking to strengthen early detection capabilities and pandemic preparedness.","Wastewater surveillance at airports has gained interest as a tool for early pathogen detection, but current evidence remains largely feasibility-focused and provides limited guidance on where sampling efforts should be prioritised.

Here, we combine viral vector-mediated expression of DAAO and HyPer7, a genetically encoded fluorescent biosensor for H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, in hippocampal neurons with real-time in vivo fiber photometry to examine chemogenetic production of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> upon delivery of D-norvaline via intraperitoneal injections or drinking water. Observed changes in the HyPer7 ratiometric signal in response to D-norvaline delivery through both routes confirmed controlled generation of intraneuronal H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>in vivo. Raman microspectroscopy revealed a decrease of electron transport chain loading with electrons upon in vivo chemogenetic generation of intraneuronal H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. In sum, our findings enable us to suggest that the DAAO-based chemogenetic tool combined with delivery of D-norvaline via either intraperitoneal injections or drinking water is suitable for induction of chronic oxidative stress in the brain in vivo."

The diversity arises from the presence of different catalytic β subunits incorporated into the 20S core particle. Constitutive proteasomes contain β1, β2 and β5 subunits, whereas immunoproteasomes integrate β1i, β2i and β5i proteins. Intermediate proteasomes comprise combinations of constitutive and immune subunits, but typically lack the β2i subunit. Distinct proteasome configurations have widespread impact on cellular metabolism, gene expression, immune signaling, stress adaptation and tumorigenesis. However, the biological functions of proteasome subtypes remain incompletely defined, underscoring the need for refined experimental systems to uncover their specific activities. Previously, we generated cancer cell lines expressing mCherry-tagged β5i subunit under the control of endogenous regulatory elements.

Efficient integration of fluorescent protein-encoding sequences into target genomes provided robust expression and integration of chimeric subunits into proteasomes. In TZM-blB8-mCherryB10-CFP cells, photo-conversion of PS-CFP2 allowed visualization of both intermediate and immunoproteasomes within the cellular nuclei following treatment with IFN-γ/TNF. In SW620B8-mCherryB5-GFP cells, analysis of intracellular proteasome localization revealed discrete regions enriched in β5i-containing proteasomes. Moreover, IFN-γ/TNF exposure induced a fluorescence shift from green to red, accompanied by redistribution of intracellular proteasomes in SW620B8-mCherryB5-GFP cells. Multiphoton microscopy of tumors grafted into immunocompromised mice showed the formation of β5i-containing, proteasome-enriched inclusions and suggested their potential release from cancer cells. Collectively, the TZM-blB8-mCherryB10-CFP cell line provides a tool to interrogate immunoproteasome functions independently of intermediate proteasomes, whereas SW620B8-mCherryB5-GFP cells enable visual discrimination between constitutive and β5i-containing proteasomes both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. Generated cell lines provide a novel platform for dissecting proteasome functions, addressing the distinct properties of individual proteasome forms, and assessing the impact of diverse compounds on the proteasome repertoire in cultured cells and in tumor xenografts.","Most intracellular proteins undergo degradation by proteasomes, which exist in constitutive, immune, and intermediate forms. The diversity arises from the presence of different catalytic β subunits incorporated into the 20S core particle. Constitutive proteasomes contain β1, β2 and β5 subunits, whereas immunoproteasomes integrate β1i, β2i and β5i proteins. Intermediate proteasomes comprise combinations of constitutive and immune subunits, but typically lack the β2i subunit. Distinct proteasome configurations have widespread impact on cellular metabolism, gene expression, immune signaling, stress adaptation and tumorigenesis. However, the biological functions of proteasome subtypes remain incompletely defined, underscoring the need for refined experimental systems to uncover their specific activities. Previously, we generated cancer cell lines expressing mCherry-tagged β5i subunit under the control of endogenous regulatory elements. Using CRISPR/Cas9 nickase technology, we further modified the genomes of the colon adenocarcinoma SW620B8-mCherry and cervical adenocarcinoma TZM-blB8-mCherry cells. In SW620B8-mCherryB5-GFP cells, the <i>eGFP</i> gene was inserted at the 3' end of the <i>PSMB5</i> gene, which encodes the β5 subunit.

The mechanisms underlying changes in PARP trapping, a central aspect of PARPi efficacy, are not well understood, as current experimental methodologies lack resolution and throughput. To address this, we develop an intramolecular fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based biosensor by CRISPR-Cas9 dual labeling of endogenous PARP1 with EGFP and mCherryFP in OVCAR4 cells. This biosensor enables real-time, single-cell analysis of PARP trapping dynamics. Using fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM), we reveal dose-dependent PARP trapping, differentiate the trapping efficiencies of four clinically approved PARPi, and observe reduced trapping in PARPi-resistant models in vitro and in vivo. This biosensor provides critical insights into PARPi resistance mechanisms, with implications for developing more effective therapies and advancing personalized treatment for ovarian cancer patients.","Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPi) have revolutionized the treatment of ovarian high-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC), particularly in homologous recombination-deficient tumors.

To investigate regulatory mechanisms in <i>Aqp2</i> gene transcription, we engineered an <i>Aqp2</i> reporter cell line using CRISPR/Cas9 to insert a green fluorescent protein (GFP) cassette at the endogenous <i>Aqp2</i> gene locus in mpkCCD cells. In the absence of dDAVP, a vasopressin analog, these cells exhibited low or undetectable GFP and Aqp2 expression in all cells. dDAVP stimulation (1nM dDAVP for 48hrs) markedly increased both GFP and Aqp2 expression together with reversal upon dDAVP removal.

Interestingly, fewer than 50% of cells express GFP and Aqp2 after dDAVP or forskolin, indicating significant variability even though they were clonally-derived. We flow-sorted the GFP<sup>-</sup> cells (Aqp2<sup>-</sup>) and GFP<sup>+</sup> cells (Aqp2<sup>+</sup>), regrew them, and restimulated them separately with dDAVP. Cells originating from GFP<sup>-</sup> cells gave rise to both GFP<sup>-</sup> cells and GFP<sup>+</sup> cells, and GFP<sup>+</sup> cells similarly regenerated both GFP<sup>-</sup> and GFP<sup>+</sup> populations in the same proportion.

We used single fluorescent protein biosensors for in situ NAD+ measurements in J1 mouse embryonic stem cells. Sensors and controls were localized to the nucleus, cytoplasm, and mitochondrial compartments. Using a specific inhibitor for nicotinamide salvage, we found that loss of this pathway depleted NAD+ concentrations in all three subcellular compartments in undifferentiated culture conditions. We determined that loss of nicotinamide salvage reduced colony size, extended cell cycle, and resulted in diminished expression of self-renewal markers. Supplementation with precursors in the nicotinamide salvage pathway bypassed the pharmacological block, replenished cytosolic NAD+ levels, and reversed the effects on colony size. Notably, supplementation with deaminated precursors did not replenish intracellular NAD+ levels, suggesting minimal contribution from this pathway at this stage. In support, expression data from multiple mouse and human lines showed that nicotinamide salvage pathway enzyme NAMPT was predominantly expressed at the embryonic stem cell stage compared to the enzymes in other NAD+ biosynthesis pathways.

In this study, we generated a recombinant OROV-expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (rOROV/GFP) to facilitate rapid and sensitive antiviral evaluation. Growth kinetics demonstrated that rOROV/GFP replicated less efficiently than wild-type rOROV and that the historical prototype strain (BeAn19991) exhibited higher replication efficiency than the recent epidemic isolate (PE-IAM4637) in both Vero E6 and Huh7 cells. Using this system, we evaluated the antiviral activity of ribavirin, favipiravir (T-705), and remdesivir against OROV. All three compounds inhibited OROV replication in a dose-dependent manner, with remdesivir showing the greatest potency (IC₅₀ values of 0.31 µM). Taken together, our findings highlight remdesivir as a promising candidate for the treatment of Oropouche fever caused by OROV.

Neural activity was recorded using metal-free one-photon fiber photometry with GCaMP calcium indicators. Behavioral effects were assessed through a rotational test in freely moving mice after MK-801-induced hyperlocomotion. Local temperature changes were monitored by optical thermometry. In pristine mode, RF exposure induced temperature rises leading to dose-dependent suppression of cortical parvalbumin (PV) interneuron activity.

Asic3 deletion results in a remarkably enhanced self-renewal, reduced differentiation, and 9-fold greater number of murine acute myeloid LICs. We developed an ultrasensitive, ratiometric, genetically encoded fluorescent pH sensor (pHluorin3) and demonstrated that LICs prefer localizing in the endosteal niche with a neutral pH range of 7.34-7.42, but not in the vascular niche with a lower pH range of 6.89-7.22. Unexpectedly, acid-ASIC3 signaling inhibits both murine and human LIC activities in a noncanonical manner by interacting with the N-terminal of STIM1 to reduce calcium-mediated CAMK1-CREB-MEIS1-LDHA levels, without inducing cation currents. This study reveals a pathway in suppression of leukemogenesis in the acidic BM niche and provides insight into targeting LICs or other cancer stem cells through pH-dependent ASICs."
Trigeminal nerve stimulation modulates dopaminergic circuits and neuroinflammation to alleviate depression.,Trigeminal nerve stimulation modulates dopaminergic circuits and neuroinflammation to alleviate depression.,Brain stimulation,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.brs.2025.103005,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.brs.2025.103005,,"Trigeminal nerve stimulation (TNS) is a promising noninvasive neuromodulation therapy for depression; however, its mechanisms remain unclear. This study investigated antidepressant-like effects of TNS and its underlying mechanisms in post-traumatic brain injury depression (PTD). The antidepressant efficacy of TNS was evaluated in multiple depression models using standardized behavioral assays. Peripheral mechanisms were probed by chemogenetic activation or inhibition of trigeminal ganglion (TG) neuronal subpopulations in Cre-line mice. Centrally, pathway-selective chemogenetic manipulations tested the role of the paraventricular nucleus-ventral tegmental area-nucleus accumbens (PVN-VTA-NAc) circuit, coupled with in vivo (GPCR)-activation-based dopamine (GRAB-DA) fluorescence monitoring to quantify dopamine dynamics. Receptor-specific contributions were assessed using shRNA knockdown of D1/D2 or D3 receptors (D1/D2 or D3) in the NAc. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cytokine profiling was used to evaluate inflammatory modulation. Primary endpoints were analyzed after the 10-day TNS treatment and following a 10-day post-stimulation period. TNS alleviated depressive-like behaviors across models. TG TRPV1<sup>+</sup> neurons are both necessary and sufficient for efficacy. Chemogenetic modulation of the PVN-VTA-NAc pathway reproduced or abolished TNS effects, while GRAB-DA recordings confirmed increased dopamine release during stimulation. In the NAc, D1/D2 knockdown impaired effects of treatment, whereas D3 knockdown eliminated persistence after stimulation. TNS reduced CSF cytokines in controls and D1/D2 knockdown mice, but not in D3 knockdown mice, indicating that early D3-dependent anti-inflammatory effects sustain long-term benefits. TNS alleviates depressive-like behaviors through TG TRPV1<sup>+</sup> neurons and PVN-VTA-NAc circuit activation, with D1/D2 receptors mediating acute effects and D3 receptors maintaining lasting anti-inflammatory benefits.","Trigeminal nerve stimulation (TNS) is a promising noninvasive neuromodulation therapy for depression; however, its mechanisms remain unclear.

GCaMP6f-expressing chromaffin cells in murine adrenal slices exhibit dynamic spontaneous calcium responses that do not require nerve input.,GCaMP6f-expressing chromaffin cells in murine adrenal slices exhibit dynamic spontaneous calcium responses that do not require nerve input.,Cell calcium,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceca.2025.103104,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceca.2025.103104,,"Chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla exhibit spontaneous action potentials and intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses that result in catecholamine secretion when dissociated in vitro. However, spontaneous activity in these cells is nearly abolished when splanchnic nerve input is blocked in vivo. To address this discrepancy, we examined spontaneous Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses in chromaffin cells in an intermediate preparation, adrenal slices from transgenic mice expressing the genetically-encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator GCaMP6f selectively in these cells. Within this preparation, the three-dimensional structure and extracellular environment surrounding chromaffin cells is retained, as is input from distal splanchnic nerve terminals, which spontaneously release the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Chromaffin cells within these slices displayed spontaneous Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses with frequencies and amplitudes that varied greatly within and between individual cells. However, population averages remained stable, providing a tool to measure the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying these responses. While overall average frequencies and amplitudes of spontaneous Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses depended on the influx of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> through voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, they did not require Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from intracellular stores, splanchnic nerve input or activation of voltage-gated sodium channels. Together, these results suggest that spontaneous activity in chromaffin cells in adrenal slices is generated autonomously, similar to that in dissociated chromaffin cells. By contrast, spontaneous activity in chromaffin cells in intact animals likely represents a distinct form that depends on basal input from intact splanchnic nerve. This study provides a foundation to further explore the diverse mechanisms mediating chromaffin cell activation.","Chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla exhibit spontaneous action potentials and intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses that result in catecholamine secretion when dissociated in vitro.
