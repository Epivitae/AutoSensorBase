Insect olfactory receptors (ORs) have been traditionally studied using <i>Drosophila</i> empty neuron systems or with expression and functionalization in HEK293 cells or <i>Xenopus laevis</i> oocytes<i>.</i> Recently, the yeast <i>Saccharomyces cerevisia</i>e (<i>S. cerevisiae</i>) has emerged as a promising chassis for the functional expression of heterologous seven transmembrane receptors. <i>S. cerevisiae</i> provides a platform for the cheap and high throughput study of these receptors and potential deorphanization. In this study, we explore the foundations of a scalable yeast-based platform for the functional expression of insect olfactory receptors by employing a genetically encoded calcium sensor for quantitative evaluation of fluorescence and optimized experimental parameters for enhanced functionality. While the co-receptor of insect olfactory receptors remains non-functional in our yeast-based system, we thoroughly evaluated various experimental variables and identified future research directions for establishing an OR platform in <i>S. cerevisiae</i>.",

        "abstract": "Beyond its role as the \"queen of electrolytes\", chloride can also serve as an allosteric regulator or even a signaling ion. To illuminate this essential anion across such a spectrum of biological processes, researchers have relied on fluorescence imaging with genetically encoded sensors. In large part, these have been derived from the green fluorescent protein found in the jellyfish <i>Aequorea victoria</i>. However, a standalone sensor with a turn-on intensiometric response at physiological pH has yet to be reported. Here, we address this technology gap by building on our discovery of the anion-sensitive fluorescent protein mNeonGreen (mNG). The targeted engineering of two non-coordinating residues, namely K143 and R195, in the chloride binding pocket of mNG coupled with an anion walking screening and selection strategy resulted in the ChlorON sensors: ChlorON-1 (K143W/R195L), ChlorON-2 (K143R/R195I), and ChlorON-3 (K143R/R195L). <i>In vitro</i> spectroscopy revealed that all three sensors display a robust turn-on fluorescence response to chloride (20- to 45-fold) across a wide range of affinities (<i>K</i><sub>d</sub> ≈ 30-285 mM). We further showcase how this unique sensing mechanism can be exploited to directly image labile chloride transport with spatial and temporal resolution in a cell model overexpressing the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator. Building from this initial demonstration, we anticipate that the ChlorON technology will have broad utility, accelerating the path forward for fundamental and translational aspects of chloride biology.",

        "abstract": "Protein poly-ADP-ribosylation (PARylation) is a post-translational modification formed by transfer of successive units of ADP-ribose to target proteins to form poly-ADP-ribose (PAR) chains. PAR plays a critical role in the DNA damage response (DDR) by acting as a signaling platform to promote the recruitment of DNA repair factors to the sites of DNA damage that bind via their PAR-binding domains (PBDs). Several classes of PBD families have been recognized, which identify distinct parts of the PAR chain. Proteins encoding PBDs play an essential role in conveying the PAR-mediated signal through their interaction with PAR chains, which mediates many cellular functions, including the DDR. The WWE domain identifies the iso-ADP-ribose moiety of the PAR chain. We recently described the WWE domain of RNF146 as a robust genetically encoded probe, when fused to EGFP, for detection of PAR in live cells. Here, we evaluated other PBD candidates as molecular PAR probes in live cells, including several other WWE domains and an engineered macrodomain. In addition, we demonstrate unique PAR dynamics when tracked by different PAR binding domains, a finding that that can be exploited for modulation of the PAR-dependent DNA damage response.",

Sensors are commonly constructed by combining ligand-binding domains with one or more sensitized fluorescent protein (FP) domains. Sensors based on a single FP can be susceptible to artifacts caused by changes in sensor levels or distribution in vivo. To develop intensiometric sensors with the capacity for ratiometric quantification, dual-FP Matryoshka sensors were generated by using a single cassette with a large Stokes shift (LSS) reference FP nested within the reporter FP (cpEGFP). Here, we present a genetically encoded calcium sensor that employs green apple (GA) Matryoshka technology by incorporating a newly designed red LSSmApple fluorophore. LSSmApple matures faster and provides an optimized excitation spectrum overlap with cpEGFP, allowing for monochromatic coexcitation with blue light. The LSS of LSSmApple results in improved emission spectrum separation from cpEGFP, thereby minimizing fluorophore bleed-through and facilitating imaging using standard dichroic and red FP (RFP) emission filters. We developed an image analysis pipeline for yeast (<i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>) timelapse imaging that utilizes LSSmApple to segment and track cells for high-throughput quantitative analysis. In summary, we engineered a new FP, constructed a genetically encoded calcium indicator (GA-MatryoshCaMP6s), and performed calcium imaging in yeast as a demonstration.",

However, the classical quorum sensing paradigm is that Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria generally communicate via homoserine lactones (HSLs) or oligopeptide molecular signals, respectively, to elicit population responses. Here, we create synthetic HSL sensors for Gram-positive <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> 168 using allosteric LuxR-type regulators (RpaR, LuxR, RhlR, and CinR) and synthetic promoters. Promoters were combinatorially designed from different sequence elements (-35, -16, -10, and transcriptional start regions). We quantified the effects of these combinatorial promoters on sensor activity and determined how regulator expression affects its activation, achieving up to 293-fold activation. Using the statistical design of experiments, we identified significant effects of promoter regions and pairwise interactions on sensor activity, which helped to understand the sequence-function relationships for synthetic promoter design. We present the first known set of functional HSL sensors (≥20-fold dynamic range) in <i>B. subtilis</i> for four different HSL chemical signals: <i>p</i>-coumaroyl-HSL, 3-oxohexanoyl-HSL, <i>n</i>-butyryl-HSL, and <i>n</i>-(3-hydroxytetradecanoyl)-HSL.

However, whether OGT is involved in synaptic development and the mechanism underlying the process are largely unknown. In this study, we found that OGT-1, the OGT homolog in C. elegans, regulates the presynaptic assembly in AIY interneurons. The insulin receptor DAF-2 acts upstream of OGT-1 to promote the presynaptic assembly by positively regulating the expression of ogt-1.

GEFI encoding DNA can be expressed in cell subtypes while monitoring cellular physiological responses. However, engineering GEFIs with physiological sensitivity and pharmacological specificity often requires iterative optimization through trial-and-error mutagenesis while assessing their biophysical function <i>in vitro</i> one by one. Here, the vast mutational landscape of proteins constitutes a significant obstacle that slows GEFI development, particularly for sensors that rely on mammalian host systems for testing. To overcome these obstacles, we developed a multiplexed high-throughput engineering platform called the optogenetic microwell array screening system (Opto-MASS) that functionally tests thousands of GEFI variants in parallel in mammalian cells. Opto-MASS represents the next step for engineering optogenetic tools as it can screen large variant libraries orders of magnitude faster than current methods. We showcase this system by testing over 13,000 dopamine and 21,000 opioid sensor variants. We generated a new dopamine sensor, dMASS<sup>1</sup>, with a >6-fold signal increase to 100 nM dopamine exposure compared to its parent construct. Our new opioid sensor, μMASS<sup>1</sup>, has a ∼4.6-fold signal increase over its parent scaffold's response to 500 nM DAMGO. Thus, Opto-MASS can rapidly engineer new sensors while significantly shortening the optimization time for new sensors with distinct biophysical properties.",

Human TSH levels display both pulsatile and (nonpulsatile) basal TSH secretion patterns; however, the importance of these in regulating thyroid function and their decoding by the thyroid is unknown. Here, we developed a novel ultra-sensitive ELISA that allows precise detection of TSH secretion patterns with minute resolution in mouse models of health and disease. We characterized the patterns of ultradian TSH pulses in healthy, freely behaving mice over the day-night cycle. Challenge of the thyroid axis with primary hypothyroidism because of iodine deficiency, a major cause of thyroid dysfunction worldwide, results in alterations of TSH pulsatility. Induction in mouse models of sequential TSH pulses that mimic ultradian TSH profiles in periods of minutes were more efficient than sustained rises in basal TSH levels at increasing both thyroid follicle cAMP levels, as monitored with a genetically encoded cAMP sensor, and circulating thyroid hormone. Hence, this mouse TSH assay provides a powerful tool to decipher how ultradian TSH pulses encode thyroid outcomes and to uncover hidden parameters in the TSH-thyroid hormone set-point in health and disease.",

Generally, a single engineered \"landing pad\" site is introduced into the cell genome, permitting the integration of transgenic circuits or libraries of transgene variants. While sufficient for many studies, the extent of genetic manipulation possible with a single recombinase site is limiting and insufficient for more complex cell-based assays. Here, we harnessed two orthogonal Bxb1 recombinase sites to enable alternative avenues for using mammalian synthetic biology to characterize transgenic protein variants. By designing plasmids flanked by a second pair of auxiliary recombination sites, we demonstrate that we can avoid the genomic integration of undesirable bacterial DNA elements using the same starting cells engineered for whole-plasmid integration. We also created \"double landing pad\" cells simultaneously harboring two orthogonal Bxb1 recombinase sites at separate genomic loci, allowing complex cell-based genetic assays. Integration of a genetically encoded calcium indicator allowed for the real-time monitoring of intracellular calcium signaling dynamics, including kinetic perturbations that occur upon overexpression of the wild-type or variant version of the calcium signaling relay protein STIM1. A panel of missense mutants of the HIV-1 accessory protein Vif was paired with various paralogs within the human Apobec3 innate immune protein family to identify combinations capable or incapable of interacting within cells.

One challenge is a lack of methods for studying the dynamic nature of serotonin metabolism. Here, we report the development of a genetically encoded luminescent biosensor, termed iSero-Rluc, for the real-time detection of serotonin in live cells. The engineered serotonin binding domain (iSero) and Renilla luciferase (Rluc) reporter were cloned into yeast and mammalian expression vectors to create a fusion protein that could act as a biosensor to detect endogenous serotonin levels in live cells. The iSero-Rluc biosensor was stably expressed in the BON cell line and luciferase assays, mass spectroscopy, immunofluorescence, and Western blotting were used to study serotonin metabolism under different cell culture conditions. The iSero-Rluc sensor detected exogenous serotonin in a yeast model. When stably expressed in the BON cell line, iSero-Rluc revealed that serotonin biosynthesis is increased in an anchorage-independent growth state and is induced upon serum starvation. The iSero-Rluc biosensor is a powerful tool in the study of tumor serotonin metabolism. It enabled real-time detection of alterations in serotonin synthesis in living cells under various growth conditions and has the potential to provide greater insight into serotonin metabolism in different stages of tumor progression and to identify therapeutic strategies to target cancer metastases and carcinoid crises.",

However, our understanding of how calcium signaling regulates AE is still incomplete. In particular, the interplay between intra-acrosomal calcium dynamics and the intermediate steps leading to AE is not well-defined. Here, we describe a method that provides spatial and temporal insights into acrosomal calcium dynamics and their relationship to membrane fusion and subsequent exocytosis of the acrosome vesicle. The method utilizes a novel transgenic mouse expressing an Acrosome-targeted Sensor for Exocytosis (AcroSensE). The sensor combines a genetically encoded calcium indicator (GCaMP) fused with mCherry. This fusion protein was specifically designed to enable the concurrent observation of acrosomal calcium dynamics and membrane fusion events. Real-time monitoring of acrosomal calcium dynamics and AE in live AcroSensE sperm is achieved using a combination of high frame-rate imaging and a stimulant delivery system that can target single sperm. This protocol also provides several examples of basic methods to quantify and analyze the raw data. Because the AcroSensE model is genetically encoded, its scientific significance can be augmented by using readily available genetic tools, such as crossbreeding with other mouse genetic models or gene-editing (CRISPR) based methods. With this strategy, the roles of additional signaling pathways in sperm capacitation and fertilization can be resolved. In summary, the method described here provides a convenient and effective tool to study calcium dynamics in a specific subcellular compartment-the sperm acrosome-and how those dynamics regulate the intermediate steps leading to membrane fusion and acrosome exocytosis.",

        "abstract": "The intracellular concentrations of oxygen and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in living cells represent critical information for investigating physiological and pathological conditions. Real-time measurement often relies on genetically encoded proteins that are responsive to fluctuations in either oxygen or ROS concentrations. The direct binding or chemical reactions that occur in their presence either directly alter the fluorescence properties of the binding protein or alter the fluorescence properties of fusion partners, mostly consisting of variants of the green fluorescent protein. Oxygen sensing takes advantage of several mechanisms, including (i) the oxygen-dependent hydroxylation of a domain of the hypoxia-inducible factor-1, which, in turn, promotes its cellular degradation along with fluorescent fusion partners; (ii) the naturally oxygen-dependent maturation of the fluorophore of green fluorescent protein variants; and (iii) direct oxygen binding by proteins, including heme proteins, expressed in fusion with fluorescent partners, resulting in changes in fluorescence due to conformational alterations or fluorescence resonance energy transfer. ROS encompass a group of highly reactive chemicals that can interconvert through various chemical reactions within biological systems, posing challenges for their selective detection through genetically encoded sensors. However, their general reactivity, and particularly that of the relatively stable oxygen peroxide, can be exploited for ROS sensing through different mechanisms, including (i) the ROS-induced formation of disulfide bonds in engineered fluorescent proteins or fusion partners of fluorescent proteins, ultimately leading to fluorescence changes; and (ii) conformational changes of naturally occurring ROS-sensing domains, affecting the fluorescence properties of fusion partners.

Indeed, the <i>in vitro</i> neurodifferentiation of iPSCs, while recapitulating certain major stages of neurodevelopment <i>in vivo</i>, makes it possible to obtain networks of living human neurons. The culture model presented is particularly attractive within this framework since it involves iPSC-derived neural cells, which more specifically differentiate into cortical neurons of diverse types (in particular glutamatergic and GABAergic) and astrocytes. However, these <i>in vitro</i> neuronal networks, which may be heterogeneous in their degree of differentiation, remain challenging to bring to an appropriate level of maturation. It is therefore necessary to develop tools capable of analyzing a large number of cells to assess this maturation process. Calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) imaging, which has been extensively developed, undoubtedly offers an incredibly good approach, particularly in its versions using genetically encoded calcium indicators. However, in the context of these iPSC-derived neural cell cultures, there is a lack of studies that propose Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging methods that can finely characterize the evolution of neuronal maturation during the neurodifferentiation process. In this study, we propose a robust and reliable method for specifically measuring neuronal activity at two different time points of the neurodifferentiation process in such human neural cultures. To this end, we have developed a specific Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal analysis procedure and tested a series of different AAV serotypes to obtain expression levels of GCaMP6f under the control of the neuron-specific human synapsin1 (hSyn) promoter. The retro serotype has been found to be the most efficient in driving the expression of the GCaMP6f and is compatible with multi-time point neuronal Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging in our human iPSC-derived neural cultures. An AAV2/retro carrying GCaMP6f under the hSyn promoter (AAV2/retro-hSyn-GCaMP6f) is an efficient vector that we have identified. To establish the method, calcium measurements were carried out at two time points in the neurodifferentiation process with both hSyn and CAG promoters, the latter being known to provide high transient gene expression across various cell types. Our results stress that this methodology involving AAV2/retro-hSyn-GCaMP6f is suitable for specifically measuring neuronal calcium activities over multiple time points and is compatible with the neurodifferentiation process in our mixed human neural cultures.",

Here, we developed an in vivo assay using the Apollo-NADP<sup>+</sup> sensor and microfluidic devices to measure endogenous NADPH/NADP<sup>+</sup> dynamics in the pancreatic β cells of live zebrafish embryos. Flux through the pentose phosphate pathway, the main source of NADPH in many cell types, has been reported to be low in β cells. Thus, it is unclear how these cells compensate to meet NADPH demands. Using our assay, we show that pyruvate cycling is the main source of NADP<sup>+</sup> reduction in β cells, with contributions from folate cycling after acute electrical activation. INS1E β cells also showed a stress-induced increase in folate cycling and further suggested that this cycling requires both increased glycolytic intermediates and cytosolic NAD<sup>+</sup>.

Nutrient acquisition during infection is a promising target, and recent studies highlight the contributions of endomembrane trafficking, mitochondria, and vacuoles in the sensing and acquisition of heme by fungi. These studies have been facilitated by genetically encoded biosensors and other tools to quantitate heme in subcellular compartments and to investigate the dynamics of trafficking in living cells. In particular, the applications of biosensors in fungi have been extended beyond the detection of metabolites, cofactors, pH, and redox status to include the detection of heme. Here, we focus on studies that make use of biosensors to examine mechanisms of heme uptake and degradation, with guidance from the model fungus <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> and an emphasis on the pathogenic fungi <i>Candida albicans</i> and <i>Cryptococcus neoformans</i> that threaten human health.

        "abstract": "Biochemical processes within the living cell occur in a highly crowded environment, where macromolecules, first of all proteins and nucleic acids, occupy up to 30% of the volume. The phenomenon of macromolecular crowding is not an exclusive feature of the cytoplasm and can be observed in the densely protein-packed, nonhomogeneous cellular membranes and at the membrane interfaces. Crowding affects diffusional and conformational dynamics of proteins within the lipid bilayer, alters kinetic and thermodynamic properties of biochemical reactions, and modulates the membrane organization. Despite its importance, the non-invasive quantification of the membrane crowding is not trivial. Here, we developed a genetically-encoded fluorescence-based sensor for probing the macromolecular crowding at the membrane interfaces. Two sensor variants, both composed of fluorescent proteins and a membrane anchor, but differing by flexible linker domains were characterized in vitro, and the procedures for the membrane reconstitution were established. Steric pressure induced by membrane-tethered synthetic and protein crowders altered the sensors' conformation, causing increase in the intramolecular Förster's resonance energy transfer. Notably, the effect of protein crowders only weakly correlated with their molecular weight, suggesting that other factors, such as shape and charge contribute to the crowding via the quinary interactions. Finally, measurements performed in inner membrane vesicles of Escherichia coli validated the crowding-dependent dynamics of the sensors in the physiologically relevant environment. The sensors offer broad opportunities to study interfacial crowding in a complex environment of native membranes, and thus add to the toolbox of methods for studying membrane dynamics and proteostasis.",

We here provide an overview of light-activated transmembrane channels (optogenetic actuators) currently applied in strategies to modulate cardiac activity, as well as newly developed variants yet to be implemented in the heart. In addition, we touch upon genetically encoded indicators (optogenetic sensors) and fluorescent dyes to monitor tissue activity, including cardiac transmembrane potential and ion homeostasis. The combination of the two allows for all-optical approaches to monitor and manipulate the heart without any physical contact. However, spectral congestion poses a major obstacle, arising due to the overlap of excitation/activation and emission spectra of various optogenetic proteins and/or fluorescent dyes, resulting in optical crosstalk. Therefore, optogenetic proteins and fluorescent dyes should be carefully selected to avoid optical crosstalk and consequent disruptions in readouts and/or cellular activity. We here present a novel approach to simultaneously monitor transmembrane potential and cytosolic calcium, while also performing optogenetic manipulation. For this, we used the novel voltage-sensitive dye ElectroFluor 730p and the cytosolic calcium indicator X-Rhod-1 in mouse hearts expressing channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2). By exploiting the isosbestic point of ElectroFluor 730p and avoiding the ChR2 activation spectrum, we here introduce a novel optical imaging and manipulation approach with minimal crosstalk. Future developments in both optogenetic proteins and fluorescent dyes will allow for additional and more optimised strategies, promising a bright future for all-optical approaches in the field of cardiac electrophysiology.",

To test this, we first evaluated dLight photometry in mouse brain slices with simultaneous FSCV and found that both techniques yielded comparable results, but notable differences in responses to dopamine transporter inhibitors, including cocaine. We then used in vivo fiber photometry with dLight in mice to examine responses to cocaine in DLS. We also compared dopamine responses during Pavlovian conditioning across the striatum. We show that dopamine increases were readily detectable in DLS and describe transient dopamine kinetics, as well as slowly developing signals during conditioning. Overall, our findings indicate that dLight photometry is well suited to measuring dopamine dynamics in DLS.",

The sensor utilizes aptazyme as a recognition module and the light-up RNA aptamer as a signal reporter. The conformation of light-up aptamers is abrogated by a blocking sequence, and aptazyme-mediated cleavage restores the correct conformation, delivering activated fluorescence for small molecule imaging. We first developed a genetically encoded ratiometric sensor using Mango aptamer as a reference and SRB2 as a reporter. It is shown that the sensor allows quantitative imaging and detection of theophylline in live cells. The generality of the design is further demonstrated for imaging other small molecules by replacing the aptazymes. Its ability for multiplexed imaging of small molecules is further explored via the integration of different small-molecule responsive aptazymes and light-up RNA aptamers.

        "abstract": "Type 2 ryanodine receptor (RyR2) is a Ca<sup>2+</sup> release channel on the endoplasmic (ER)/sarcoplasmic reticulum that plays a central role in the excitation-contraction coupling in the heart. Hyperactivity of RyR2 has been linked to ventricular arrhythmias in patients with catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia and heart failure, where spontaneous Ca<sup>2+</sup> release via hyperactivated RyR2 depolarizes diastolic membrane potential to induce triggered activity. In such cases, drugs that suppress RyR2 activity are expected to prevent the arrhythmias, but there is no clinically available RyR2 inhibitors at present. In this study, we searched for RyR2 inhibitors from a well-characterized compound library using a recently developed ER Ca<sup>2+</sup>-based assay, where the inhibition of RyR2 activity was detected by the increase in ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals from R-CEPIA1er, a genetically encoded ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator, in RyR2-expressing HEK293 cells. By screening 1535 compounds in the library, we identified three compounds (chloroxylenol, methyl orsellinate, and riluzole) that greatly increased the ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal. All of the three compounds suppressed spontaneous Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations in RyR2-expressing HEK293 cells and correspondingly reduced the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent [<sup>3</sup>H]ryanodine binding activity. In cardiomyocytes from RyR2-mutant mice, the three compounds effectively suppressed abnormal Ca<sup>2+</sup> waves without substantial effects on the action-potential-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients. These results confirm that ER Ca<sup>2+</sup>-based screening is useful for identifying modulators of ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> release channels and suggest that RyR2 inhibitors have potential to be developed as a new category of antiarrhythmic drugs. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: We successfully identified three compounds having RyR2 inhibitory action from a well-characterized compound library using an endoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup>-based assay, and demonstrated that these compounds suppressed arrhythmogenic Ca<sup>2+</sup> wave generation without substantially affecting physiological action-potential induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in cardiomyocytes. This study will facilitate the development of RyR2-specific inhibitors as a potential new class of drugs for life-threatening arrhythmias induced by hyperactivation of RyR2.",

In a previous work, we have adapted to an animal system, Drosophila melanogaster, genetically encoded metabolic FRET-based sensors that had been previously developed in single-cell systems. These sensors provide semi-quantitative data on the stationary concentrations of key metabolites of the bioenergetic metabolism: lactate, pyruvate, and 2-oxoglutarate. The use of these sensors in intact organs required the development of an image processing method that minimizes the contribution of spatially complex autofluorescence patterns, that would obscure the FRET signals.

During development, the maturation of OHC afferent connectivity is refined by coordinated spontaneous Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity in both sensory and non-sensory cells. Calcium signalling in neonatal OHCs can be modulated by oncomodulin (OCM, β-parvalbumin), an EF-hand calcium-binding protein. Here, we investigated whether OCM regulates OHC spontaneous Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity and afferent connectivity during development. Using a genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor (GCaMP6s) expressed in OHCs in wild-type (Ocm<sup>+/+</sup> ) and Ocm knockout (Ocm<sup>-/-</sup> ) littermates, we found increased spontaneous Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity and upregulation of purinergic receptors in OHCs from Ocm<sup>-/-</sup> cochlea immediately following birth.

GEFIs are complex proteins with multiple dynamic states, rendering optimization by trial-and-error mutagenesis a challenging problem. We applied an alternative approach using machine learning to predict the outcomes of sensor mutagenesis by analyzing established libraries that link sensor sequences to functions. Using the GCaMP calcium indicator as a scaffold, we developed an ensemble of three regression models trained on experimentally derived GCaMP mutation libraries. We used the trained ensemble to perform an in silico functional screen on 1423 novel, uncharacterized GCaMP variants. As a result, we identified the novel ensemble-derived GCaMP (eGCaMP) variants, eGCaMP and eGCaMP+, that achieve both faster kinetics and larger fluorescent responses upon stimulation than previously published fast variants. Furthermore, we identified a combinatorial mutation with extraordinary dynamic range, eGCaMP2+, that outperforms the tested 6th, 7th, and 8th generation GCaMPs. These findings demonstrate the value of machine learning as a tool to facilitate the efficient pre-screening of mutants for functional characteristics. By leveraging the learning capabilities of our ensemble, we were able to accelerate the identification of promising mutations and reduce the experimental burden associated with trial-and-error mutagenesis.

We termed this tool the 'CaFE' reporter, for 'calcium during fertilization in C. elegans'. The CaFE reporter produced a robust signal that recapitulated the previously reported, biphasic nature of the calcium wave and had no significant deleterious effects on worm physiology or fecundity. Calcium waves were not observed at the restrictive temperature in the spe-9(hc88) strain, in which sperm can still trigger meiotic maturation but can no longer fuse with the oocyte. Demonstrating the utility of the CaFE reporter, we analyzed polyspermy induced by inhibition of egg-3 via RNAi and observed late calcium waves in the uterus. This finding provides support to the idea that calcium release is not restricted to the first sperm fusion event during polyspermy.

SenFol (Sensor for folic acid) is a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based nanosensor that we have developed by inserting folic acid-binding protein (FolT) as the folate detecting domain between the pair of enhanced cyan fluorescent protein (ECFP) and Venus. The developed sensor is highly specific, produces a quick signal, which is pH stable, and delivers precise, ratiometric readings in cell-based experiments. The projected affinity score of folic acid with FolT was -7.4 kcal/mol. The apparent affinity (K<sub>d</sub>) of SenFol for folic acid is 28.49 × 10<sup>-9</sup> M, with a detection range of 5 × 10<sup>-9</sup> M to 5 × 10<sup>-7</sup> M, and a maximum FRET ratio change of 0.45. WT SenFol, a highly efficient folic acid nanosensor, can dynamically detect intracellular folic acid content in E. coli, yeast, and HEK-293 T cells, confirming its potential.",

        "abstract": "Cellular physiology has been mainly studied by using two-dimensional cell culture substrates which lack in vivo-mimicking extracellular environment and interactions. Thus, there is a growing need for more complex model systems in life sciences. Micro-engineered scaffolds have been proven to be a promising tool in understanding the role of physical cues in the co-regulation of cellular functions. These tools allow, for example, probing cell morphology and migration in response to changes in chemo-physical properties of their microenvironment. In order to understand how microtopographical features, what cells encounter in vivo, affect cytoskeletal organization and nuclear mechanics, we used direct laser writing via two-photon polymerization (TPP) to fabricate substrates which contain different surface microtopographies. By combining with advanced high-resolution spectral imaging, we describe how the constructed grid and vertical line microtopographies influence cellular alignment, nuclear morphology and mechanics. Specifically, we found that growing cells on grids larger than 10 × 20 μm<sup>2</sup> and on vertical lines increased 3D actin cytoskeleton orientation along the walls of microtopographies and abolished basal actin stress fibers. In concert, the nuclei of these cells were also more aligned, elongated, deformed and less flattened, indicating changes in nuclear force transduction. Importantly, by using fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy for measuring Förster resonance energy transfer for a genetically encoded nesprin-2 molecular tension sensor, we show that growing cells on these microtopographic substrates induce lower mechanical tension at the nuclear envelope. To conclude, here used substrate microtopographies modulated the cellular mechanics, and affected actin organization and nuclear force transduction.",

        "title": "Detection of endogenous NPY release determined by novel GRAB sensor in cultured cortical neurons.",
        "abstract": "Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is an abundantly expressed peptide in the nervous system. Its widespread distribution along with its receptors, both centrally and peripherally, indicates its broad functions in numerous biological processes. However, the low endogenous concentration and diffuse distribution of NPY make it challenging to study its actions and dynamics directly and comprehensively. Studies on the role of NPY have primarily been limited to exogenous application, transgene expression, or knock-out in biological systems, which are often combined with pharmacological probes to delineate the involvement of specific NPY receptors. Therefore, to better understand the function of NPY in time and space, direct visualization of the real-time dynamics of endogenous NPY is a valuable and desired tool. Using the first-generation and newly developed intensiometric green fluorescent G-protein-coupled NPY sensor (GRAB NPY1.0), we, for the first time, demonstrate and characterize the direct detection of endogenously released NPY in cultured cortical neurons. A dose-dependent fluorescent signal was observed upon exogenous NPY application in nearly all recorded neurons. Pharmacologically evoked neuronal activity induced a significant increase in fluorescent signal in 32% of neurons, reflecting the release of NPY, despite only 3% of all neurons containing NPY. The remaining pool of neurons expressing the sensor were either non-responsive or displayed a notable decline in the fluorescent signal. Such decline in fluorescent signal was not rescued in cortical cultures transduced with an NPY overexpression vector, where 88% of the neurons were NPY-positive. Overexpression of NPY did, however, result in sensor signals that were more readily distinguishable. This may suggest that biological factors, such as subtle changes in intracellular pH, could interfere with the fluorescent signal, and thereby underestimate the release of endogenous NPY when using this new sensor in its present configuration. However, the development of next-generation NPY GRAB sensor technology is expected soon, and will eventually enable much-wanted studies on endogenous NPY release dynamics in both cultured and intact biological systems.",

        "title": "Genetically encoded phosphatidylserine biosensor for in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo labelling.",
        "abstract": "The dynamics of phosphatidylserine in the plasma membrane is a tightly regulated feature of eukaryotic cells. Phosphatidylserine (PS) is found preferentially in the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane. Disruption of this asymmetry leads to the exposure of phosphatidylserine on the cell surface and is associated with cell death, synaptic pruning, blood clotting and other cellular processes. Due to the role of phosphatidylserine in widespread cellular functions, an efficient phosphatidylserine probe is needed to study them. Currently, a few different phosphatidylserine labelling tools are available; however, these labels have unfavourable signal-to-noise ratios and are difficult to use in tissues due to limited permeability. Their application in living tissue requires injection procedures that damage the tissue and release damage-associated molecular patterns, which in turn stimulates phosphatidylserine exposure. For this reason, we developed a novel genetically encoded phosphatidylserine probe based on the C2 domain of the lactadherin (MFG-E8) protein, suitable for labelling exposed phosphatidylserine in various research models. We tested the C2 probe specificity to phosphatidylserine on hybrid bilayer lipid membranes by observing surface plasmon resonance angle shift. Then, we analysed purified fused C2 proteins on different cell culture lines or engineered AAVs encoding C2 probes on tissue cultures after apoptosis induction. For in vivo experiments, neurotropic AAVs were intravenously injected into perinatal mice, and after 2 weeks, brain slices were collected to observe C2-SNAP expression. The biophysical analysis revealed the high specificity of the C2 probe for phosphatidylserine. The fused recombinant C2 proteins were suitable for labelling phosphatidylserine on the surface of apoptotic cells in various cell lines. We engineered AAVs and validated them in organotypic brain tissue cultures for non-invasive delivery of the genetically encoded C2 probe and showed that these probes were expressed in the brain in vivo after intravenous AAV delivery to mice. We have demonstrated that the developed genetically encoded PS biosensor can be utilised in a variety of assays as a two-component system of C2 and C2m2 fusion proteins. This system allows for precise quantification and PS visualisation at directly specified threshold levels, enabling the evaluation of PS exposure in both physiological and cell death processes.",

With Pepper, we engineered various sensors for metabolites, synthetic compounds, proteins and metal ions in vitro and in living cells. In addition, these sensors show high activation and selectivity, demonstrating their universality and robustness. In the case of sensors responding to S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), a metabolite produced by methionine adenosyltransferase (MATase), we showed that our sensors exhibited positively correlated fluorescence responding to different SAM levels. Importantly, we revealed the SAM biosynthesis pathway and monitored MATase activity and gene expression spatiotemporally in living individual human cells. Additionally, we constructed a ratiometric SAM sensor to determine the inhibition efficacy of a MATase inhibitor in living cells. Together, these sensors comprising Pepper provide a useful platform for imaging diverse cellular targets and their signaling pathway.",

Most genetically encoded optical sensors currently used are based on fluorescence and have been highly successful tools for single-cell imaging in superficial brain regions. However, there remains a need to develop new tools for reporting neuronal activity <i>in vivo</i> within deeper structures without the need for hardware such as lenses or fibers to be implanted within the brain. Our approach to this problem is to replace the fluorescent elements of the existing biosensors with bioluminescent elements. This eliminates the need of external light sources to illuminate the sensor, thus allowing deeper brain regions to be imaged noninvasively. Here, we report the development of the first genetically encoded neurotransmitter indicators based on bioluminescent light emission. These probes were optimized by high-throughput screening of linker libraries. The selected probes exhibit robust changes in light output in response to the extracellular presence of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate. We expect this new approach to neurotransmitter indicator design to enable the engineering of specific bioluminescent probes for multiple additional neurotransmitters in the future, ultimately allowing neuroscientists to monitor activity associated with a specific neurotransmitter as it relates to behavior in a variety of neuronal and psychiatric disorders, among many other applications.",

Optical analyses of fluorescent sensor signals from colonies grown on solid media can be challenging as imaging devices need to be equipped with appropriate filters matching the properties of fluorescent biosensors. Toward versatile fluorescence analyses of different types of biosensor signals derived from arrayed colonies, we investigate here the use of monochromator equipped microplate readers as an alternative to imaging approaches. Indeed, for analyses of the LacI-controlled expression of the reporter mCherry in <i>Corynebacterium glutamicum,</i> or promoter activity using GFP as reporter in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, an improved sensitivity and dynamic range was observed for a microplate reader-based analyses compared to their analyses via imaging.

Applicability of this novel technique was further demonstrated by assessing redox states in <i>C. glutamicum</i> colonies using the FRP Mrx1-roGFP2. By the use of a microplate reader, oxidative redox shifts were measured in a mutant strain lacking the non-enzymatic antioxidant mycothiol (MSH), indicating its major role for maintaining a reduced redox state also in colonies on agar plates.

Our sensor is composed of a pair of dimeric enhanced green fluorescent proteins (dEGFPs) linked by a flexible amino-acid linker. We show dimerisation is perturbed by the addition of glycerol which interferes with the hydrophobic interaction of the two proteins. Time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy revealed a systematic attenuation of ultrafast fluorescence depolarisation when the sensor was exposed to increasing glycerol concentrations. This suggests that as hydrophobicity increases, dEGFP pairing decreases within a tandem dimer. Un-pairing of the protein fluorophores dramatically alters the rate of energy transfer between the proteins, resulting in an increase in the limiting anisotropy of the sensor.",

In order to study the functional roles of neuromodulatory transmitters in animal behaviors and brain disorders, new fluorescent sensors based on bacterial periplasmic binding proteins (PBPs) and G-protein coupled receptors have been developed, but their results have not been compared to or multiplexed with traditional methods such as electrophysiological recordings.

In general, genetically encoded sensors GRAB<sub><i>NE</i></sub> and GRAB<sub>5<i>HT</i>1</sub>.<sub>0</sub> showed better stability compared to electrophysiological recordings in detecting NE and 5-HT, while electrophysiological recordings had faster temporal kinetics in reporting ACh.

        "abstract": "Genetically encoded fluorescent biosensors provide an attractive means of measuring chemical changes in single cells on fast timescales (milliseconds to seconds). While their most prominent application has been in tracking neural activity and neurotransmitter release, there has been growing interest in developing and deploying new versions of these tools to study brain metabolism. However, the careful use of these tools and the interpretation of the data they provide remain challenging. Many biosensors are subject to interferences that can alter sensor responses within a single cell or between cells, producing ambiguous results. This presents a challenge for quantitation and for our ability to accurately interpret sensor responses. This review describes current methods of sensor quantitation, with a focus on cellular interferences that commonly affect sensor performance, ways to avoid false inferences, and recent advances in sensor optimization to make them more robust.",

        "abstract": "Photoacoustic microscopy can image many biological molecules and nano-agents in vivo via low-scattering ultrasonic sensing. Insufficient sensitivity is a long-standing obstacle for imaging low-absorbing chromophores with less photobleaching or toxicity, reduced perturbation to delicate organs, and more choices of low-power lasers. Here, the photoacoustic probe design is collaboratively optimized and a spectral-spatial filter is implemented. A multi-spectral super-low-dose photoacoustic microscopy (SLD-PAM) is presented that improves the sensitivity by ≈33 times. SLD-PAM can visualize microvessels and quantify oxygen saturation in vivo with ≈1% of the maximum permissible exposure, dramatically reducing potential phototoxicity or perturbation to normal tissue function, especially in imaging of delicate tissues, such as the eye and the brain. Capitalizing on the high sensitivity, direct imaging of deoxyhemoglobin concentration is achieved without spectral unmixing, avoiding wavelength-dependent errors and computational noises. With reduced laser power, SLD-PAM can reduce photobleaching by ≈85%. It is also demonstrated that SLD-PAM achieves similar molecular imaging quality using 80% fewer contrast agents. Therefore, SLD-PAM enables the use of a broader range of low-absorbing nano-agents, small molecules, and genetically encoded biomarkers, as well as more types of low-power light sources in wide spectra. It is believed that SLD-PAM offers a powerful tool for anatomical, functional, and molecular imaging.",

Genetically encoded sensors are powerful tools for studying nutrient distribution and dynamics, as they enable minimally invasive monitoring of nutrient steady-state levels in situ. Numerous types of genetically encoded sensors for nutrients have been designed and applied in mammalian cells and fungi. However, to date, their application for visualizing changing nutrient levels in planta remains limited. Systematic sensor-based approaches could provide the quantitative, kinetic information on tissue-specific, cellular, and subcellular distributions and dynamics of nutrients in situ that is needed for the development of theoretical nutrient flux models that form the basis for future crop engineering. Here, we review various approaches that can be used to measure nutrients in planta with an overview over conventional techniques, as well as genetically encoded sensors currently available for nutrient monitoring, and discuss their strengths and limitations. We provide a list of currently available sensors and summarize approaches for their application at the level of cellular compartments and organelles. When used in combination with bioassays on intact organisms and precise, yet destructive analytical methods, the spatiotemporal resolution of sensors offers the prospect of a holistic understanding of nutrient flux in plants.",

        "abstract": "Neuronal circuits in the brain that utilize the neurotransmitter serotonin are essential to the regulation of mood and emotional expression. Disruptions in serotonin signaling underlie neuropsychiatric conditions such as depression and anxiety. However, the cellular mechanisms that regulate serotonergic signaling in the brain in healthy and diseased states remain to be better understood. In particular, as more is learned about serotonin in the brain, we recognize an urgent need to develop techniques capable of mapping its complex spatiotemporal dynamics in awake, behaving animals. Notably, analytical methods to detect serotonin in situ, including tomography, are widely used but still recognized as limited in terms of their spatiotemporal resolution, their methodological caveats, and their technical limitations when cross-referenced with behavioral studies. To overcome such limitations, genetically encoded serotonin indicators were developed, leading to the introduction of novel imaging modalities that enable researchers to achieve remarkable spatiotemporal resolution in the study of serotonergic circuits in preclinical models of neuropsychiatric disorders. These novel approaches, while remarkably powerful, are also not without limitations. Here, we review the current techniques for detecting and quantifying serotonin in vivo within the brain and discuss how novel approaches such as genetically encoded serotonin indicators will lead to new insights into the roles of serotonergic circuits in health and disease.",

        "abstract": "Single-molecule force spectroscopy (SMFS) is powerful for studying folding states and mechanical properties of proteins, however, it requires protein immobilization onto force-transducing probes such as cantilevers or microbeads. A common immobilization method relies on coupling lysine residues to carboxylated surfaces using 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethyl-aminopropyl) carbodiimide and N-hydroxysuccinimide (EDC/NHS). Because proteins typically contain many lysine groups, this strategy results in a heterogeneous distribution of tether positions. Genetically encoded peptide tags (e.g., ybbR) provide alternative chemistries for achieving site-specific immobilization, but thus far a direct comparison of site-specific vs. lysine-based immobilization strategies to assess effects on the observed mechanical properties was lacking. Here, we compared lysine- vs. ybbR-based protein immobilization in SMFS assays using several model polyprotein systems. Our results show that lysine-based immobilization results in significant signal deterioration for monomeric streptavidin-biotin interactions, and loss of the ability to correctly classify unfolding pathways in a multipathway Cohesin-Dockerin system. We developed a mixed immobilization approach where a site-specifically tethered ligand was used to probe surface-bound proteins immobilized through lysine groups, and found partial recovery of specific signals. The mixed immobilization approach represents a viable alternative for mechanical assays on in vivo-derived samples or other proteins of interest where genetically encoded tags are not feasible.",

Successful application of GCaMP biosensors to a wide range of biological questions requires that sensor properties such as brightness and dynamic range, ligand affinity and response kinetics be tuned to the specific conditions or phenomena to be investigated. Random as well as rational targeted mutations of such sensor molecules have led to a number of important breakthroughs in this field, including the calcium sensors GCaMP6f and GCaMP6f<i><sub><i>u</i></sub></i>. jGCaMP8f of the most recently developed generation is promising a step-change in <i>in vivo</i> imaging with further increased fluorescence dynamic range.

We determined the <i>in vitro</i> biophysical properties of jGCaMP8f and selected variants by fluorescence spectroscopies and compared their performance monitoring intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients with previously developed fast and bright GCaMP sensors by live cell imaging. We demonstrate that the physiologically highly relevant Mg<sup>2+</sup> not only majorly affects the kinetic responses of GCaMPs but also their brightness and fluorescence dynamic range.

Despite substantial advances in the field of neurotoxicology, there remain significant knowledge gaps in our understanding of cellular targets and molecular mechanisms that mediate the neurotoxicological endpoints associated with exposure to both legacy contaminants and emerging contaminants of concern. Zebrafish are a powerful neurotoxicological model given their high degree sequence conservation with humans and the similarities they share with mammals in micro- and macro-level brain structures. Many zebrafish studies have effectively utilized behavioral assays to predict the neurotoxic potential of different compounds, but behavioral phenotypes are rarely able to predict the brain structures, cell types, or mechanisms affected by chemical exposures. Calcium-modulated photoactivatable ratiometric integrator (CaMPARI), a recently developed genetically-encoded calcium indicator, undergoes a permanent green to red switch in the presence of elevated intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations and 405-nm light, which allows for a \"snapshot\" of brain activity in freely-swimming larvae. To determine whether behavioral results are predictive of patterns of neuronal activity, we assessed the effects of three common neurotoxicants, ethanol, 2,2',3,5',6-pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB 95), and monoethylhexyl phthalate (MEHP), on both brain activity and behavior by combining the behavioral light/dark assay with CaMPARI imaging. We demonstrate that brain activity profiles and behavioral phenotypes are not always concordant and, therefore, behavior alone is not sufficient to understand how toxicant exposure affects neural development and network dynamics. We conclude that pairing behavioral assays with functional neuroimaging tools such as CaMPARI provides a more comprehensive understanding of the neurotoxic endpoints of compounds while still offering a relatively high throughput approach to toxicity testing.",

In recent years, the modular architecture of natural bacterial RNA riboswitches has inspired the design of genetically encoded synthetic RNA devices that convert the intracellular concentration of a metabolite into a quantitative fluorescent signal. These so-called RNA-based sensors are composed of a metabolite-binding RNA aptamer as the sensor domain, connected through an actuator segment to a signal-generating reporter domain. However, at present, the variety of available RNA-based sensors for intracellular metabolites is still very limited. Here, we go through natural mechanisms for metabolite sensing and regulation in cells across all kingdoms, focusing on those mediated by riboswitches.

A new dimension in protein imaging can be offered by combining protein tags with polarity-sensitive fluorescent probes, which provide information about local nanoscale environments of target proteins within the subcellular compartments (organelles). Here, we designed three fluorescent probes based on solvatochromic nile red dye, conjugated to a HaloTag reactive targeting group through polyethylene glycol linkers of varying lengths. The probe with medium linker length, NR12-Halo, was found to label specifically a large variety of proteins localized in defined cell compartments, such as plasma membranes (outer and inner leaflets), endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, cytosol, microtubules, actin, and chromatin. Owing to its polarity-sensitive fluorophore, the probe clearly distinguished the proteins localized within apolar lipid membranes from other proteins. Moreover, it revealed dramatic changes in the environment during the life cycle of proteins from biosynthesis to their expected localization and, finally, to recycling inside lysosomes. Heterogeneity in the local polarity of some membrane proteins also suggested a formation of low-polar protein aggregates, for example, within cell-cell contacts. The approach also showed that mechanical stress (cell shrinking by osmotic shock) induced a general polarity decrease in membrane proteins, probably due to the condensation of biomolecules. Finally, the nanoenvironment of some membrane proteins was affected by a polyunsaturated fatty acid diet, which provided the bridge between organization of lipids and proteins. The developed solvatochromic HaloTag probe constitutes a promising tool for probing nanoscale environments of proteins and their interactions within subcellular structures.",

H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> can diffuse across membranes, has a low reactivity, and is very stable. Deprotonated cysteine residues in proteins can be oxidized by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> into a highly reactive sulfenic acid derivative (-SOH), which can react with another cysteine to form a disulfide. Under higher oxidative stress the sulfenic acid undergo further oxidation to sulfinic acid (Cys-SO<sub>2</sub>H), which can subsequently be reduced. The sulfinic acid can be hyperoxidized to sulfonic acid (Cys-SO<sub>3</sub>H), whose reduction is irreversible. Formation of sulfenic acids can have a role in sensing oxidative stress, signal transduction, modulating localization and activity to regulate protein functions. Therefore, there is an emerging interest in trying to understand the pool of proteins that result in these sorts of modification in response to oxidative stress. This is known as the sulfenome and several approaches have been developed in animal and plant cells to analyze the sulfenome under different stress responses. These approaches can be proteomic, molecular, immunological (i.e., antibodies), or expressing genetically encoded probes that specifically react to sulfenic modifications.

Fluorescent probes have identified Zn<sup>2+</sup> in cells but complementary approaches employing nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) are lacking. Recent studies of maltose binding protein (MBP) using ultrasensitive <sup>129</sup>Xe NMR spectroscopy identified a switchable salt bridge which causes slow xenon exchange and elicits strong hyperpolarized <sup>129</sup>Xe chemical exchange saturation transfer (hyper-CEST) NMR contrast. To engineer the first genetically encoded, NMR-active sensor for Zn<sup>2+</sup>, we converted the MBP salt bridge into a Zn<sup>2+</sup> binding site, while preserving the specific xenon binding cavity. The zinc sensor (ZS) at only 1 μM achieved 'turn-on' detection of Zn<sup>2+</sup> with pronounced hyper-CEST contrast. This made it possible to determine different Zn<sup>2+</sup> levels in a biological fluid <i>via</i> hyper-CEST. ZS was responsive to low-micromolar Zn<sup>2+</sup>, only modestly responsive to Cu<sup>2+</sup>, and nonresponsive to other biologically important metal ions, according to hyper-CEST NMR spectroscopy and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). Protein X-ray crystallography confirmed the identity of the bound Zn<sup>2+</sup> ion using anomalous scattering: Zn<sup>2+</sup> was coordinated with two histidine side chains and three water molecules. Penta-coordinate Zn<sup>2+</sup> forms a hydrogen-bond-mediated gate that controls the Xe exchange rate. Metal ion binding affinity, <sup>129</sup>Xe NMR chemical shift, and exchange rate are tunable parameters <i>via</i> protein engineering, which highlights the potential to develop proteins as selective metal ion sensors for NMR spectroscopy and imaging.",

Here, we present a point mutation that increases the sensitivity of Ace2 opsin-based voltage indicators. We use the mutation to develop Voltron2, an improved chemigeneic voltage indicator that has a 65% higher sensitivity to single APs and 3-fold higher sensitivity to subthreshold potentials than Voltron. Voltron2 retained the sub-millisecond kinetics and photostability of its predecessor, although with lower baseline fluorescence. In multiple in vitro and in vivo comparisons with its predecessor across multiple species, we found Voltron2 to be more sensitive to APs and subthreshold fluctuations. Finally, we used Voltron2 to study and evaluate the possible mechanisms of interneuron synchronization in the mouse hippocampus. Overall, we have discovered a generalizable mutation that significantly increases the sensitivity of Ace2 rhodopsin-based sensors, improving their voltage reporting capability.",

        "abstract": "Activated glia are known to exhibit either neuroprotective or neurodegenerative effects, depending on their phenotype, while participating in chronic pain regulation. Until recently, it has been believed that satellite glial cells and astrocytes are electrically slight and process stimuli only through intracellular calcium flux that triggers downstream signaling mechanisms. Though glia do not exhibit action potentials, they do express both voltage- and ligand-gated ion channels that facilitate measurable calcium transients, a measure of their own phenotypic excitability, and support and modulate sensory neuron excitability through ion buffering and secretion of excitatory or inhibitory neuropeptides (i.e., paracrine signaling). We recently developed a model of acute and chronic nociception using co-cultures of iPSC sensory neurons (SN) and spinal astrocytes on microelectrode arrays (MEAs). Until recently, only neuronal extracellular activity has been recorded using MEAs with a high signal-to-noise ratio and in a non-invasive manner. Unfortunately, this method has limited compatibility with simultaneous calcium transient imaging techniques, which is the most common method for monitoring the phenotypic activity of astrocytes. Moreover, both dye-based and genetically encoded calcium indicator imaging rely on calcium chelation, affecting the culture's long-term physiology. Therefore, it would be ideal to allow continuous and simultaneous direct phenotypic monitoring of both SNs and astrocytes in a high-to-moderate throughput non-invasive manner and would significantly advance the field of electrophysiology. Here, we characterize astrocytic oscillating calcium transients (OCa<sup>2+</sup>Ts) in mono- and co-cultures of iPSC astrocytes as well as iPSC SN-astrocyte co-cultures on 48 well plate MEAs. We demonstrate that astrocytes exhibit OCa<sup>2+</sup>Ts in an electrical stimulus amplitude- and duration-dependent manner. We show that OCa<sup>2+</sup>Ts can be pharmacologically inhibited with the gap junction antagonist, carbenoxolone (100 μM). Most importantly, we demonstrate that both neurons and glia can be phenotypically characterized in real time, repeatedly, over the duration of the culture. In total, our findings suggest that calcium transients in glial populations may serve as a stand-alone or supplemental screening technique for identifying potential analgesics or compounds targeting other glia-mediated pathologies.",

        "abstract": "The free calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) levels in pancreatic beta cell organelles have been the subject of many recent investigations. Under pathophysiological conditions, disturbances in these pools have been linked to altered intracellular communication and cellular dysfunction. To facilitate studies of subcellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in beta cells and, particularly, signaling between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria, we designed a novel dual Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor which we termed DS-1. DS-1 encodes two stoichiometrically fluorescent proteins within a single plasmid, G-CEPIA-er, targeted to the ER and R-CEPIA3-mt, targeted to mitochondria. Our goal was to simultaneously measure the ER and mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> in cells in real time. The <i>K<sub>ds</sub></i> of G-CEPIA-er and R-CEPIA3-mt for Ca<sup>2+</sup> are 672 and 3.7 μM, respectively. Confocal imaging of insulin-secreting INS-1 832/13 expressing DS-1 confirmed that the green and red fluorophores correctly colocalized with organelle-specific fluorescent markers as predicted. Further, we tested whether DS-1 exhibited the functional properties expected by challenging an INS-1 cell to glucose concentrations or drugs having well-documented effects on the ER and mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling. The data obtained were consistent with those seen using other single organelle targeted probes. These results taken together suggest that DS-1 is a promising new approach for investigating Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling within multiple organelles of the cell.",

Still, the exact mechanism governing magnesium transport by this protein complex is not well understood. Herein, we have developed a genetically encoded intracellular magnesium-specific reporter and demonstrate that the CNNM family inhibits the function of the TRPM7 magnesium channel. We show that the small GTPase ARL15 increases CNNM3/TRPM7 protein complex formation to reduce TRPM7 activity. Conversely, PRL-2 overexpression counteracts ARL15 binding to CNNM3 and enhances the function of TRPM7 by preventing the interaction between CNNM3 and TRPM7. Moreover, while TRPM7-induced cell signaling is promoted by PRL-1/2, it is reduced when CNNM3 is overexpressed. Lowering cellular magnesium levels reduces the interaction of CNNM3 with TRPM7 in a PRL-dependent manner, whereby knockdown of PRL-1/2 restores the protein complex formation. Cotargeting of TRPM7 and PRL-1/2 alters mitochondrial function and sensitizes cells to metabolic stress induced by magnesium depletion. These findings reveal the dynamic regulation of TRPM7 function in response to PRL-1/2 levels, to coordinate magnesium transport and reprogram cellular metabolism.",

        "abstract": "Synaptic transmission relies on presynaptic neurotransmitter (NT) release from synaptic vesicles (SVs) and on NT detection by postsynaptic receptors. Transmission exists in two principal modes: action-potential (AP) evoked and AP-independent, \"spontaneous\" transmission. AP-evoked neurotransmission is considered the primary mode of inter-neuronal communication, whereas spontaneous transmission is required for neuronal development, homeostasis, and plasticity. While some synapses appear dedicated to spontaneous transmission only, all AP-responsive synapses also engage spontaneously, but whether this encodes functional information regarding their excitability is unknown. Here we report on functional interdependence of both transmission modes at individual synaptic contacts of <i>Drosophila</i> larval neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) which were identified by the presynaptic scaffolding protein Bruchpilot (BRP) and whose activities were quantified using the genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator GCaMP. Consistent with the role of BRP in organizing the AP-dependent release machinery (voltage-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels and SV fusion machinery), most active BRP-positive synapses (>85%) responded to APs. At these synapses, the level of spontaneous activity was a predictor for their responsiveness to AP-stimulation. AP-stimulation resulted in cross-depletion of spontaneous activity and both transmission modes were affected by the non-specific Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel blocker cadmium and engaged overlapping postsynaptic receptors. Thus, by using overlapping machinery, spontaneous transmission is a continuous, stimulus independent predictor for the AP-responsiveness of individual synapses.",

        "abstract": "Exosomes contain a plethora of unique disease biomarkers involving cellular homeostasis, infection dissemination, cancer development, and cardiac diseases. Exosomes originating from cancer cells have promising biomarkers for the early detection and assessment of the therapeutic response to cancer. The exosomal epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a potential biomarker which is overexpressed in cancer; thus, the level of EGFR expression is investigated by so many methods in a liquid and solid biopsy. The optimal method for isolating pure exosomal EGFRs has not been well understood so far. Current approaches are complicated and time-consuming, therefore hampering their clinical applications. Here, we demonstrate the creation of an innovative fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) sensor, named ExoSen (exosome sensor), which can be implemented to determine the concentration of exosomal EGFRs at in vitro as well as in vivo levels. In this study, a sensing element for A549 exosomes, mitogen-inducible gene 6 (MIG6), has been employed between the FRET pair ECFP and Venus. MIG6 binding to ExoSen induced a conformational change that can be monitored by a variation in the FRET ratio. Moreover, the developed sensor, expressed in bacterial, yeast, and HEK-293T cells, demonstrates an increased FRET ratio with the addition of A549 exosomes, which can quantify the A549 exosomes noninvasively. The ExoSen enables rapid detection of A549 exosomes with great sensitivity at a concentration of 3.5 × 10<sup>9</sup> particles/mL. ExoSen is stable to pH fluctuations and provides a highly accurate, real-time optical readout in cell-based experiments by using confocal microscopy.",

We could demonstrate a quantitative sensor response of two cell types to reduced oxygen supply in 2D and reveal different thresholds for hypoxic response.

Unfortunately, many HSCR patients have persistent dysmotility (e.g., constipation, incontinence) and enterocolitis after surgery, suggesting that the remaining bowel is not normal despite having ENS ganglia. Anatomical and neurochemical alterations have been observed in the ENS-innervated proximal bowel from HSCR patients and mice, but no studies have recorded ENS activity to define the circuit mechanisms underlying post-surgical HSCR dysfunction. Here, we generated a HSCR mouse model with a genetically-encoded calcium indicator to map the ENS connectome in the proximal colon. We identified abnormal spontaneous and synaptic ENS activity in proximal colons from GCaMP-Ednrb <sup>-/-</sup> mice with HSCR that corresponded to motor dysfunction. Many HSCR-associated defects were also observed in GCaMP-Ednrb <sup>+/-</sup> mice, despite complete ENS innervation. Results suggest that functional abnormalities in the ENS-innervated bowel contribute to post-surgical bowel complications in HSCR patients, and HSCR-related mutations that do not cause aganglionosis may cause chronic colon dysfunction in patients without a HSCR diagnosis.",

The genetically encoded sensor rapidly detects intracellular LC-acyl-CoAs generated from exogenous and endogenous fatty acids (FAs), as well as synthetic ABHD5 ligands. Stimulation of lipolysis in brown adipocytes elevated intracellular LC-acyl-CoAs in a cyclic fashion, which was eliminated by inhibiting PNPLA2 (ATGL), the major triglyceride lipase. Interestingly, inhibition of LC-acyl-CoA transport into mitochondria elevated intracellular LC-acyl-CoAs and dampened their cycling. Together, these observations reveal an intimate feedback control between LC-acyl-CoA generation from lipolysis and utilization in mitochondria.

The excellent performance of this probe is largely due to the recognition element of the probe, MerBD, which adopts an unusual planar trigonometric coordination configuration with Hg<sup>2+</sup>, and the coordination can cause enough conformational change to influence the fluorescence of skeleton protein sfGFP coupled with it. The small peptide MerBD was delicately designed based on the three-dimensional structure of metalloprotein MerR. This novel design strategy solves the challenging problems that there are few natural functional proteins in the process of constructing fluorescent probes for toxic metal ions and some functional proteins cannot be directly used as recognition elements.

These peripheral nerves are composed of distinct subsets of fibers and associated cell bodies, which reside in peripheral ganglia distributed throughout the viscera and along the spinal cord. The vagus nerve (cranial nerve X) is a complex polymodal nerve that transmits a wide array of sensory information, including signals related to mechanical, chemical, and noxious stimuli. To understand how stimuli applied to the vagus nerve are encoded by vagal sensory neurons in the jugular-nodose ganglia, we developed a framework for micro-endoscopic calcium imaging and analysis.<i>Approach.</i>We developed novel methods for<i>in vivo</i>imaging of the intact jugular-nodose ganglion using a miniature microscope (Miniscope) in transgenic mice with the genetically-encoded calcium indicator GCaMP6f. We adapted the Python-based analysis package Calcium Imaging Analysis (CaImAn) to process the resulting one-photon fluorescence data into calcium transients for subsequent analysis. Random forest classification was then used to identify specific types of neuronal responders.<i>Results.</i>We demonstrate that recordings from the jugular-nodose ganglia can be accomplished through careful surgical dissection and ganglia stabilization. Using a customized acquisition and analysis pipeline, we show that subsets of vagal sensory neurons respond to different chemical stimuli applied to the vagus nerve. Successful classification of the responses with a random forest model indicates that certain calcium transient features, such as amplitude and duration, are important for encoding these stimuli by sensory neurons.<i>Significance.</i>This experimental approach presents a new framework for investigating how individual vagal sensory neurons encode various stimuli on the vagus nerve.

        "title": "Real-Time Visualization of Cytosolic and Mitochondrial ATP Dynamics in Response to Metabolic Stress in Cultured Cells.",
        "abstract": "Adenosine 5' triphosphate (ATP) is the energy currency of life, which is produced in mitochondria (~90%) and cytosol (less than 10%). Real-time effects of metabolic changes on cellular ATP dynamics remain indeterminate. Here we report the design and validation of a genetically encoded fluorescent ATP indicator that allows for real-time, simultaneous visualization of cytosolic and mitochondrial ATP in cultured cells. This dual-ATP indicator, called smacATPi (simultaneous mitochondrial and cytosolic ATP indicator), combines previously described individual cytosolic and mitochondrial ATP indicators. The use of smacATPi can help answer biological questions regarding ATP contents and dynamics in living cells. As expected, 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG, a glycolytic inhibitor) led to substantially decreased cytosolic ATP, and oligomycin (a complex V inhibitor) markedly decreased mitochondrial ATP in cultured HEK293T cells transfected with smacATPi. With the use of smacATPi, we can also observe that 2-DG treatment modestly attenuates mitochondrial ATP and oligomycin reduces cytosolic ATP, indicating the subsequent changes of compartmental ATP. To evaluate the role of ATP/ADP carrier (AAC) in ATP trafficking, we treated HEK293T cells with an AAC inhibitor, Atractyloside (ATR). ATR treatment attenuated cytosolic and mitochondrial ATP in normoxia, suggesting AAC inhibition reduces ADP import from the cytosol to mitochondria and ATP export from mitochondria to cytosol. In HEK293T cells subjected to hypoxia, ATR treatment increased mitochondrial ATP along with decreased cytosolic ATP, implicating that ACC inhibition during hypoxia sustains mitochondrial ATP but may not inhibit the reversed ATP import from the cytosol. Furthermore, both mitochondrial and cytosolic signals decrease when ATR is given in conjunction with 2-DG in hypoxia. Thus, real-time visualization of spatiotemporal ATP dynamics using smacATPi provides novel insights into how cytosolic and mitochondrial ATP signals respond to metabolic changes, providing a better understanding of cellular metabolism in health and disease.",

The 8 mm long bundle is made of a pair of heavy-metal oxide glasses with a refractive index contrast of 0.38 to ensure a high numerical aperture NA = 1.15. The bundle is composed of 825 multimode cores, ordered in a hexagonal lattice with a pixel size of 14 μm and a total diameter of 914 μm. We demonstrate successful imaging through custom-made bundles with 14 μm resolution. As the input, we used a 910 nm Ti-sapphire laser with 140 fs pulse and a peak power of 9 × 10<sup>4</sup> W. The excitation beam and fluorescent image were transferred through the fiber imaging bundle. As test samples, we used 1 μm green fluorescent latex beads, ex vivo hippocampal neurons expressing green fluorescent protein and cortical neurons in vivo expressing the fluorescent reporter GCaMP6s or immediate early gene Fos fluorescent reporter. This system can be used for minimal-invasive in vivo imaging of the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, or deep brain areas as a part of a tabletop system or an implantable setup.

Inappropriate levels of SeCys can be considered as a sign of various diseases. Therefore, small molecular fluorescent probes for the detection and imaging of SeCys <i>in vivo</i> in biological systems are considered to be of significant interest for understanding the physiological role of SeCys. Thus, this article mainly provides a critical evaluation of recent advances made in SeCys detection along with the biomedical applications based on small molecular fluorescent probes published in the literature during the past half a dozen years. Therefore, the article primarily deals with the rational design of fluorescent probes, wherein these were selective towards SeCys over other biologically abundant molecules, in particular the thiol-based ones. The detection has been monitored by different spectral techniques, such as fluorescence and absorption spectroscopy and in some cases even visual color changes. Further, the detection mechanism and the utility of fluorescent probes for <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> cell imaging applications are addressed. For clarity, the main features have been conveniently divided into four categories based on the chemical reactions of the probe, <i>viz.</i>, in terms of the cleavage of the responsive group by the SeCys nucleophile: (i) 2,4-dinitrobene sulphonamide group, (ii) 2,4-dinitrobenesulfonate ester group, (iii) 2,4-dinitrobenzeneoxy group and (iv) miscellaneous types.

        "abstract": "The cytoplasm is a complex, crowded, actively driven environment whose biophysical characteristics modulate critical cellular processes such as cytoskeletal dynamics, phase separation, and stem cell fate. Little is known about the variance in these cytoplasmic properties. Here, we employed particle-tracking nanorheology on genetically encoded multimeric 40 nm nanoparticles (GEMs) to measure diffusion within the cytoplasm of individual fission yeast (Schizosaccharomyces pombe) cellscells. We found that the apparent diffusion coefficients of individual GEM particles varied over a 400-fold range, while the differences in average particle diffusivity among individual cells spanned a 10-fold range. To determine the origin of this heterogeneity, we developed a Doppelgänger simulation approach that uses stochastic simulations of GEM diffusion that replicate the experimental statistics on a particle-by-particle basis, such that each experimental track and cell had a one-to-one correspondence with their simulated counterpart. These simulations showed that the large intra- and inter-cellular variations in diffusivity could not be explained by experimental variability but could only be reproduced with stochastic models that assume a wide intra- and inter-cellular variation in cytoplasmic viscosity. The simulation combining intra- and inter-cellular variation in viscosity also predicted weak nonergodicity in GEM diffusion, consistent with the experimental data. To probe the origin of this variation, we found that the variance in GEM diffusivity was largely independent of factors such as temperature, the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons, cell-cyle stage, and spatial locations, but was magnified by hyperosmotic shocks. Taken together, our results provide a striking demonstration that the cytoplasm is not \"well-mixed\" but represents a highly heterogeneous environment in which subcellular components at the 40 nm size scale experience dramatically different effective viscosities within an individual cell, as well as in different cells in a genetically identical population. These findings carry significant implications for the origins and regulation of biological noise at cellular and subcellular levels.",

        "abstract": "Understanding of the neural bases for complex behaviors in Hymenoptera insect species has been limited by a lack of tools that allow measuring neuronal activity simultaneously in different brain regions. Here, we developed the first pan-neuronal genetic driver in a Hymenopteran model organism, the honey bee, and expressed the calcium indicator GCaMP6f under the control of the honey bee synapsin promoter. We show that GCaMP6f is widely expressed in the honey bee brain, allowing to record neural activity from multiple brain regions. To assess the power of this tool, we focused on the olfactory system, recording simultaneous responses from the antennal lobe, and from the more poorly investigated lateral horn (LH) and mushroom body (MB) calyces. Neural responses to 16 distinct odorants demonstrate that odorant quality (chemical structure) and quantity are faithfully encoded in the honey bee antennal lobe. In contrast, odor coding in the LH departs from this simple physico-chemical coding, supporting the role of this structure in coding the biological value of odorants. We further demonstrate robust neural responses to several bee pheromone odorants, key drivers of social behavior, in the LH. Combined, these brain recordings represent the first use of a neurogenetic tool for recording large-scale neural activity in a eusocial insect and will be of utility in assessing the neural underpinnings of olfactory and other sensory modalities and of social behaviors and cognitive abilities.",

        "abstract": "Functional neuroimaging is a powerful tool for evaluating how local and global brain circuits evolve after focal ischemia and how these changes relate to functional recovery. For example, acutely after stroke, changes in functional brain organization relate to initial deficit and are predictive of recovery potential. During recovery, the reemergence and restoration of connections lost due to stroke correlate with recovery of function. Thus, information gleaned from functional neuroimaging can be used as a proxy for behavior and inform on the efficacy of interventional strategies designed to affect plasticity mechanisms after injury. And because these findings are consistently observed across species, bridge measurements can be made in animal models to enrich findings in human stroke populations. In mice, genetic engineering techniques have provided several new opportunities for extending optical neuroimaging methods to more direct measures of neuronal activity. These developments are especially useful in the context of stroke where neurovascular coupling can be altered, potentially limiting imaging measures based on hemodynamic activity alone. This chapter is designed to give an overview of functional wide-field optical imaging (WFOI) for applications in rodent models of stroke, primarily in the mouse. The goal is to provide a protocol for laboratories that want to incorporate an affordable functional neuroimaging assay into their current research thrusts, but perhaps lack the background knowledge or equipment for developing a new arm of research in their lab. Within, we offer a comprehensive guide developing and applying WFOI technology with the hope of facilitating accessibility of neuroimaging technology to other researchers in the stroke field.",

Monitoring and silencing peptidergic and glutamatergic transmissions from presynaptic terminals using our newly developed tools and existing genetic tools, respectively, reveal that neuropeptides, not glutamate, are the primary transmitter in encoding unconditioned stimulus during Pavlovian threat learning. These results show that our sensor and silencer for peptidergic transmission are reliable tools to investigate neuropeptidergic systems in awake behaving animals.",

This unique property was previously used to label neurons based upon their tuning properties in order to map synaptic connectivity and to record large-scale neuronal activity in freely moving mice without attaching any mechanical device to them. The latest version of CaMPARI (CaMPARI2) was engineered to enhance the contrast generated by photoconverting the green protein to the activity-dependent red form and to reduce the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent photoconversion rate compared to the first generation of CaMPARI (CaMPARI1). However, here we show that this optimization process also resulted in reduced photoconversion efficiency of active neurons in the mouse cortex and hippocampus. Through side-by-side comparison of the two CaMPARI sensors under several experimental conditions, we show that CaMPARI1 exhibits a substantially higher red-to-green ratio in active cells than CaMPARI2. In addition, we show that CaMPARI1 also functions as a more sensitive traditional Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor than CaMPARI2 by producing larger activity-driven dynamic fluorescence changes in the observed neurons. Therefore, we conclude that during the optimization process of CaMPARI2, some of the sensor's characteristics were not predicted properly by <i>in vitro</i> screening assays, and therefore <i>in vivo</i> screening and validation steps should be included in future optimization attempts to increase the predictability of screening pipelines.",

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a highly aggressive hematopoietic malignancy characterized by aberrant levels of reduced and oxidized GSH due to oxidative stress. Therefore, the real-time, dynamic, and highly sensitive detection of GSH/GSSG in AML cells is of great interest for the clinical diagnosis and treatment of leukemia. The application of genetically encoded sensors to monitor GSH/GSSG levels in AML cells is not explored, and the underlying mechanism of how the drugs affect GSH/GSSG dynamics remains unclear. In this study, we developed subcellular compartment-specific sensors to monitor GSH/GSSG combined with high-resolution fluorescence microscopy that provides insights into basal GSH/GSSG levels in the cytosol, mitochondria, nucleus, and endoplasmic reticulum of AML cells, in a decreasing order, revealing substantial heterogeneity of GSH/GSSG level dynamics in different subcellular compartments. Further, we investigated the response of GSH/GSSG ratio in AML cells caused by Prussian blue and Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> nanoparticles, separately and in combination with cytarabine, pointing to steep gradients. Moreover, cytarabine and doxorubicin downregulated the GSH/GSSG levels in different subcellular compartments. Similarly, live-cell imaging showed a compartment-specific decrease in response to various drugs, such as CB-839, parthenolide (PTL), and piperlongumine (PLM). The enzymatic activity assay revealed the mechanism underlying fluctuations in GSH/GSSG levels in different subcellular compartments mediated by these drugs in the GSH metabolic pathway, suggesting some potential therapeutic targets in AML cells.",

Anhydrobiosis has been a biological enigma for more than a century with respect to how organisms sustain life without water, but the few choices of genetic toolkits available in tardigrade research have been a challenging circumstance. Here, we report the development of an in vivo expression system for tardigrades. This transient transgenic technique is based on a plasmid vector (TardiVec) with promoters that originated from an anhydrobiotic tardigrade <i>Ramazzottius varieornatus</i>. It enables the introduction of GFP-fused proteins and genetically encoded indicators such as the Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator GCaMP into tardigrade cells; consequently, the dynamics of proteins and cells in tardigrades may be observed by fluorescence live imaging. This system is applicable for several tardigrades in the class Eutardigrada: the promoters of anhydrobiosis-related genes showed tissue-specific expression in this work. Surprisingly, promoters functioned similarly between multiple species, even for species with different modes of expression of anhydrobiosis-related genes, such as <i>Hypsibius exemplaris,</i> in which these genes are highly induced upon facing desiccation, and <i>Thulinius ruffoi</i>, which lacks anhydrobiotic capability. These results suggest that the highly dynamic expression changes in desiccation-induced species are regulated in <i>trans</i>. Tissue-specific expression of tardigrade-unique unstructured proteins also suggests differing anhydrobiosis machinery depending on the cell types. We believe that tardigrade transgenic technology opens up various experimental possibilities in tardigrade research, especially to explore anhydrobiosis mechanisms.",

An involvement of TRPC1 channels in cardiac diseases is widely established. However, the physiological role of TRPC1 channels and the mechanisms through which they contribute to disease development are still under investigation. Our prior work suggested that TRPC1 forms Ca<sup>2+</sup> leak channels located in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) membrane. Prior studies suggested that TRPC1 channels in the cell membrane are mechanosensitive, but this was not yet investigated in cardiomyocytes or for SR localized TRPC1 channels. We applied adenoviral transfection to overexpress or suppress TRPC1 expression in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVMs). Transfections were evaluated with RT-qPCR, western blot, and fluorescent imaging. Single-molecule localization microscopy revealed high colocalization of exogenously expressed TRPC1 and the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup> ATPase (SERCA2). To test our hypothesis that TRPC1 channels contribute to mechanosensitive Ca<sup>2+</sup> SR leak, we directly measured SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>SR</sub>) using adenoviral transfection with a novel ratiometric genetically encoded SR-targeting Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor.

We apply both sensors to visualize kinetics of bacterial labile manganese pools. Biophysical studies indicate the importance of coordinated solvent and hydrophobic interactions in the sensors' selectivity. Our results establish lanmodulin as a versatile scaffold for design of selective protein-based biosensors and chelators for metals beyond the f-block.",

RZnP1 demonstrates a sensitive response to cytosolic Zn<sup>2+</sup> (<i>K</i><sub>d</sub> = 438 pM), decent brightness (quantum yield (QY) = 0.15), good in situ dynamic range (<i>F</i><sub>max</sub>/<i>F</i><sub>min</sub> = 4.0), and specificity for Zn<sup>2+</sup> over other biologically relevant metal cations.

We established an all-optical assay combining photo-OXB with a genetically encoded orexin biosensor and used it to characterize the efficiency and spatial profile of photo-OXB uncaging. Finally, we demonstrated that photo-OXB enables optical control over orexin signaling with fine temporal precision both in vitro and ex vivo.

First genetically-encoded reporters only partly overcame these limitations as the green and red fluorescent proteins (GFP/RFP) families require molecular oxygen for fluorescence. For the herein presented ratiometric and FRET-FLIM reporters dUnORS and dUnOFLS, we exploited oxygen-dependent maturation in combination with the hypoxia-tolerant fluorescent-protein UnaG. For ratiometric measurements, UnaG was fused to the orange large Stokes Shift protein CyOFP1, allowing excitation with a single light-source, while fusion of UnaG with mOrange2 allowed FRET-FLIM analysis.

Further, GPCRs are widely expressed in the brain where their agonists make up a large number of neurotransmitters and neuromodulators. Due to the importance of GPCRs in human physiology, genetically encoded sensors have been engineered to detect GPCR agonists at cellular resolution in vivo. These sensors can be placed into two main categories: those that offer real-time information on the signalling dynamics of GPCR agonists and those that integrate the GPCR agonist signal into a permanent, quantifiable mark that can be used to detect GPCR agonist localisation in a large brain area. In this review, we discuss the various designs of real-time and integration sensors, their advantages and limitations, and some in vivo applications. We also discuss the potential of using real-time and integrator sensors together to identify neuronal circuits affected by endogenous GPCR agonists and perform detailed characterisations of the spatiotemporal dynamics of GPCR agonist release in those circuits. By using these sensors together, the overall knowledge of GPCR-mediated signalling can be expanded.",

Recently, increasing evidence has revealed that cellular bioelectric signaling is critical for regulating embryonic development, regeneration, and congenital diseases. However, systematic real-time <i>in vivo</i> dynamic electrical activity monitoring of whole organisms has been limited, mainly due to the lack of a suitable model system and voltage measurement tools for <i>in vivo</i> biology. Here, we addressed this gap by utilizing a genetically stable zebrafish line, Tg (<i>ubiquitin</i>: ASAP1), and ASAP1 (Accelerated sensor of action potentials 1), a genetically encoded voltage indicator (GEVI). With light-sheet microscopy, we systematically investigated cell membrane potential (Vm) signals during different embryonic stages. We found cells of zebrafish embryos showed local membrane hyperpolarization at the cleavage furrows during the cleavage period of embryogenesis. This signal appeared before cytokinesis and fluctuated as it progressed. In contrast, whole-cell transient hyperpolarization was observed during the blastula and gastrula stages. These signals were generally limited to the superficial blastomere, but they could be detected within the deeper cells during the gastrulation period. Moreover, the zebrafish embryos exhibit tissue-level cell Vm signals during the segmentation period. Middle-aged somites had strong and dynamic Vm fluctuations starting at about the 12-somite stage. These embryonic stage-specific characteristic cellular bioelectric signals suggest that they might play a diverse role in zebrafish embryogenesis that could underlie human congenital diseases.",

        "title": "A Complete Endocannabinoid Signaling System Modulates Synaptic Transmission between Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell-Derived Neurons.",
        "abstract": "The endocannabinoid system (ECS) modulates synaptic function to regulate many aspects of neurophysiology. It adapts to environmental changes and is affected by disease. Thus, the ECS presents an important target for therapeutic development. Despite recent interest in cannabinoid-based treatments, few preclinical studies are conducted in human systems. Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) provide one possible solution to this issue. However, it is not known if these cells have a fully functional ECS. Here, we show that hiPSC-derived neuron/astrocyte cultures exhibit a complete ECS. Using Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging and a genetically encoded endocannabinoid sensor, we demonstrate that they not only respond to exogenously applied cannabinoids but also produce and metabolize endocannabinoids. Synaptically driven [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> spiking activity was inhibited (EC<sub>50</sub> = 48 ± 13 nM) by the efficacious agonist [R(+)-[2,3-dihydro-5-methyl-3-[(morpholinyl)methyl]pyrolol [1,2,3-de]-1,4-benzoxazin-yl]-(1-naphthalenyl)methanone mesylate] (Win 55,212-2) and by the endogenous ligand 2-arachidonoyl glycerol (2-AG; EC<sub>50</sub> = 2.0 ± 0.6 µm). The effects of Win 55212-2 were blocked by a CB<sub>1</sub> receptor-selective antagonist. Δ<sup>9</sup>-Tetrahydrocannabinol acted as a partial agonist, maximally inhibiting synaptic activity by 47 ± 14% (EC<sub>50</sub> = 1.4 ± 1.9 µm). Carbachol stimulated 2-AG production in a manner that was independent of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and blocked by selective inhibition of diacylglycerol lipase. 2-AG returned to basal levels via a process mediated by monoacylglycerol lipase as indicated by slowed recovery in cultures treated with 4-[<i>Bis</i>(1,3-benzodioxol-5-yl)hydroxymethyl]-1-piperidinecarboxylic acid 4-nitrophenyl ester (JZL 184). Win 55,212-2 markedly desensitized CB<sub>1</sub> receptor function following a 1-day exposure, whereas desensitization was incomplete following 7-day treatment with JZL 184. This human cell culture model is well suited for functional analysis of the ECS and as a platform for drug development. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Despite known differences between the human response to cannabinoids and that of other species, an in vitro human model demonstrating a fully functional endocannabinoid system has not been described. Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) can be obtained from skin samples and then reprogrammed into neurons for use in basic research and drug screening. Here, we show that hiPSC-derived neuronal cultures exhibit a complete endocannabinoid system suitable for mechanistic studies and drug discovery.",

        "abstract": "Recent technological advances have enabled the recording of neurons in intact circuits with a high spatial and temporal resolution, creating the need for modeling with the same precision. In particular, the development of ultra-fast two-photon microscopy combined with fluorescence-based genetically-encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup>-indicators allows capture of full-dendritic arbor and somatic responses associated with synaptic input and action potential output. The complexity of dendritic arbor structures and distributed patterns of activity over time results in the generation of incredibly rich 4D datasets that are challenging to analyze (Sakaki et al. in Frontiers in Neural Circuits 14:33, 2020). Interpreting neural activity from fluorescence-based Ca<sup>2+</sup> biosensors is challenging due to non-linear interactions between several factors influencing intracellular calcium ion concentration and its binding to sensors, including the ionic dynamics driven by diffusion, electrical gradients and voltage-gated conductances. To investigate those dynamics, we designed a model based on a Cable-like equation coupled to the Nernst-Planck equations for ionic fluxes in electrolytes. We employ this model to simulate signal propagation and ionic electrodiffusion across a dendritic arbor. Using these simulation results, we then designed an algorithm to detect synapses from Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging datasets. We finally apply this algorithm to experimental Ca<sup>2+</sup>-indicator datasets from neurons expressing jGCaMP7s (Dana et al. in Nature Methods 16:649-657, 2019), using full-dendritic arbor sampling in vivo in the Xenopus laevis optic tectum using fast random-access two-photon microscopy. Our model reproduces the dynamics of visual stimulus-evoked jGCaMP7s-mediated calcium signals observed experimentally, and the resulting algorithm allows prediction of the location of synapses across the dendritic arbor. Our study provides a way to predict synaptic activity and location on dendritic arbors, from fluorescence data in the full dendritic arbor of a neuron recorded in the intact and awake developing vertebrate brain.",

        "abstract": "Repetitively firing neurons during seizures accelerate glycolysis to meet energy demand, which leads to the accumulation of extracellular glycolytic by-product lactate. Here, we demonstrate that lactate rapidly modulates neuronal excitability in times of metabolic stress via the hydroxycarboxylic acid receptor type 1 (HCA1R) to modify seizure activity. The extracellular lactate concentration, measured by a biosensor, rose quickly during brief and prolonged seizures. In two epilepsy models, mice lacking HCA1R (lactate receptor) were more susceptible to developing seizures. Moreover, HCA1R deficient (knockout) mice developed longer and more severe seizures than wild-type littermates. Lactate perfusion decreased tonic and phasic activity of CA1 pyramidal neurons in genetically encoded calcium indicator 7 imaging experiments. HCA1R agonist 3-chloro-5-hydroxybenzoic acid (3CL-HBA) reduced the activity of CA1 neurons in HCA1R WT but not in knockout mice. In patch-clamp recordings, both lactate and 3CL-HBA hyperpolarized CA1 pyramidal neurons. HCA1R activation reduced the spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic current frequency and altered the paired-pulse ratio of evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents in HCA1R wild-type but not in knockout mice, suggesting it diminished presynaptic release of excitatory neurotransmitters. Overall, our studies demonstrate that excessive neuronal activity accelerates glycolysis to generate lactate, which translocates to the extracellular space to slow neuronal firing and inhibit excitatory transmission via HCA1R. These studies may identify novel anticonvulsant target and seizure termination mechanisms.",

This indicator exhibits a maximal fluorescence change of 200% and a <i>K</i><sub>D</sub> of ∼300 μM. The fluorescence is not affected by other monocarboxylates. The lactate indicator was not significantly affected by Ca<sup>2+</sup> at the physiological concentrations prevailing in the cytosol, endoplasmic reticulum, and extracellular space, but was affected by Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the low micromolar range. Targeting the indicator to the endoplasmic reticulum revealed for the first time sub-cellular lactate dynamics. Its improved lactate-induced fluorescence response permitted the development of a multiwell plate assay to screen for inhibitors of the monocarboxylate transporters MCTs, a pharmaceutical target for cancer and inflammation. The functionality of the indicator in living tissue was demonstrated in the brain of <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> larvae.

Imaging of cAMPFIREs in awake mice reveals tonic levels of cAMP in cortical neurons that are associated with wakefulness, modulated by opioids, and differentially regulated across subcellular compartments. Furthermore, enforced locomotion elicits neuron-specific, bidirectional cAMP dynamics. cAMPFIREs also function in Drosophila.

        "abstract": "Flavin-based fluorescent proteins (FbFPs) are a class of fluorescent reporters that undergo oxygen-independent fluorophore incorporation, which is an important advantage over green fluorescent proteins (GFPs) and mFruits. A FbFP derived from <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> (CreiLOV) is a promising platform for designing new metal sensors. Some FbFPs are intrinsically quenched by metal ions, but the question of where metals bind and how to tune metal affinity has not been addressed. We used site-directed mutagenesis of CreiLOV to probe a hypothesized copper(II) binding site that led to fluorescence quenching. Most mutations changed the fluorescence quenching level, supporting the proposed site. One key mutation introducing a second cysteine residue in place of asparagine (CreiLOV<sub>N41C</sub>) significantly altered metal affinity and selectivity, yielding a zinc sensor. The fluorescence intensity and lifetime of CreiLOV<sub>N41C</sub> were reversibly quenched by Zn<sup>2+</sup> ions with a biologically relevant affinity (apparent dissociation constant, <i>K</i><sub>d</sub>, of 1 nM). Copper quenching of CreiLOV<sub>N41C</sub> was retained but with several orders of magnitude higher affinity than CreiLOV (<i>K</i><sub>d</sub> = 0.066 fM for Cu<sup>2+</sup>, 5.4 fM for Cu<sup>+</sup>) and partial reversibility. We also show that CreiLOV<sub>N41C</sub> is an excellent intensity- and lifetime-based zinc sensor in aerobic and anaerobic live bacterial cells. Zn<sup>2+</sup>-induced fluorescence quenching is reversible over several cycles in <i>Escherichia coli</i> cell suspensions and can be imaged by fluorescence microscopy. CreiLOV<sub>N41C</sub> is a novel oxygen-independent metal sensor that significantly expands the current fluorescent protein-based toolbox of metal sensors and will allow for studies of anaerobic and low oxygen systems previously precluded by the use of oxygen-dependent GFPs.",

Recent evidence has highlighted the importance of metabolic adaptations in enabling this metastasis, leading to significant interest in evolving the arsenal of tools used to study OC metabolism. In this study, we demonstrate the capability of genetically encoded fluorescent biosensors to study OC, with a focus on 3D organoid models that better recapitulate in vivo tumor microenvironments. Plasmids encoding the metabolic biosensors HyPer, iNap, Peredox, and Perceval were transfected into 15 ovarian cancer cell lines to assay oxidative stress, NADPH/NADP+, NADH/NAD+, and ATP/ADP, respectively. Fluorescence readings were used to assay dynamic metabolic responses to omental conditioned media (OCM) and 100 μM carboplatin treatment. SKOV3 cells expressing HyPer were imaged as 2D monolayers, 3D organoids, and as in vivo metastases via an intravital omental window. We further established organoids from ascites collected from Stage III/IV OC patients with carboplatin-resistant or carboplatin-sensitive tumors (n = 8 total). These patient-derived organoids (PDOs) were engineered to express HyPer, and metabolic readings of oxidative stress were performed during treatment with 100 μM carboplatin. Exposure to OCM or carboplatin induced heterogenous metabolic changes in 15 OC cell lines, as measured using metabolic sensors. Oxidative stress of in vivo omental metastases, measured via intravital imaging of metastasizing SKOV3-HyPer cells, was more closely recapitulated by SKOV3-HyPer organoids than by 2D monolayers. Finally, carboplatin treatment of HyPer-expressing PDOs induced higher oxidative stress in organoids derived from carboplatin-resistant patients than from those derived from carboplatin-sensitive patients. Our study showed that biosensors provide a useful method of studying dynamic metabolic changes in preclinical models of OC, including 3D organoids and intravital imaging. As 3D models of OC continue to evolve, the repertoire of biosensors will likely serve as valuable tools to probe the metabolic changes of clinical importance in OC.",

In this review, we summarize the most recent methodological advances and provide a description of the involved proteins as well as the operation principle. Furthermore, we highlight their advantages and limitations in relation to studies of synaptic transmission in vitro and in vivo.

It is necessary to investigate the relationship between the projection and functional information at the single neuron level for understanding the rules of neural circuit assembly, but a gap remains due to a lack of methods to map the function to whole-brain projection. Here an approach is developed to bridge two-photon calcium imaging in vivo with high-resolution whole-brain imaging based on sparse labeling with the genetically encoded calcium indicator GCaMP6. Reliable whole-brain projections are captured by the high-definition fluorescent micro-optical sectioning tomography (HD-fMOST). A cross-modality cell matching is performed and the functional annotation of whole-brain projection at the single-neuron level (FAWPS) is obtained. Applying it to the layer 2/3 (L2/3) neurons in mouse visual cortex, the relationship is investigated between functional preferences and axonal projection features. The functional preference of projection motifs and the correlation between axonal length in MOs and neuronal orientation selectivity, suggest that projection motif-defined neurons form a functionally specific information flow, and the projection strength in specific targets relates to the information clarity. This pipeline provides a new way to understand the principle of neuronal information transmission.",

Over the past two decades there has been immense progress in the development of selenoprotein expression systems, Sec-detection methods, and genomic databases. In this review we have compiled these tools systematically, highlighting their strengths and clarifying the limitations, as a resource for future selenoprotein research.",

        "abstract": "Heme is both an essential cofactor and an abundant source of nutritional iron for the human pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis. While heme is required for M. tuberculosis survival and virulence, it is also potentially cytotoxic. Since M. tuberculosis can both synthesize and take up heme, the <i>de novo</i> synthesis of heme and its acquisition from the host may need to be coordinated in order to mitigate heme toxicity. However, the mechanisms employed by M. tuberculosis to regulate heme uptake, synthesis, and bioavailability are poorly understood. By integrating ratiometric heme sensors with mycobacterial genetics, cell biology, and biochemistry, we determined that <i>de novo</i>-synthesized heme is more bioavailable than exogenously scavenged heme, and heme availability signals the downregulation of heme biosynthetic enzyme gene expression. Ablation of heme synthesis does not result in the upregulation of known heme import proteins. Moreover, we found that <i>de novo</i> heme synthesis is critical for survival from macrophage assault. Altogether, our data suggest that mycobacteria utilize heme from endogenous and exogenous sources differently and that targeting heme synthesis may be an effective therapeutic strategy to treat mycobacterial infections. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Mycobacterium tuberculosis infects ~25% of the world's population and causes tuberculosis (TB), the second leading cause of death from infectious disease. Heme is an essential metabolite for M. tuberculosis, and targeting the unique heme biosynthetic pathway of M. tuberculosis could serve as an effective therapeutic strategy. However, since M. tuberculosis can both synthesize and scavenge heme, it was unclear if inhibiting heme synthesis alone could serve as a viable approach to suppress M. tuberculosis growth and virulence. The importance of this work lies in the development and application of genetically encoded fluorescent heme sensors to probe bioavailable heme in M. tuberculosis and the discovery that endogenously synthesized heme is more bioavailable than exogenously scavenged heme. Moreover, it was found that heme synthesis protected M. tuberculosis from macrophage killing, and bioavailable heme in M. tuberculosis is diminished during macrophage infection. Altogether, these findings suggest that targeting M. tuberculosis heme synthesis is an effective approach to combat M. tuberculosis infections.",

In this work, we developed genetically encoded FRET biosensors based on the chemigenetic SNAP and HaloTag domains combined with matching organic fluorophores. We found that the resulting constructs can display comparable responses, kinetics, and reversibility compared to their fluorescent protein-based ancestors, but with the added advantage of spectral versatility, including the availability of red-shifted dye pairs. However, we also find that the introduction of these tags can alter the sensor readout, showing that careful validation is required before applying such constructs in practice.

In contrast, some bacteria, such as <i>Escherichia coli MG1655</i>, can selectively proliferate in a hypoxic environment inside of a tumor for several days, which highlights the potential for the development of a genetically encoded multimodal imaging probe to monitor the progress of the tumor. Here, we developed bimodal imaging tumor-homing bacteria (GVs-miRFP680 MG1655) that allow both optical and acoustic imaging in tumor-bearing mice. An in vivo optical image system and a Vevo 2100 imaging system were applied to detect different imaging properties of the engineered bacteria in vivo. Our results show that the GVs-miRFP680 MG1655 bacteria can effectively integrate the advantages of low tissue absorbance from near-infrared fluorescent proteins and non-invasiveness from gas vesicles. We successfully developed GVs-miRFP680 MG1655 bacteria, which have both acoustic and optical imaging abilities in vitro and in vivo. The acoustic signal can last for up to 25 min, while the near-infrared fluorescence signal can last for up to 96 h.

Analyses of NIN-NLP7 chimeras and nitrate binding revealed that NLP7 is derepressed upon nitrate perception via its amino terminus. A genetically encoded fluorescent split biosensor, mCitrine-NLP7, enabled visualization of single-cell nitrate dynamics in planta. The nitrate sensor domain of NLP7 resembles the bacterial nitrate sensor NreA.

        "abstract": "Engineered probiotic bacteria have been proposed as a next-generation strategy for noninvasively detecting biomarkers in the gastrointestinal tract and interrogating the gut-brain axis. A major challenge impeding the implementation of this strategy has been the difficulty to engineer the necessary whole-cell biosensors. Creation of transcription factor-based biosensors in a clinically-relevant strain often requires significant tuning of the genetic parts and gene expression to achieve the dynamic range and sensitivity required. Here, we propose an approach to efficiently engineer transcription-factor based metabolite biosensors that uses a design prototyping construct to quickly assay the gene expression design space and identify an optimal genetic design. We demonstrate this approach using the probiotic bacterium <i>Escherichia coli</i> Nissle 1917 (EcN) and two neuroactive gut metabolites: the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and the short-chain fatty acid propionate. The EcN propionate sensor, utilizing the PrpR transcriptional activator from <i>E. coli</i>, has a large 59-fold dynamic range and >500-fold increased sensitivity that matches biologically-relevant concentrations<i>.</i> Our EcN GABA biosensor uses the GabR transcriptional repressor from <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> and a synthetic GabR-regulated promoter created in this study. This work reports the first known synthetic microbial whole-cell biosensor for GABA, which has an observed 138-fold activation in EcN at biologically-relevant concentrations. Using this rapid design prototyping approach, we engineer highly functional biosensors for specified <i>in vivo</i> metabolite concentrations that achieve a large dynamic range and high output promoter activity upon activation. This strategy may be broadly useful for accelerating the engineering of metabolite biosensors for living diagnostics and therapeutics.",

First, using photoacoustic microscopy, we show that depth-resolved GCaMP signals can be monitored in vivo from a fly brain in response to odor stimulation without depth scanning and even with the cuticle intact. In vivo monitoring of GCaMP signals was also demonstrated in mouse brains. Next, using photoacoustic computed tomography, we imaged neural responses of a mouse brain slice at depths beyond the optical diffusion limit. We provide the first unambiguous demonstration that multiscale PAT can be used to record neural activities in transgenic flies and mice with select neurons expressing GCaMP. Our results indicate that the combination of multiscale PAT and fluorescent neural activity indicators provides a methodology for imaging targeted neurons at various scales.",

        "abstract": "Apoptosis and necrosis are the two sides of the cell death penumbra. Apoptosis is a well-studied model of cell death wherein the cell destroys itself employing a predefined form of active signaling without the release of soluble cytoplasmic contents to the external environment. Compared to apoptosis, necrosis is a nonspecific form of sudden cell death in response to an invasive external stimulus which in turn is devoid of active programmed intracellular signaling leading to the sudden release of the soluble cellular contents consequent to the rupture of the cell membrane. This fundamental difference between apoptosis and necrosis made us believe that the former is the safe form of cell death and the latter is an undesirable one which often elicits an inflammatory response to the adjacent cells. Recent studies have shown that necrosis also involves a few defined cellular and complex biochemical events similar to apoptosis rendering it difficult to distinguish these two events at the single-cell level using the currently used popular assays.Here we provide a newly described detailed methodology encompassing cell system development along with a multiparametric flow cytometry-based approach to discriminate apoptotic cells from necrotic cells using a stable cell line expressing genetically encoded probe for detecting caspase activation and DsRed targeted at the mitochondria.",

However, most existing fluorescent protein-based BiFC (FP-BiFC) assays still suffer from relatively low specificity or imaging signal-to-noise (S/N) ratios. Thus, developing high S/N ratio BiFC probes, especially in the widely used bright green-yellow region of the spectrum is very meaningful. In addition, synthetic engineering of BiFC probes which can be readily used for multiplexing imaging is also highly valuable for uncovering more or new layers of information on PPIs. In this report, we developed a bright stable green fluorescent protein Springgreen-M based on our previously evolved fast reversible photoswitching fluorescent protein (RSFP) GMars-T. We then established a novel BiFC assay based on Springgreen-M for imaging PPIs in live cells with high specificity. Combined with the same lineage, BiFC assays readily developed from photoconvertible fluorescent protein mMaple3 or reversibly photoswitchable fluorescent protein GMars-T, high specificity multiplexing imaging of PPIs could also be realized in the same live cell. Thus, our newly developed Springgreen-M and Springgreen-M-based BiFC probes will meet the urgent need for high-specificity BiFC detection, flexible visualization and screening of PPIs in live cells.",

        "abstract": "Wide-field calcium imaging from the mouse's neocortex allows one to observe cortex-wide neural activity related to various brain functions. On the other hand, two-photon imaging can resolve the activity of local neural circuits at the single-cell level. It is critical to make a large cranial window to perform multiple-scale analysis using both imaging techniques in the same mouse. To achieve this, one must remove a large section of the skull and cover the exposed cortical surface with transparent materials. Previously, glass skulls and polymer-based cranial windows have been developed for this purpose, but these materials are not easily fabricated. The present protocol describes a simple method for making a large cranial window consisting of commercially available polyvinylidene chloride (PVDC) wrapping film, a transparent silicone plug, and a cover glass. For imaging the dorsal surface of an entire hemisphere, the window size was approximately 6 x 3 mm<sup>2</sup>. Severe brain vibrations were not observed regardless of such a large window. Importantly, the condition of the brain surface did not deteriorate for more than one month. Wide-field imaging of a mouse expressing a genetically-encoded calcium indicator (GECI), GCaMP6f, specifically in astrocytes, revealed synchronized responses in a few millimeters. Two-photon imaging of the same mouse showed prominent calcium responses in individual astrocytes over several seconds. Furthermore, a thin layer of an adeno-associated virus was applied to the PVDC film and successfully expressed GECI in cortical neurons over the cranial window. This technique is reliable and cost-effective for making a large cranial window and facilitates the investigation of the neural and glial dynamics and their interactions during behavior at the macroscopic and microscopic levels.",

It has been used for years to study odorant-induced responses in insects (i.e., honeybees, <i>Drosophila</i>, and moths) and was recently introduced into mosquitoes. Traditionally, calcium imaging in mosquitoes was performed using nonspecific calcium indicator dyes to examine neuronal responses in whole insect brain regions, but the development of genetically encoded calcium indicators (GECIs) has facilitated the ability to perform functional calcium imaging on specific tissues. For example, by specifically expressing a GECI in olfactory neurons, the odor-induced responses of these neurons in peripheral organs can be examined. Calcium imaging of mosquito antennae further provides an advantageous method for simultaneously visualizing the activity of several antennal neurons in a single experiment. In this protocol, we describe a calcium imaging method to study odor-evoked responses in <i>Anopheles coluzzii</i> antennae expressing the calcium indicator GCaMP6f. This method requires imaging equipment (compound microscope, light sources, and camera), an odorant delivery system, and image acquisition software. The mosquito preparation is straightforward but requires practice to minimize mosquito movement during imaging.

A somewhat generalizable approach for this challenge is demonstrated here by evolving a naturally occurring chemically induced heterodimer into a genetically encoded sensor for herbicides. The interaction between PYRABACTIN-RESISTANT-like receptors and type-2C protein phosphatases is induced by abscisic acid─a small-molecule hormone in plants. We considered abscisic acid receptors as a potential scaffold for the development of biosensors because of past successes in their engineering, a structurally defined ligand cavity and the availability of large-scale assays for their activation. A panel of 475 receptor variants, mutated at ligand-proximal residues, was screened for activation by 37 herbicides from several classes. Twelve compounds activated at least one member of the mutant panel. To facilitate the subsequent improvement of herbicide receptors through directed evolution, we engineered a yeast two-hybrid platform optimized for sequential positive and negative selection using fluorescence-activated cell sorting. By utilizing this system, we were able to isolate receptors with low nanomolar sensitivity and a broad dynamic range in sensing a ubiquitous group of chloroacetamide herbicides. Aside from its possible applicative value, this work lays down conceptual groundwork and provides infrastructure for the future development of biosensors through directed evolution.",

Recent studies have suggested that activation of P2-purinergic receptors (P2Rs) may be involved in neuron-satellite glial cell (SGC) interactions in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG), but the details remain unclear. In DRG, P2X7R is selectively expressed in SGCs, which closely surround neurons, and is highly sensitive to 3'-O-(4-Benzoyl) benzoyl-ATP (BzATP). Using calcium imaging in intact mice to survey a large number of DRG neurons and SGCs, we examined how intra-ganglionic purinergic signaling initiated by BzATP affects neuronal activities in vivo. We developed <i>GFAP</i>-GCaMP6s and <i>Pirt</i>-GCaMP6s mice to express the genetically encoded calcium indicator GGCaM6s in SGCs and DRG neurons, respectively. The application of BzATP to the ganglion induced concentration-dependent activation of SGCs in <i>GFAP</i>-GCaMP6s mice. In <i>Pirt</i>-GCaMP6s mice, BzATP initially activated more large-size neurons than small-size ones. Both glial and neuronal responses to BzATP were blocked by A438079, a P2X7R-selective antagonist. Moreover, blockers to pannexin1 channels (probenecid) and P2X3R (A317491) also reduced the actions of BzATP, suggesting that P2X7R stimulation may induce the opening of pannexin1 channels, leading to paracrine ATP release, which could further excite neurons by acting on P2X3Rs. Importantly, BzATP increased the responses of small-size DRG neurons and wide-dynamic range spinal neurons to subsequent peripheral stimuli. Our findings suggest that intra-ganglionic purinergic signaling initiated by P2X7R activation could trigger SGC-neuron interaction in vivo and increase DRG neuron excitability.",

This work is devoted to the proof of principle of using photoconvertible proteins to measure caspase enzymatic activity in a single live cell. The advantage of this approach is that partial photoconversion of the FP makes FCS measurements possible when studying enzymatic reactions. To investigate the process, in vivo we used HeLa cell line expressing the engineered FRET sensor, SAASoti-23-KFP. This FRET sensor has a cleavable (DEVD) sequence in the linker between two FPs for the detection of one of the key enzymes of apoptosis, caspase-3. Caspase-3 activity was detected by registering the increase in the fluorescent lifetimes of the sensor, whereas the diffusion coefficient of SAASoti decreased. This can be explained by an increase in the total cell viscosity during apoptosis. We can suppose that in the moment of detectible caspase-3 activity, cell structure already has crucial changes in viscosity.",

The first sensor was based on the Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) between the red fluorescent protein mScarlet as a donor and the biliverdin-binding near-infrared fluorescent protein miRFP670 as an acceptor. A linker with the PLpro recognition site LKGG in between made this FRET pair sensitive to PLpro cleavage. Upon the co-expression of mScarlet-LKGG-miRFP670 and PLpro in HeLa cells, we observed a gradual increase in the donor fluorescence intensity of about 1.5-fold. In the second sensor, both PLpro and its target-green mNeonGreen and red mScarletI fluorescent proteins separated by an LKGG-containing linker-were attached to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane.

        "abstract": "Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) is a canonical intracellular messenger playing diverse roles in cell functions. In neurons, cAMP promotes axonal growth during early development, and mediates sensory transduction and synaptic plasticity after maturation. The molecular cascades of cAMP are well documented, but its spatiotemporal profiles associated with neuronal functions remain hidden. Hence, we developed a genetically encoded cAMP indicator based on a bacterial cAMP-binding protein. This indicator \"gCarvi\" monitors [cAMP]<sub>i</sub> at 0.2 to 20 µM with a subsecond time resolution and a high specificity over cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). gCarvi can be converted to a ratiometric probe for [cAMP]<sub>i</sub> quantification and its expression can be specifically targeted to various subcellular compartments. Monomeric gCarvi also enables simultaneous multisignal monitoring in combination with other indicators. As a proof of concept, simultaneous cAMP/Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging in hippocampal neurons revealed a tight linkage of cAMP to Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals. In cerebellar presynaptic boutons, forskolin induced nonuniform cAMP elevations among boutons, which positively correlated with subsequent increases in the size of the recycling pool of synaptic vesicles assayed using FM dye. Thus, the cAMP domain in presynaptic boutons is an important determinant of the synaptic strength.",

        "abstract": "The baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS) has become an important platform for the expression of recombinant proteins and is especially useful for the production of large protein complexes such as virus-like particles (VLPs). An important application for VLPs is their use as vehicles for targeted delivery of drugs or toxins which requires the development of methods for efficient loading with the intended cargo. Our research intends to employ the BEVS for the production of VLPs for the delivery of insecticidal dsRNA molecules to targeted insect pests (as \"dsRNA-VLPs\"). A convenient strategy would be the co-expression of long dsRNAs with viral capsid proteins and their simultaneous encapsulation during VLP assembly but the capacity of the BEVS for the production of long dsRNA has not been assessed so far. In this study, the efficiency of production of long RNA hairpins targeting the <i>luciferase</i> gene (\"dsLuc\") by the <i>polyhedrin</i> promoter during baculovirus infection was evaluated. However, RNAi reporter assays could not detect significant amounts of dsLuc in Hi5 cells infected with recombinant baculovirus, even in the presence of co-expressed dsRNA-binding protein B2-GFP or the employment of the MS2-MCP system. Nevertheless, dot blot analyses using anti-dsRNA antibody revealed that baculovirus-mediated expression of B2-GFP resulted in significant increases in dsRNA levels in infected cells that may correspond to hybridized complementary viral transcripts. Using B2-GFP as a genetically encoded sensor, dsRNA foci were detected in the nuclei that partially co-localized with DAPI staining, consistent with their localization at the virogenic stroma. Co-localization experiments with the baculovirus proteins vp39, Ac93, ODV-E25 and gp64 indicated limited overlap between B2-GFP and the ring zone compartment where assembly of nucleocapsids and virions occurs. Stability experiments showed that exogenous dsRNA is resistant to degradation in extracts of non-infected and infected Hi5 cells and it is proposed that strong unwinding activity at the virogenic stroma in the infected nuclei may neutralize the annealing of complementary RNA strands and block the production of long dsRNAs. Because the strong stability of exogenous dsRNA, transfection can be explored as an alternative method for delivery of cargo for dsRNA-VLPs during their assembly in baculovirus-infected Hi5 cells.",

Among such biosensors, genetically encoded fluorescent sensor proteins are attractive tools owing to their subcellular localization advantage and high biocompatibility. However, the limited fluorescent properties of these proteins, such as their insufficient quantum yield and dynamic range, restrict their practical use. In this study, we developed an expression-screening-directed evolution system and used it to improve ZapCY1, a genetically encoded fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) sensor. After four rounds of directed evolution, the FRET dynamic range of the modified sensor (designated ZapTV-EH) was increased by 1.5-1.7-fold. With its enhanced signal-to-noise ratio and ability to detect a wide Zn<sup>2+</sup> concentration range, ZapTV-EH proves to be a better visualization tool for monitoring Zn<sup>2+</sup> at the subcellular level.

        "abstract": "Hepatocytes were the first cell type for which oscillations of cytoplasmic calcium levels in response to hormones were described. Since then, investigation of calcium dynamics in liver explants and culture has greatly increased our understanding of calcium signaling. A bottleneck, however, exists in observing calcium dynamics in a noninvasive manner because of the optical inaccessibility of the mammalian liver. Here, we aimed to take advantage of the transparency of the zebrafish larvae to image hepatocyte calcium dynamics in vivo at cellular resolution. We developed a transgenic model expressing a calcium sensor, GCaMP6s, specifically in zebrafish hepatocytes. Using this, we provide a quantitative assessment of intracellular calcium dynamics during multiple contexts, including growth, feeding, ethanol-induced stress, and cell ablation. Specifically, we show that synchronized calcium oscillations are present in vivo , which are lost upon starvation. Starvation induces lipid accumulation in the liver. Feeding recommences calcium waves in the liver, but in a spatially restricted manner, as well as resolves starvation-induced hepatic steatosis. By using a genetically encoded scavenger for calcium, we show that dampening of calcium signaling accelerates the accumulation of starvation-related lipid droplets in the liver. Furthermore, ethanol treatment, as well as cell ablation, induces calcium flux, but with different dynamics. The former causes asynchronous calcium oscillations, whereas the latter leads to a single calcium spike. We demonstrate the presence of oscillations, waves, and spikes in vivo . Calcium waves are present in response to nutrition and negatively regulate starvation-induced accumulation of lipid droplets.",

Detecting synaptic dysfunctions at the earliest stage of AD would be desirable in both clinic and research settings. Population voltage imaging allows monitoring of synaptic depolarizations, to which calcium imaging is relatively blind. We developed an AD mouse model (APPswe/PS1dE9 background) expressing a genetically-encoded voltage indicator (GEVI) in the neocortex. GEVI was restricted to the excitatory pyramidal neurons (unlike the voltage-sensitive dyes). Expression of GEVI did not disrupt AD model formation of amyloid plaques. GEVI expression was stable in both AD model mice and Control (healthy) littermates (CTRL) over 247 days postnatal. Brain slices were stimulated in layer 2/3. From the evoked voltage waveforms, we extracted several parameters for comparison AD versus CTRL. Some parameters (e.g., temporal summation, refractoriness, and peak latency) were weak predictors, while other parameters (e.g., signal amplitude, attenuation with distance, and duration (half-width) of the evoked transients) were stronger predictors of the AD condition. Around postnatal age 150 days (P150) and especially at P200, synaptically-evoked voltage signals in brain slices were weaker in the AD groups versus the age- and sex-matched CTRL groups, suggesting an AD-mediated synaptic weakening that coincides with the accumulation of plaques. However, at the youngest ages examined, P40 and P80, the AD groups showed differentially stronger signals, suggesting \"hyperexcitability\" prior to the formation of plaques. Our results indicate bidirectional alterations in cortical physiology in AD model mice; occurring both prior (P40-80), and after (P150-200) the amyloid deposition.",

This activity has been studied using electrophysiological approaches, as high temporal resolution is required to recognize SWRs in the neuronal signals. However, it has been difficult to analyze the individual contribution of neurons to task-specific SWRs, because it is hard to track neurons across a long time with electrophysiological recording. In this study, we recorded local field potential (LFP) signals in the hippocampal CA1 of freely behaving mice and simultaneously imaged calcium signals in contralateral CA1 to leverage the advantages of both electrophysiological and imaging approaches. We manufactured a custom-designed microdrive array and targeted tetrodes to the left hippocampus CA1 for LFP recording and applied electrical stimulation in the ventral hippocampal commissure (VHC) for closed-loop disruption of SWRs. Neuronal population imaging in the right hippocampal CA1 was performed using a miniature fluorescent microscope (Miniscope) and a genetically encoded calcium indicator. As SWRs show highly synchronized bilateral occurrence, calcium signals of SWR-participating neurons could be identified and tracked in spontaneous or SWR-disrupted conditions. Using this approach, we identified a subpopulation of CA1 neurons showing synchronous calcium elevation to SWRs. Our results showed that SWR-related calcium transients are more disrupted by electrical stimulation than non-SWRrelated calcium transients, validating the capability of the system to detect and disrupt SWRs. Our dual recording method can be used to uncover the dynamic participation of individual neurons in SWRs and replay over extended time windows.",

Cisplatin is a commonly used platinum-based chemotherapeutic drug known to cause CIPN, possibly by causing oxidative stress damage to primary sensory neurons. Metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) are widely hypothesized to be involved in pain processing and pain mitigation. Meclizine is an H1 histamine receptor antagonist known to have neuroprotective effects, including an anti-oxidative effect. Here, we used a mouse model of cisplatin-induced CIPN using male and female mice to test agonists of mGluR8 and Group II mGluR as well as meclizine as interventions to reduce cisplatin-induced pain. We performed behavioral pain tests, and we imaged Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity of the large population of dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons <i>in vivo</i> For the latter, we used a genetically-encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator, Pirt-GCaMP3, which enabled us to monitor different drug interventions at the level of the intact DRG neuronal ensemble. We found that CIPN increased spontaneous Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity in DRG neurons, increased number of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients, and increased hyper-responses to mechanical, thermal, and chemical stimuli. We found that mechanical and thermal pain caused by CIPN was significantly attenuated by the mGluR8 agonist, (S)-3,4-DCPG, the Group II mGluR agonist, LY379268, and the H1 histamine receptor antagonist, meclizine. DRG neuronal Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity elevated by CIPN was attenuated by LY379268 and meclizine, but not by (S)-3,4-DCPG. Furthermore, meclizine and LY379268 attenuated cisplatin-induced weight loss. These results suggest that Group II mGluR agonist, mGluR8 agonist, and meclizine are promising candidates as new treatment options for CIPN, and studies of their mechanisms are warranted.<b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a painful condition that affects most chemotherapy patients and persists several months or longer after treatment ends. Research on CIPN mechanism is extensive but has produced only few clinically useful treatments. Using <i>in vivo</i> GCaMP Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging in live animals over 1800 neurons/dorsal root ganglia (DRG) at once, we have characterized the effects of the chemotherapeutic drug, cisplatin and three treatments that decrease CIPN pain. Cisplatin increases sensory neuronal Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity and develops various sensitization. Metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) agonist, LY379268 or the H1 histamine receptor antagonist, meclizine decreases cisplatin's effects on neuronal Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity and reduces pain hypersensitivity. Our results and experiments provide insights into cellular effects of cisplatin and drugs preventing CIPN pain.",

While interactors for the class I interaction, which involves binding of a SUMO-interacting motif (SIM) to a hydrophobic groove in SUMO-1 and SUMO-2/3, are widely abundant, only a couple of examples have been reported for the other two types of interactions. Class II binding is conveyed by the E67 loop region on SUMO-1. Many previous studies to identify SUMO binders using pull-down or microarray approaches did not strategize on the SUMO binding mode. Identification of SUMO binding partners is further complicated due to the typically transient and low affinity interactions with the modifier. Here we aimed to identify SUMO-1 binders selectively enriched for class II binding. Using a genetically encoded photo-crosslinker approach, we have designed SUMO-1 probes to covalently capture class II SUMO-1 interactors by strategically positioning the photo-crosslinking moiety on the SUMO-1 surface. The probes were validated using known class II and class I binding partners. We utilized the probe with p-benzoyl-phenylalanine (BzF, also termed BpF or Bpa) at the position of Gln69 to identify binding proteins from mammalian cell extracts using mass spectrometry. By comparison with results obtained with a similarly designed SUMO-1 probe to target SIM-mediated binders of the class I type, we identified 192 and 96 proteins specifically enriched by either probe, respectively. The implicated preferential class I or class II binding modes of these proteins will further contribute to unveiling the complex interplay of SUMO-1-mediated interactions.",

        "abstract": "Cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP) is an important intracellular second messenger molecule downstream of many G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Fluorescence imaging with bright and sensitive cAMP indicators allows not only dissecting the spatiotemporal dynamics of intracellular cAMP, but also high-content screening of compounds against GPCRs. We previously reported the high-performance circularly permuted GFP (cpGFP)-based cAMP indicator G-Flamp1. Here, we developed improved G-Flamp1 variants G-Flamp2 and G-Flamp2b. Compared to G-Flamp1, G-Flamp2 exhibited increased baseline fluorescence (1.6-fold) and larger fluorescence change (ΔF/F<sub>0</sub>) (1,300% vs. 1,100%) in HEK293T cells, while G-Flamp2b showed increased baseline fluorescence (3.1-fold) and smaller ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> (400% vs. 1,100%). Furthermore, live cell imaging of mitochondrial matrix-targeted G-Flamp2 confirmed cytosolic cAMP was able to enter the mitochondrial matrix. G-Flamp2 imaging also showed that adipose tissue extract activated the Gi protein-coupled orphan GPCR GPR50 in HEK293T cells. Taken together, our results showed that the high-performance of G-Flamp2 would facilitate sensitive intracellular cAMP imaging and activity measurement of compounds targeting GPCR-cAMP signaling pathway during early drug development.",

Macrophages use multiple mechanisms to detect and engulf apoptotic cells, but the signaling pathways that regulate the digestion of the apoptotic cell cargo, such as the dynamic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals, are poorly understood. Using an siRNA screen, we identify TRPM7 as a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-conducting ion channel essential for phagosome maturation during efferocytosis. Trpm7-targeted macrophages fail to fully acidify or digest their phagosomal cargo in the absence of TRPM7.

Using mice expressing a genetically-encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor, we observe that phagosome maturation requires peri-phagosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup>-signals dependent on TRPM7.

Arrays of reconnectable implantable fiber probes combined with advanced optogenetic fluorescent protein sensors are shown to enable a quantitative multisite time-resolved study of oxidative-stress and acidosis buildup dynamics as the key markers, correlates and possible drivers of ischemic stroke. The fiber probes designed for this work provide a wavelength-multiplex forward-propagation channel for a spatially localized, dual-pathway excitation of genetically encoded fluorescence-protein sensors along with a back-propagation channel for the fluorescence return from optically driven fluorescence sensors. We show that the spectral analysis of the fiber-probe-collected fluorescence return provides means for a high-fidelity autofluorescence background subtraction, thus enhancing the sensitivity of real-time detection of stroke-induced transients and significantly reducing measurement uncertainties in in vivo acute-stroke studies as inherently statistical experiments operating with outcomes of multiply repeated measurements on large populations of individually variable animal stroke models.",

        "abstract": "The acute motor axonal variant of Guillain-Barré syndrome is associated with the attack of motor axons by anti-ganglioside antibodies which activate complement on the axonal plasma membrane. Animal models have indirectly implicated complement pore-mediated calcium influx as a trigger of axonal damage, through the activation of the protease calpain. However, this calcium influx has never been imaged directly. Herein we describe a method to detect changes in intra-axonal calcium in an ex vivo mouse model of axonal Guillain-Barré syndrome and describe the influence of calcium on axonal injury and the effects of calpain inhibition on axonal outcome. Using ex vivo nerve-muscle explants from Thy1-TNXXL mice which axonally express a genetically encoded calcium indicator, we studied the effect of the binding and activation of complement by an anti-GD1b ganglioside antibody which targets the motor axon. Using live multiphoton imaging, we found that a wave of calcium influx extends retrogradely from the motor nerve terminal as far back as the large bundles within the muscle explant. Despite terminal complement pores being detectable only at the motor nerve terminal and, to a lesser degree, the most distal node of Ranvier, disruption of axonal proteins occurred at more proximal sites implicating the intra-axonal calcium wave. Morphological analysis indicated two different types of calcium-induced changes: acutely, distal axons showed swelling and breakdown at sites where complement pores were present. Distally, in areas of raised calcium which lacked detectable complement pores, axons developed a spindly, vacuolated appearance suggestive of early signs of degeneration. All morphological changes were prevented with treatment with a calpain inhibitor. This is the first investigation of axonal calcium dynamics in a mouse model of Guillain-Barré syndrome and demonstrates the proximal reach of calcium influx following an injury which is confined to the most distal parts of the motor axon. We also demonstrate that calpain inhibition remains a promising candidate for both acute and sub-acute consequences of calcium-induced calpain activation.",

        "abstract": "Enhancing the thermostability of enzymes without impacting their catalytic function represents an important yet challenging goal in protein engineering and biocatalysis. We recently introduced a novel method for enzyme thermostabilization that relies on the computationally guided installation of genetically encoded thioether \"staples\" into a protein via cysteine alkylation with the noncanonical amino acid <i>O</i>-2-bromoethyl tyrosine (O2beY). Here, we demonstrate the functionality of an expanded set of electrophilic amino acids featuring chloroacetamido, acrylamido, and vinylsulfonamido side-chain groups for protein stapling using this strategy. Using a myoglobin-based cyclopropanase as a model enzyme, our studies show that covalent stapling with <i>p</i>-chloroacetamido-phenylalanine (pCaaF) provides higher stapling efficiency and enhanced stability (thermodynamic and kinetic) compared to the other stapled variants and the parent protein. Interestingly, molecular simulations of conformational flexibility of the cross-links show that the pCaaF staple allows fewer energetically feasible conformers than the other staples, and this property may be a broader indicator of stability enhancement. Using this strategy, pCaaF-stapled variants with significantly enhanced stability against thermal denaturation (Δ<i>T</i><sub>m</sub>' = +27 °C) and temperature-induced heme loss (Δ<i>T</i><sub>50</sub> = +30 °C) were obtained while maintaining high levels of catalytic activity and stereoselectivity. Crystallographic analyses of singly and doubly stapled variants provide key insights into the structural basis for stabilization, which includes both direct interactions of the staples with protein residues and indirect interactions through adjacent residues involved in heme binding. This work expands the toolbox of protein stapling strategies available for protein stabilization.",

How this dynamic is orchestrated in time and space is poorly understood. Here, we apply a genetically encoded sensor for histone exchange to follow the time-resolved histone H3 exchange profile in budding yeast cells undergoing slow synchronous replication in nucleotide-limiting conditions. We find that new histones are incorporated not only behind, but also ahead of the replication fork. We provide evidence that Rtt109, the S-phase-induced acetyltransferase, stabilizes nucleosomes behind the fork but promotes H3 replacement ahead of the fork. Increased replacement ahead of the fork is independent of the primary Rtt109 acetylation target H3K56 and rather results from Vps75-dependent Rtt109 activity toward the H3 N terminus. Our results suggest that, at least under nucleotide-limiting conditions, selective incorporation of differentially modified H3s behind and ahead of the replication fork results in opposing effects on histone exchange, likely reflecting the distinct challenges for genome stability at these different regions.",

Layer 4 spiny stellate cells form much smaller barrels and their dendritic fields are more focalized and less complex compared to controls, while layer 3 pyramidal cells did not show notable differences.

To evaluate the potency of new gene therapy vectors in a preclinical context, it is common to use animal models, such as gene-deficient or mutant animal models of a given human disease, and then assess vision restoration with functional or behavioral assays. While such animal models are invaluable to the preclinical testing process, they cannot be readily used as batch release tests during manufacturing or to validate biological activity at later stages of development. There is therefore a need for rapid and reliable in vitro models that can determine whether therapeutic vectors have delivered their cargo gene, and more importantly, whether this has resulted in the intended biological activity. Given our previous experience, we chose CNGA3-linked achromatopsia to develop a cell-based system to verify biological activity of AAV vectors designed to deliver a healthy <i>CNGA3</i> gene copy into human cone photoreceptors. Our system is based on an immortalized cell line with high susceptibility to AAV transduction, i.e., HeLa cells, which we engineered to express a fungal rhodopsin guanylyl cyclase (RhGC) from <i>Blastocladiella emersonii</i> and a sensitive genetically encoded calcium indicator (GECI) under the control of a tetracycline operator. Using this system, we were able to confirm and quantify the function of the ion channel encoded by AAV/CNGA3 and differentiate between AAV vector potencies with a simple fluorometric assay. Finally, we show that this approach can be readily adapted for the assessment of phosphodiesterase function.",

In particular, poor understanding of Ca2+ dynamics between sperm subcellular compartments and regulation of membrane fusion mechanisms have led to competing models of AE. Here, we developed a transgenic mouse expressing an Acrosome-targeted Sensor for Exocytosis (AcroSensE) to investigate the spatial and temporal Ca2+ dynamics in AE in live sperm. AcroSensE combines a genetically encoded Ca2+ indicator (GCaMP) fused with an mCherry indicator to spatiotemporally resolve acrosomal Ca2+ rise (ACR) and membrane fusion events, enabling real-time study of AE. We found that ACR is dependent on extracellular Ca2+ and that ACR precedes AE. In addition, we show that there are intermediate steps in ACR and that AE correlates better with the ACR rate rather than absolute Ca2+ amount. Finally, we demonstrate that ACR and membrane fusion progression kinetics and spatial patterns differ with different stimuli and that sites of initiation of ACR and sites of membrane fusion do not always correspond. These findings support a model involving functionally redundant pathways that enable a highly regulated, multistep AE in heterogeneous sperm populations, unlike the previously proposed \"acrosome reaction\" model.",

In this study, we evaluated the suitability of the lactate receptor, hydroxycarboxylic acid receptor 1 (HCAR1, formerly named GPR81), as a basis for the development of a genetically encoded fluorescent lactate biosensor. We used a biosensor strategy that was successfully applied to molecules such as dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine, based on their respective G-protein-coupled receptors. In this study, a set of intensiometric sensors was constructed and expressed in living cells. They showed selective expression at the plasma membrane and responded to physiological concentrations of lactate. However, these sensors lost the original ability of HCAR1 to selectively respond to lactate versus other related small carboxylic acid molecules.

In this study, we present an investigation on the correlations between the production of ROS, the redox ratio FAD/NAD(P)H, the proportions of the reduced nicotinamide cofactors NADH and NADPH, and caspase-3 activity in cancer cells at the level of individual cells. Two-photon excitation fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) was applied to monitor simultaneously apoptosis using the genetically encoded sensor of caspase-3, mKate2-DEVD-iRFP, and the autofluorescence of redox cofactors in colorectal cancer cells upon stimulation of apoptosis with staurosporine, cisplatin or hydrogen peroxide. We found that, irrespective of the apoptotic stimulus used, ROS accumulation correlated well with both the elevated pool of mitochondrial, enzyme-bound NADH and caspase-3 activation. Meanwhile, a shift in the contribution of bound NADH could develop independently of the apoptosis, and this was observed in the case of cisplatin. An increase in the proportion of bound NADPH was detected only in staurosporine-treated cells, this likely being associated with a high level of ROS production and their resulting detoxification. The results of the study favor the discovery of new therapeutic strategies based on manipulation of the cellular redox balance, which could help improve the anti-tumor activity of drugs and overcome apoptotic resistance.",

        "abstract": "Genetically encoded FRET sensors for revealing local concentrations of second messengers in living cells have enormously contributed to our understanding of physiological and pathological processes. However, the development of sensors remains an intricate process. Using simulation techniques, we recently introduced a new architecture to measure intracellular concentrations of cAMP named CUTie, which works as a FRET tag for arbitrary targeting domains. Although our method showed quasi-quantitative predictive power in the design of cAMP and cGMP sensors, it remains intricate and requires specific computational skills. Here, we provide a simplified computer-aided protocol to design tailor-made CUTie sensors based on arbitrary cyclic nucleotide-binding domains. As a proof of concept, we applied this method to construct a new CUTie sensor with a significantly higher cAMP sensitivity (EC50 = 460 nM).This simple protocol, which integrates our previous experience, only requires free web servers and can be straightforwardly used to create cAMP sensors adapted to the physicochemical characteristics of known cyclic nucleotide-binding domains.",

In this study, we use such a biosensor designed to monitor cytosolic H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> levels in the budding yeast <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> during continuous cultivation and in the absence of a fluorescence microscope. The fluorescent biosensor contains a peroxiredoxin protein fused to an engineered GFP molecule expressed from a commonly used yeast plasmid (pRS416-TEF1).

In this review, I focus on the current status of tag development for electron microscopic (EM) visualization of proteins with metal particle labeling. Compared with conventional immunoelectron microscopy using gold particles, tag-mediated metal particle labeling has several advantages that could potentially improve the sensitivity, spatial and temporal resolution, and applicability to a wide range of proteins of interest (POIs). It may enable researchers to detect single molecules in situ, allowing the quantitative measurement of absolute numbers and exact localization patterns of POI in the ultrastructural context.

Here we used a recently developed OpenUaa search engine to perform an in-depth analysis of mass spec data generated for Thioredoxin and its direct binding proteins cross-linked with an alkyl bromide-based ncAA, BprY. The analysis showed that, besides cysteine residues, BprY also targeted a broad range of nucleophilic amino acids. We validated this broad reactivity of BprY with Affibody/Z protein complex. We then successfully applied BprY to map a binding interface between SUMO2 and SUMO-interacting motifs (SIMs). BprY was further applied to probe SUMO2 interaction partners. We identified 264 SUMO2 binders, including several validated SUMO2 binders and many new binders. Our data demonstrated that BprY can be effectively used to probe protein-protein interaction interfaces even without cysteine residues, which will greatly expand the power of BprY in studying PPIs.",

A plethora of synthetic switches, circuits, and even higher order networks has been implemented in different organisms, such as bacteria and mammalian cells, and facilitates the study of signaling and metabolic pathways. However, the application of such tools in plants lags behind, and thus only a few genetically encoded biosensors and switches have been engineered toward the quantitative investigation of plant signaling. Here, we present a protocol for the quantitative analysis of auxin signaling in Arabidopsis thaliana protoplasts. We implemented genetically encoded, ratiometric, degradation-based luminescent biosensors and applied them for studying auxin perception dynamics. For this, we utilized three different Aux/IAAs as sensor modules and analyzed their degradation behavior in response to auxin. Our experimental approach requires simple hardware and experimental reagents and can thus be implemented in every plant-related or cell culture laboratory.

To address these dynamics, we performed in vivo imaging of neuronal activity in the CA1 field of the mouse hippocampus using genetically encoded green calcium indicators, including the novel NCaMP7 and FGCaMP7, designed specifically for in vivo calcium imaging. Mice were injected with a viral vector encoding calcium sensor, head-mounted with an NVista HD miniscope, and allowed to explore a completely novel environment (circular track surrounded by visual cues) without any reinforcement stimuli, in order to avoid potential interference from reward-related behavior. First, we calculated the average time required for each CA1 cell to acquire its place field. We found that 25% of CA1 place fields were formed at the first arrival in the corresponding place, while the average tuning latency for all place fields in a novel environment equaled 247 s. After 24 h, when the environment was familiar to the animals, place fields formed faster, independent of retention of cognitive maps during this session. No cumulation of selectivity score was observed between these two sessions. Using dimensionality reduction, we demonstrated that the population activity of rapidly tuned CA1 place cells allowed the reconstruction of the geometry of the navigated circular maze; the distribution of reconstruction error between the mice was consistent with the distribution of the average place field selectivity score in them. Our data thus show that neuronal activity recorded with genetically encoded calcium sensors revealed fast behavior-dependent plasticity in the mouse hippocampus, resulting in the rapid formation of place fields and population activity that allowed the reconstruction of the geometry of the navigated maze.",

We demonstrate that a combination of cell sorting and bioinformatics can accelerate the design of biosensors and formulate a mass action kinetics model to correlate the fluorescence response of SweetTrac1 with the transport of glucose.

In this work, we employed this method to monitor the early change in the PMP of yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae with intact cell wall, immediately following hyperosmotic up-shock due to various stress agents. The results pointed to differential effects of NaCl, sorbitol and polyethylene glycol (PEG) 6000. Yeast PMP was more responsive toward PEG 6000 than NaCl and sorbitol at comparable osmotic pressure, and PEG 6000 stimulated the largest response magnitude, followed by sorbitol and NaCl, respectively. After prolonged treatment, PEG 6000 also instigated distinct cell morphology from NaCl and sorbitol. Accordingly, this study presents new evidence supporting multiple pathways underlying yeast adaptation to varying hyperosmotic conditions, enabled through the optical physiology approach. Our findings promote better understanding of the yeast cellular response to hyperosmotic stress, with tenable relevance to the physiologically related plant cells.",

They have been studied since the 1940s and a broader use of different microscopy techniques to image either isolated vesicles or vesicles within the intracellular milieu (trafficking) has been limited by their nanometric size, usually below the resolution limit of most standard light microscopes. The development of genetically encoded fluorescent proteins and fluorescent probes able to switch between \"on\" and \"off\" states, as well the improvement in computer-assisted microscopy, photon detector devices, illumination designs, and imaging strategies in the late Twentieth century, boosted the use of light microscopes to provide structural and functional information at the sub-diffraction resolution, taking advantage of a nondestructive analytical probe such light, and opening new possibilities in the study of life at the nanoscale. As well, traditional and novel electron microscopy techniques have been widely used in the characterization of subcellular compartments, either isolated or in situ, providing a comprehensive understanding of their functional role in many cellular processes. Here, we present basic aspects of some of these techniques that have already been applied and their potential application to the study of fungal vesicles.",

Because Lp(a) isoforms have been associated with cardiovascular risk (CVR), we have investigated if their interfacial properties can contribute to distinguish between low and high-risk groups and thus be used as a new CVR indicator. Four Lp(a) variants, each carrying a different apo(a) isoform (K20, K24, K25, and K29), were purified from plasma of homozygous donors and their interfacial properties characterized using ellipsometry and surface pressure techniques. Ellipsometry measurements revealed that these isoforms had a similar propensity to form adsorbed layers at hydrophobic-hydrophilic interfaces, but surface pressure enabled to clearly separate them into two groups: K20 and K24 on one side, and K25 and K29 on the other side. Though K24 and K25 differ only by a single KIV-2 domain, their sharp difference in surface pressure suggests a critical threshold between the two Lp(a) forms, providing insights into the use of condensed matter approaches to monitor CVR. Our findings may represent a new laboratory window to assist medical decisions and to develop precision medicine treatments, practices, and products for CVR, which can be extended to other cardiovascular disease conditions.",

Despite a large calcium-dependent change in fluorescence intensity, the quantification of calcium concentrations with GECIs is problematic, which is further complicated by the sensitivity of all GECIs to changes in the pH in the biological range. Here, we report on a sensing strategy in which a conformational change directly modifies the fluorescence quantum yield and fluorescence lifetime of a circular permutated turquoise fluorescent protein. The fluorescence lifetime is an absolute parameter that enables straightforward quantification, eliminating intensity-related artifacts. An engineering strategy that optimizes lifetime contrast led to a biosensor that shows a 3-fold change in the calcium-dependent quantum yield and a fluorescence lifetime change of 1.3 ns. We dub the biosensor Turquoise Calcium Fluorescence LIfeTime Sensor (Tq-Ca-FLITS). The response of the calcium sensor is insensitive to pH between 6.2-9. As a result, Tq-Ca-FLITS enables robust measurements of intracellular calcium concentrations by fluorescence lifetime imaging. We demonstrate quantitative imaging of calcium concentrations with the turquoise GECI in single endothelial cells and human-derived organoids.",

Despite their physiological importance, untangling the relationship between DA and NE in the fine control of output function is currently challenging, primarily due to a lack of techniques to allow the observation of spatiotemporal dynamics with sufficiently high selectivity. Although genetically encoded fluorescent biosensors have been developed to detect DA, their poor selectivity prevents distinguishing DA from NE. Here, we report the development of a red fluorescent genetically encoded GPCR (G protein-coupled receptor)-activation reporter for DA termed 'R-GenGAR-DA'. More specifically, a circular permutated red fluorescent protein (cpmApple) was replaced by the third intracellular loop of human DA receptor D1 (DRD1) followed by the screening of mutants within the linkers between DRD1 and cpmApple. We developed two variants: R-GenGAR-DA1.1, which brightened following DA stimulation, and R-GenGAR-DA1.2, which dimmed. R-GenGAR-DA1.2 demonstrated a reasonable dynamic range (ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> = - 43%), DA affinity (EC<sub>50</sub> = 0.92 µM) and high selectivity for DA over NE (66-fold) in HeLa cells. Taking advantage of the high selectivity of R-GenGAR-DA1.2, we monitored DA in presence of NE using dual-color fluorescence live imaging, combined with the green-NE biosensor GRAB<sub>NE1m</sub>, which has high selectivity for NE over DA (> 350-fold) in HeLa cells and hippocampal neurons grown from primary culture. Thus, this is a first step toward the multiplex imaging of these neurotransmitters in, for example, freely moving animals, which will provide new opportunities to advance our understanding of the high spatiotemporal dynamics of DA and NE in normal and abnormal brain function.",

RNAP2 has a long heptapeptide repeat (Tyr1-Ser2-Pro3-Thr4-Ser5-Pro6-Ser7), and Ser2 is phosphorylated on an elongation form. To detect RNAP2 Ser2 phosphorylation (RNAP2 Ser2ph) in living cells, we developed a genetically encoded modification-specific intracellular antibody (mintbody) probe. The RNAP2 Ser2ph-mintbody exhibited numerous foci, possibly representing transcription \"factories,\" and foci were diminished during mitosis and in a Ser2 kinase inhibitor. An in vitro binding assay using phosphopeptides confirmed the mintbody's specificity. RNAP2 Ser2ph-mintbody foci were colocalized with proteins associated with elongating RNAP2 compared with factors involved in the initiation. These results support the view that mintbody localization represents the sites of RNAP2 Ser2ph in living cells. RNAP2 Ser2ph-mintbody foci showed constrained diffusional motion like chromatin, but they were more mobile than DNA replication domains and p300-enriched foci, suggesting that the elongating RNAP2 complexes are separated from more confined chromatin domains.",

        "abstract": "Normally, dendritic size is established prior to adolescence and then remains relatively constant into adulthood due to a homeostatic balance between growth and retraction pathways. However, schizophrenia is characterized by accelerated reductions of cerebral cortex gray matter volume and onset of clinical symptoms during adolescence, with reductions in layer 3 pyramidal neuron dendritic length, complexity, and spine density identified in multiple cortical regions postmortem. Nogo receptor 1 (NGR1) activation of the GTPase RhoA is a major pathway restricting dendritic growth in the cerebral cortex. We show that the NGR1 pathway is stimulated by OMGp and requires the Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor Kalirin-9 (KAL9). Using a genetically encoded RhoA sensor, we demonstrate that a naturally occurring missense mutation in <i>Kalrn</i>, KAL-PT, that was identified in a schizophrenia cohort, confers enhanced RhoA activitation in neuronal dendrites compared to wild-type KAL. In mice containing this missense mutation at the endogenous locus, there is an adolescent-onset reduction in dendritic length and complexity of layer 3 pyramidal neurons in the primary auditory cortex. Spine density per unit length of dendrite is unaffected. Early adult mice with these structural deficits exhibited impaired detection of short gap durations. These findings provide a neuropsychiatric model of disease capturing how a mild genetic vulnerability may interact with normal developmental processes such that pathology only emerges around adolescence. This interplay between genetic susceptibility and normal adolescent development, both of which possess inherent individual variability, may contribute to heterogeneity seen in phenotypes in human neuropsychiatric disease.",

        "abstract": "Bioassays using a fluorophore and DNA aptamer have been extensively developed due to the ultrasensitivity of fluorophores and recognition ability of DNA aptamers. Conventional fluorescent aptamer-based sensors (aptasensors) require chemical labeling between the fluorophore and aptamer and is technologically impracical for various sensing and assay applications. A simple \"mix and go\" strategy has been introduced that uses label-free technology as a platform for sensor development. The biosensors comprise a fluorophore, a ssDNA aptamer, and eco-friendly graphene oxide (GO). In the absence of the sensor target, GO quenches the fluorescence of the fluorophore and single-strand DNA aptamer complex. When the target is added, the DNA aptamer conformationally turns into a duplex, G-quadruplexe, or other secondary structure. This structure change leads to release of GO by the fluorophore-aptamer-target complex, generating dramatic fluorescence recovery and amplification. With this sensing method, the DNA aptamer does not need to be chemically labeled. Therefore, flexible fluorophore indicators and ssDNA aptamers can be used in this label-free aptasensing strategy. In this review, we discuss various unlabeled fluorophores, including synthetic small molecular fluorophores and genetically encoded fluorescent proteins, as indicators for generating GO-based fluorescent DNA aptasensors for label-free bioassay.",

To monitor extra- and intracellular glutamate concentrations in plants, we generated Arabidopsis lines expressing genetically encoded fluorescent glutamate sensors. In contrast to cytosolically localized sensors, extracellularly displayed variants inhibited plant growth and proper development. Phenotypic analyses of high-affinity display sensor lines revealed that root meristem development, particularly the quiescent center, number of lateral roots, vegetative growth, and floral architecture were impacted. Notably, the severity of the phenotypes was positively correlated with the affinity of the display sensors, intimating that their ability to sequester glutamate at the surface of the plasma membrane was responsible for the defects. Root growth defects were suppressed by supplementing culture media with low levels of glutamate. Together, the data indicate that sequestration of glutamate at the cell surface either disrupts the supply of glutamate to meristematic cells and/or impairs localized glutamatergic signaling important for developmental processes.",

        "abstract": "In a typical electrophysiology experiment, synaptic stimulus is delivered in a cortical layer (1-6) and neuronal responses are recorded intracellularly in individual neurons. We recreated this standard electrophysiological paradigm in brain slices of mice expressing genetically encoded voltage indicators (GEVIs). This allowed us to monitor membrane voltages in the target pyramidal neurons (whole-cell), and population voltages in the surrounding neuropil (optical imaging), simultaneously. Pyramidal neurons have complex dendritic trees that span multiple cortical layers. GEVI imaging revealed areas of the brain slice that experienced the strongest depolarization on a specific synaptic stimulus (location and intensity), thus identifying cortical layers that contribute the most afferent activity to the recorded somatic voltage waveform. By combining whole-cell with GEVI imaging, we obtained a crude distribution of activated synaptic afferents in respect to the dendritic tree of a pyramidal cell. Synaptically evoked voltage waves propagating through the cortical neuropil (dendrites and axons) were not static but rather they changed on a millisecond scale. Voltage imaging can identify areas of brain slices in which the neuropil was in a sustained depolarization (plateau), long after the stimulus onset. Upon a barrage of synaptic inputs, a cortical pyramidal neuron experiences: (a) weak temporal summation of evoked voltage transients (EPSPs); and (b) afterhyperpolarization (intracellular recording), which are not represented in the GEVI population imaging signal (optical signal). To explain these findings [(a) and (b)], we used four voltage indicators (ArcLightD, chi-VSFP, Archon1, and di-4-ANEPPS) with different optical sensitivity, optical response speed, labeling strategy, and a target neuron type. All four imaging methods were used in an identical experimental paradigm: layer 1 (L1) synaptic stimulation, to allow direct comparisons. The population voltage signal showed paired-pulse facilitation, caused in part by additional recruitment of new neurons and dendrites. \"<i>Synaptic stimulation</i>\" delivered in L1 depolarizes almost an entire cortical column to some degree.",

Despite its psychophysiological importance as a neuromodulator in the CNS, effective techniques capable of monitoring oxytocin dynamics or testing related behavioral consequences are limited. Along with an explosive advancement in synthetic biology, high-performance genetically-encoded neuromodulator sensors are being developed. Here we comprehensively review the current methodologies available for detecting oxytocin in neuroscience. Their strengths and weaknesses are discussed, and a graphical summary is plotted for better comparison of techniques.

        "abstract": "Genetically encoded reporters have greatly increased our understanding of biology. While fluorescent reporters have been widely used, photostability and phototoxicity have hindered their use in long-term experiments. Bioluminescence overcomes some of these challenges but requires the addition of an exogenous luciferin limiting its use. Using a modular approach, Autonomous Molecular BioluminEscent Reporter (AMBER), an indicator of membrane potential is engineered. Unlike other bioluminescent systems, AMBER is a voltage-gated luciferase coupling the functionalities of the Ciona voltage-sensing domain (VSD) and bacterial luciferase, luxAB. When co-expressed with the luciferin-producing genes, AMBER reversibly switches the bioluminescent intensity as a function of membrane potential. Using biophysical and biochemical methods, it is shown that AMBER switches its enzymatic activity from an OFF to an ON state as a function of the membrane potential. Upon depolarization, AMBER switches from a low to a high enzymatic activity state, showing a several-fold increase in the bioluminescence output (ΔL/L). AMBER in the pharyngeal muscles and mechanosensory touch neurons of Caenorhabditis elegans is expressed. Using the compressed sensing approach, the electropharingeogram of the C. elegans pharynx is reconstructed, validating the sensor in vivo. Thus, AMBER represents the first fully genetically encoded bioluminescent reporter without requiring exogenous luciferin addition.",

UDP-GlcNAc also serves as the donor substrate for forming <i>O</i>-GlcNAc, a dynamic intracellular protein modification involved in diverse signaling and disease processes. UDP-GlcNAc is thus a central metabolite connecting nutrition, metabolism, signaling, and disease. There is a great interest in monitoring UDP-GlcNAc in biological systems. Here, we present the first genetically encoded, green fluorescent UDP-GlcNAc sensor (UGAcS), an optimized insertion of a circularly permuted green fluorescent protein (cpGFP) into an inactive mutant of an <i>Escherichia coli</i> UDP-GlcNAc transferase, for ratiometric monitoring of UDP-GlcNAc dynamics in live mammalian cells. Although UGAcS responds to UDP-GlcNAc quite selectively among various nucleotide sugars, UDP and uridine triphosphate (UTP) interfere with the response. We thus developed another biosensor named UXPS, which is responsive to UDP and UTP but not UDP-GlcNAc. We demonstrated the use of the biosensors to follow UDP-GlcNAc levels in cultured mammalian cells perturbed with nutritional changes, pharmacological inhibition, and knockdown or overexpression of key enzymes in the UDP-GlcNAc synthesis pathway.

Here, we present Strigo-D2, a genetically encoded ratiometric SL signaling sensor that enables the examination of SL signaling distribution at cellular resolution and is capable of rapid response to altered SL levels in intact Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) plants. By monitoring the abundance of a truncated and fluorescently labeled SUPPRESSOR OF MAX2 1-LIKE 6 (SMXL6) protein, a proteolytic target of the SL signaling machinery, we show that all cell types investigated have the capacity to respond to changes in SL levels but with very different dynamics. In particular, SL signaling is pronounced in vascular cells but low in guard cells and the meristematic region of the root. We also show that other hormones leave Strigo-D2 activity unchanged, indicating that initial SL signaling steps work in isolation from other hormonal signaling pathways. The specificity and spatio-temporal resolution of Strigo-D2 underline the value of the sensor for monitoring SL signaling in a broad range of biological contexts with highly instructive analytical depth.",

During LLPS, proteins and nucleotides are extremely condensed, resulting in changes in their conformation and biological functions. Disturbed LLPS homeostasis in MLOs is thought to associate with fatal diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Therefore, it is important to detect changes in the degree of crowding in MLOs. However, it has not been investigated well due to the lack of an appropriate method. To address this, we developed a genetically encoded macromolecular crowding sensor CRONOS (crowding sensor with mNeonGreen and mScarlet-I) that senses the degree of macromolecular crowding in MLOs using a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) system. CRONOS is a bright biosensor with a wide dynamic range and successfully detects changes in the macromolecular volume fraction in solution. By fusing to the scaffold protein of each MLO, we delivered CRONOS to MLO of interest and detected previously undescribed differences in the degree of crowding in each MLO. CRONOS also detected changes in the degree of macromolecular crowding in nucleolus induced by environmental stress or inhibition of transcription. These findings suggest that CRONOS can be a useful tool for the determination of molecular crowding and detection of pathological changes in MLOs in live cells.",

This protocol describes brain surgeries for deep brain in vivo calcium imaging using a custom-developed miniscope recording system. The preparation procedure consists of three steps, including (1) stereotaxically injecting the virus at the desired brain region of a mouse brain to label a specific subgroup of neurons with genetically encoded calcium sensor; (2) implantation of gradient-index (GRIN) lens that can relay calcium image from deep brain region to the miniscope system; and (3) affixing the miniscope holder over the mouse skull where miniscope can be attached later. To perform in vivo calcium imaging, the miniscope is fastened onto the holder, and neuronal calcium images are collected along with simultaneous behavior recordings.

Here, we describe detailed methodology on imaging neuronal cohorts longitudinally throughout postnatal stages in the mouse somatosensory cortex. To capture neuronal activity, we expressed the genetically encoded calcium sensor GCaMP6s in three distinct interneuron populations, the 5HT3aR-expressing layer 1 (L1) interneurons, SST interneurons, and VIP interneurons. We performed cranial window surgeries as early as postnatal day (P) 5 and imaged the same cohort of neurons in un-anesthetized mice from P6 to P36.

However, the addition of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> to the culture medium of cells or tissues approach does not accurately replicate intracellular redox-mediated cell responses. d-amino acid oxidase (DAAO)-based chemogenetic tools represent informative methodological advances that permit the generation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> on demand with a high spatiotemporal resolution by providing or withdrawing the DAAO substrate d-amino acids. Much has been learned about the intracellular transport of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> through studies using DAAO, yet these valuable tools remain incompletely characterized in many cultured cells. In this study, we describe and characterize in detail the features of a new modified variant of DAAO (termed mDAAO) with improved catalytic activities. We tested mDAAO functionality in several cultured cell lines employing live-cell imaging techniques. Our imaging experiments show that mDAAO is suitable for the generation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> under hypoxic conditions imaged with the novel ultrasensitive H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> sensor (HyPer7). Moreover, this approach was suitable for generating H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in a reversible and concentration-dependent manner in subcellular locales. Furthermore, we show that the choice of d-amino acids differentially affects mDAAO-dependent intracellular H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> generation. When paired with the hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S) sensor hsGFP, administration of the sulfur-containing amino acid d-cysteine to cells expressing mDAAO generates robust H<sub>2</sub>S signals. We also show that chemogenetic H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> generation in different cell types yields distinct HyPer7 profiles. These studies fully characterize the new mDAAO as a novel chemogenetic tool and provide multiparametric approaches for cell manipulation that may open new lines of investigations for redox biochemists to dissect the role of ROS signaling pathways with high spatial and temporal precision.",

Here, a genetically encoded protein thermometer (human enhanced gene activation thermometer; HEAT) is designed that can trigger transgene expression in the range of 37-40 °C by linking a mutant coiled-coil temperature-responsive protein sensor to a synthetic transcription factor. To validate the construct, a HEAT-transgenic monoclonal human cell line, FeverSense, is generated and it is confirmed that it works as a fever sensor that can temperature- and exposure-time-dependently trigger reporter gene expression in vitro and in vivo. For translational proof of concept, microencapsulated designer cells stably expressing a HEAT-controlled insulin production cassette in a mouse model of type-1 diabetes are subcutaneously implanted and topical heating patches are used to apply heat corresponding to a warm sensation in humans.

        "abstract": "In the developing central nervous system, electrical signaling is thought to rely exclusively on differentiating neurons as they acquire the ability to generate and propagate action potentials. Accordingly, neuroepithelial progenitors (NEPs), which give rise to all neurons and glial cells during development, have been reported to remain electrically passive. Here, we investigated the physiological properties of NEPs at the onset of spontaneous neural activity (SNA) initiating motor behavior in mouse embryonic spinal cord. Using patch-clamp recordings, we discovered that spinal NEPs exhibit spontaneous membrane depolarizations during episodes of SNA. These rhythmic depolarizations exhibited a ventral-to-dorsal gradient with the highest amplitude located in the floor plate, the ventral-most part of the neuroepithelium. Paired recordings revealed that NEPs are coupled via gap junctions and form an electrical syncytium. Although other NEPs were electrically passive, we discovered that floor-plate NEPs generated large Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> action potentials. Unlike in neurons, floor-plate action potentials relied primarily on the activation of voltage-gated T-type calcium channels (TTCCs). In situ hybridization showed that all 3 known subtypes of TTCCs are predominantly expressed in the floor plate. During SNA, we found that acetylcholine released by motoneurons rhythmically triggers floor-plate action potentials by acting through nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. Finally, by expressing the genetically encoded calcium indicator GCaMP6f in the floor plate, we demonstrated that neuroepithelial action potentials are associated with calcium waves and propagate along the entire length of the spinal cord. Our work reveals a novel physiological mechanism to generate and propagate electrical signals across a neural structure independently from neurons.",

Here, we use fast, voltage imaging of L2/3 cortical pyramidal neurons exclusively expressing the genetically-encoded voltage indicator Butterfly 1.2, in awake, head-fixed mice, receiving sensory stimulation, whilst manipulating the cholinergic system. Altering muscarinic acetylcholine function re-shaped sensory-evoked fast depolarisation and subsequent slow hyperpolarisation of L2/3 pyramidal neurons. A consequence of this re-shaping was disrupted adaptation of the sensory-evoked responses, suggesting a critical role for acetylcholine during sensory discrimination behaviour. Our findings provide new insights into how the cortex processes sensory information and how loss of acetylcholine, for example in Alzheimer's Disease, disrupts sensory behaviours.",

        "abstract": "In type 1 diabetes (T1D) development, proinflammatory cytokines (PIC) released by immune cells lead to increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in β-cells. Nonetheless, the temporality of the events triggered and the role of different ROS sources remain unclear. Isolated islets from C57BL/6J wild-type (WT), NOX1 KO and NOX2 KO mice were exposed to a PIC combination. We show that cytokines increase O<sub>2</sub><sup>•-</sup> production after 2 h in WT and NOX1 KO but not in NOX2 KO islets. Using transgenic mice constitutively expressing a genetically encoded compartment specific H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> sensor, we show, for the first time, a transient increase of cytosolic/nuclear H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in islet cells between 4 and 5 h during cytokine exposure. The H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> increase coincides with the intracellular NAD(P)H decrease and is absent in NOX2 KO islets. NOX2 KO confers better glucose tolerance and protects against cytokine-induced islet secretory dysfunction and death. However, NOX2 absence does not counteract the cytokine effects in ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> depletion, Store-Operated Calcium Entry (SOCE) increase and ER stress. Instead, the activation of ER stress precedes H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production. As early NOX2-driven ROS production impacts β-cells' function and survival during insulitis, NOX2 might be a potential target for designing therapies against early β-cell dysfunction in the context of T1D onset.",

Current examples of MRI-based calcium probes involve synthetic molecules and nanoparticles, which cannot be used to examine calcium signaling in a genetically encoded form. Here, we describe a new MRI sensor for calcium, based entirely on a naturally occurring calcium-binding protein known as calprotectin. Calcium-binding causes calprotectin to sequester manganese ions, thereby limiting Mn<sup>2+</sup> enhanced paramagnetic relaxation of nearby water molecules. We demonstrate that this mechanism allows calprotectin to alter T<sub>1</sub> and T<sub>2</sub> based MRI signals in response to biologically relevant calcium concentrations. The resulting response amplitude, i.e., change in relaxation time, is comparable to existing MRI-based calcium sensors as well as other reported protein-based MRI sensors. As a preliminary demonstration of its biological applicability, we used calprotectin to detect calcium in a lysed hippocampal cell preparation as well as in intact Chinese hamster ovary cells treated with a calcium ionophore. Calprotectin thus represents a promising path toward noninvasive imaging of calcium signaling by combining the molecular and cellular specificity of genetically encodable tools with the ability of MRI to image through scattering tissue of any size and depth.",

Gene perturbation screens could provide a powerful approach to probe the molecular mechanisms of protein trafficking, but only if protein localization or mislocalization can be tied to a simple and robust phenotype for cell selection, such as cell proliferation or fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). To empower the study of protein trafficking processes with gene perturbation, we developed a genetically encoded molecular tool named HiLITR (High-throughput Localization Indicator with Transcriptional Readout). HiLITR converts protein colocalization into proteolytic release of a membrane-anchored transcription factor, which drives the expression of a chosen reporter gene. Using HiLITR in combination with FACS-based CRISPRi screening in human cell lines, we identified genes that influence the trafficking of mitochondrial and ER tail-anchored proteins. We show that loss of the SUMO E1 component SAE1 results in mislocalization and destabilization of many mitochondrial tail-anchored proteins. We also demonstrate a distinct regulatory role for EMC10 in the ER membrane complex, opposing the transmembrane-domain insertion activity of the complex. Through transcriptional integration of complex cellular functions, HiLITR expands the scope of biological processes that can be studied by genetic perturbation screening technologies.",

Optical measurement of membrane potentials through voltage imaging is a desirable approach, enabling fast, direct, and simultaneous detection of membrane potentials in a population of neurons. Its high speed and directness can help detect synaptic and action potentials and hyperpolarization, which encode critical information for brain function. Here, we describe in vivo voltage imaging procedures that we have recently established using zebrafish, a powerful animal model in developmental biology and neuroscience. By applying two types of voltage sensors, voltage-sensitive dyes (VSDs, Di-4-ANEPPS) and genetically encoded voltage indicators (GEVIs, ASAP1), spatiotemporal dynamics of voltage signals can be detected in the whole cerebellum and spinal cord in awake fish at single-cell and neuronal population levels.

However, GETIs have suffered from poor temperature sensitivity, which may not be sufficient to resolve small heat production from a biological process. Here, we develop a highly-sensitive GETI, denoted as ELP-TEMP, comprised of a temperature-responsive elastin-like polypeptide (ELP) fused with a cyan fluorescent protein (FP), mTurquoise2 (mT), and a yellow FP, mVenus (mV), as the donor and acceptor, respectively, of Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET). At elevated temperatures, the ELP moiety in ELP-TEMP undergoes a phase transition leading to an increase in the FRET efficiency. In HeLa cells, ELP-TEMP responded to the temperature from 33 to 40 °C with a maximum temperature sensitivity of 45.1 ± 8.1%/°C, which was the highest ever temperature sensitivity among hitherto-developed fluorescent nanothermometers. Although ELP-TEMP showed sensitivity not only to temperature but also to macromolecular crowding and self-concentration, we were able to correct the output of ELP-TEMP to achieve accurate temperature measurements at a subcellular resolution. We successfully applied ELP-TEMP to accurately measure temperature changes in cells induced by a local heat spot, even if the temperature difference was as small as < 1 °C, and to visualize heat production from stimulated Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx in live HeLa cells induced by a chemical stimulation. Furthermore, we investigated temperatures in the nucleus and cytoplasm of live HeLa cells and found that their temperatures were almost the same within the temperature resolution of our measurement. Our study would contribute to better understanding of cellular temperature dynamics, and ELP-TEMP would be a useful GETI for the investigation of cell thermobiology.",

In the nervous system, cAMP integrates inputs from many neuromodulators across a wide range of timescales - from seconds to hours - to modulate neuronal excitability and plasticity in brain circuits during different animal behavioral states. cAMP signaling events are both cell-specific and subcellularly compartmentalized. The same stimulus may result in different, sometimes opposite, cAMP dynamics in different cells or subcellular compartments. Additionally, the activity of protein kinase A (PKA), a major cAMP effector, is also spatiotemporally regulated. For these reasons, many laboratories have made great strides toward visualizing the intracellular dynamics of cAMP and PKA. To date, more than 80 genetically encoded sensors, including original and improved variants, have been published. It is starting to become possible to visualize cAMP and PKA signaling events in vivo, which is required to study behaviorally relevant cAMP/PKA signaling mechanisms. Despite significant progress, further developments are needed to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio and practical utility of these sensors.

Aberrant changes involving lysine acetylation modification are commonly reported in multiple types of cancers. Currently, whether it is for in vivo or in vitro, there are limited approaches for the detection of H4 lysine acetylation levels. In particular, the main problems are the high cost and the cumbersome detection process, such as for radioactive <sup>14</sup>C isotope detection. Therefore, there is an important need to develop a simple, fast, and low-cost means of detection. In this study, we reported the development of a gene-coding protein sensor. This protein sensor was designed based on the mechanism of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). The four kinds of sensors, varying from substrate and linker length, were evaluated, with ~20% increases in response efficiency. Next, sensors with different lysine mutation sites in the substrate sequence or mutation of key amino acids in the binding domain were also analyzed to determine site specificity. We found single-site lysine mutant could not cause a significant decrease in response efficiency. Furthermore, addition of MG149, a histone acetyltransferase inhibitor, resulted in a decrease in the ratio change value. Moreover, histone deacetylase1 HDAC1 was also found to reduce the ratio change values when added to reaction system. Finally, the optimized sensor was applied to living cells and established to provide a sensitive response with overexpression and knockdown of MOF (males absent on the first). These results indicated that the sensor can be used for screening chemical drugs regulating H4 N-terminal lysine acetylation level in vitro, as well as monitoring dynamic changes of lysine acetylation levels in living cells.",

For one construct which exhibits a high change in energy transfer and a large change of the radius of gyration upon ligand binding, we performed coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations for the ligand-free and the ligand-bound state. Our analysis indicates that a carefully designed attachment of the donor FP is crucial for the proper transfer of the glucose induced conformational change of the glucose binding protein into a well pronounced FRET signal change as measured in this sensor construct.

        "abstract": "We investigated hair-cell regeneration in the zebrafish lateral line following the application of the ototoxic compound copper. In early-larval zebrafish (<10 days post-fertilisation), regenerated hair cells drive action potentials (APs) in the afferent neurons 24 h post-copper treatment (24 hpt). Full regeneration of the early-larval neuromasts, the organs containing the hair cells, requires ∼48 h due to the progressive addition of hair cells and synaptic refinement. In older larval zebrafish, regenerated hair cells are active and drive afferent APs by 48 hpt, which is comparable to larvae, but the functional recovery of their neuromasts requires >120 hpt. Afferent terminals within the regenerating neuromast appear to initially contact supporting cells, and their complete ablation prevents the timely reappearance of supporting cells and hair cells. We conclude that the regeneration of zebrafish neuromasts is slower after the initial developmental stages, and that the afferent input plays a key role in driving this process. Hair cells are mechanosensory receptors responsible for transducing auditory and vestibular information into electrical signals, which are then transmitted with remarkable precision to afferent neurons. Different from mammals, the hair cells of lower vertebrates, including those present in the neuromasts of the zebrafish lateral line, regenerate following environmental or chemical insults. Here we investigate the time course of regeneration of hair cells in vivo using electrophysiology, two-photon imaging and immunostaining applied to wild-type and genetically encoded fluorescent indicator zebrafish lines. Functional hair cells drive spontaneous action potentials in the posterior lateral line afferent fibres, the frequency of which progressively increases over the first 10 days post-fertilisation (dpf). Higher firing-rate fibres are only observed from ∼6 dpf. Following copper treatment, newly formed hair cells become functional and are able to drive APs in the afferent fibres within 48 h in both early-larval (≤8 dpf) and late-larval (12-17 dpf) zebrafish. However, the complete functional regeneration of the entire neuromast is delayed in late-larval compared to early-larval zebrafish. We propose that while individual regenerating hair cells can rapidly become active, the acquisition of fully functional neuromasts progresses faster at early-larval stages, a time when hair cells are still under development. At both ages, the afferent terminals in the regenerating neuromast appear to make initial contact with supporting cells. The ablation of the lateral line afferent neurons prevents the timely regeneration of supporting cells and hair cells. These findings indicate that the afferent system is likely to facilitate or promote the neuromast regeneration process.",

Commercially, it is used in the production of antiviral drugs, infant milk formulas, cosmetics, dietary supplements, and pharmaceutical products. Because of the rapidly increasing demand, metabolic engineering approach has attracted increasing attention for NeuAc biosynthesis. However, knowledge of metabolite flux in biosynthetic pathways is one of the major challenges in the practice of metabolic engineering. So, an understanding of the flux of NeuAc is needed to determine its cellular level at real time. The analysis of the flux can only be performed using a tool that has the capacity to measure metabolite level in cells without affecting other metabolic processes. A Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET)-based genetically-encoded nanosensor has been generated in this study to monitor the level of NeuAc in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. Sialic acid periplasmic binding protein (SiaP) from <i>Haemophilus influenzae</i> was exploited as a sensory element for the generation of nanosensor. The enhanced cyan fluorescent protein (ECFP) and Venus were used as Fluroscence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) pair. The nanosensor, which was termed fluorescent indicator protein for sialic acid (FLIP-SA), was successfully transformed into, and expressed in <i>Escherichia coli</i> BL21 (DE3) cells. The expressed protein of the nanosensor was isolated and purified. The purified nanosensor protein was characterized to assess the affinity, specificity, and stability in the pH range. The developed nanosensor exhibited FRET change after addition to NeuAc. The developed nanosensor was highly specific, exhibited pH stability, and detected NeuAc levels in the nanomolar to milimolar range. FLIP-SA was successfully introduced in bacterial and yeast cells and reported the real-time intracellular levels of NeuAc non-invasively. The FLIP-SA is an excellent tool for the metabolic flux analysis of the NeuAc biosynthetic pathway and, thus, may help unravel the regulatory mechanism of the metabolic pathway of NeuAc. Furthermore, FLIP-SA can be used for the high-throughput screening of <i>E. coli</i> mutant libraries for varied NeuAc production levels.",

        "abstract": "Proteins involved in neurodegeneration can be coupled with optogenetic reagents to create rapid and sensitive reporters to provide insight into the biochemical processes that mediate the progression of neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's Disease (AD). We have recently developed a novel optically-responsive tool (the '<b>CofActor'</b> system) that couples <b><i>cof</i></b> <i>ilin</i> and <b><i>act</i></b> <i>in</i> (key players in early stage cytoskeletal abnormalities associated with neurodegenerative disorders) with <i>light-gated optogenetic proteins</i> to provide spatial and temporal resolution of oxidative and energetic stress-dependent biochemical events. In contrast to currently available small-molecule based biosensors for monitoring changes in the redox environment of the cell, CofActor is a <i>light-activated</i>, genetically encoded redox sensor that can be activated with precise <i>spatial</i> and <i>temporal control</i>. Here we describe a protocol for the expression and activation of the CofActor system in dissociated hippocampal neuron cultures prepared from newborn mice. Cultures were transfected with Lipofectamine on the fifth day <i>in vitro</i> (DIV5), then exposed to cellular stress inducing stimuli, leading to the formation of actin-cofilin rods that can be observed using live cell imaging techniques. The protocol described here allows for studies of stress-related cytoskeletal dysregulation in live neurons exposed to neurodegenerative stimuli, such as toxic Aβ42 oligomers. Moreover, expression of the sensor in neurons isolated from transgenic mouse models of AD and/or mice KO for proteins involved in AD can advance our understanding of the molecular basis of early cytoskeletal dysfunctions associated with neurodegeneration.",

        "abstract": "Melanocytes are specialized cells that produce melanin pigments responsible for skin, hair, and eye pigmentation. The synthesis and storage of melanin occurs in unique lysosome-related organelles called melanosomes, which regulate melanin production via complex regulatory mechanisms. Maintenance of the melanosome luminal ionic environment and pH is crucial for proper function of the main melanogenic enzymes. Defects in genes encoding pH-regulating melanosomal proteins result in oculocutaneous albinism, which is characterized by hypopigmentation, impaired vision, and increased susceptibility to skin and eye cancers. We recently uncovered several ion channels and transporters that modulate melanin synthesis by acidifying or neutralizing the luminal pH of melanosomes. However, our understanding of how melanosomes and other related organelles maintain their luminal pH is far from complete. The study of melanosome pH regulation requires robust imaging and quantification tools. Despite recent advances in the development of such methods, many limitations remain, particularly for quantitative analysis of individual organelle pH. In this chapter, we will provide an overview of the available methods used for melanosome pH determination, including their advantages, limitations, and challenges. To address the critical, unmet need for reliable melanosome pH quantification tools, we engineered a novel genetically encoded, ratiometric pH sensor for melanosomes that we named RpHiMEL. Here, we describe the design and optimization of RpHiMEL, and provide a pH quantification method for individual melanosomes in live cells. We demonstrate that RpHiMEL is a highly versatile tool with the potential to advance our understanding of pH regulation in melanosomes and related organelles.",

        "abstract": "In the last decades, membrane contact sites (MCSs) have been the object of intense investigation in different fields of cell physiology and pathology and their importance for the correct functioning of the cell is now widely recognized. MCS between any known intercellular organelles, including endoplasmic reticulum (ER), mitochondria, Golgi, endosomes, peroxisomes, lysosomes, lipid droplets, and the plasma membrane (PM), have been largely documented and in some cases the molecules responsible for the tethering also identified. They represent specific membrane hubs where a tightly coordinated exchange of ions, lipids, nutrients, and factors required to maintain proper cellular homeostasis takes place. Their delicate, dynamic, and sometimes elusive nature prevented and/or delayed the development of tools to easily image interorganelle proximity under physiological conditions and in living organisms. Nowadays, this aspect received great momentum due to the finding that MCSs' dysregulation is involved in several pathological conditions. We have recently developed modular, split-GFP-based contact site sensors (SPLICS) engineered to fluoresce when homo- and heterotypic juxtapositions between ER and mitochondria occur over a range of specific distances. Here we describe in detail, by highlighting strengths and weaknesses, the use and the application of these novel genetically encoded SPLICS sensors and how to properly quantify short- and long-range ER-mitochondria interactions.",

This hybrid labeling system integrating chemical probes with genetically encoded techniques enables molecular position reconstructions of ER morphologies through direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM) imaging.

Ca<sup>2+</sup> is a versatile intracellular messenger involved in sensing a wide variety of stresses and regulating the subsequent cellular responses. So far, our understanding for calcium signaling was mostly obtained from ex vivo tissues and cultured cell lines, and the in vivo spatiotemporal dynamics of stress-triggered calcium signaling in a vertebrate remains to be characterized. Here, we describe the generation and characterization of a transgenic zebrafish line with ubiquitous expression of GCaMP6s, a genetically encoded calcium indicator (GECI). We developed a method to investigate the spatiotemporal patterns of Ca<sup>2+</sup> events induced by heat stress. Exposure to heat stress elicited immediate and transient calcium signaling in developing zebrafish. Cells extensively distributed in the integument of the head and body trunk were the first batch of responders and different cell populations demonstrated distinct response patterns upon heat stress. Activity of the heat stress-induced calcium signaling peaked at 30 s and swiftly decreased to near the basal level at 120 s after the beginning of exposure. Inhibition of the heat-induced calcium signaling by LaCl<sub>3</sub> and capsazepine and treatment with the inhibitors for CaMKII (Ca²<sup>2</sup>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II) and HSF1 (Heat shock factor 1) all significantly depressed the enhanced heat shock response (HSR).

However, a major challenge in the field is that the crosstalk between many cellular signaling pathways use the same signaling endogenous molecules that can result in undesired activation. To overcome this problem, we utilized a specific promoter that can activate genes with a natural, non-toxic ligand at a highly-induced transcription level with low background or undesirable off-target expression. Here we used the orphan aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), a ligand-activated transcription factor that upon activation binds to specific AHR response elements (AHRE) of the Cytochrome P450, family 1, subfamily A, polypeptide 1 (CYP1A1) promoter.

We compare data generated using the DIY manipulator with commercial micromanipulators costing over $1000. The second tool is our newly designed 3D printed epi-fluorescence microscope. Commercial fluorescence imaging devices often cost over $20,000, but our 3D printed version is constructed for less than $1200.

        "abstract": "Plasmodione (PD) is a potent antimalarial redox-active 3-benzyl-menadione acting at low nanomolar range concentrations on different malaria parasite stages. The specific bioactivation of PD was proposed to occur via a cascade of redox reactions starting from one-electron reduction and then benzylic oxidation, leading to the generation of several key metabolites including corresponding benzylic alcohol (PD-bzol, for PD benzhydrol) and 3-benzoylmenadione (PDO, for PD oxide). In this study, we showed that the benzylic oxidation of PD is closely related to the formation of a benzylic semiquinone radical, which can be produced under two conditions: UV photoirradiation or catalysis by <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> apicoplast ferredoxin-NADP<sup>+</sup> reductase (<i>Pf</i>FNR) redox cycling in the presence of oxygen and the parent PD. Electrochemical properties of both PD metabolites were investigated in DMSO and in water. The single-electron reduction potential values of PD, PD-bzol, PDO, and a series of 3-benzoylmenadiones were determined according to ascorbate oxidation kinetics. These compounds possess enhanced reactivity toward <i>Pf</i>FNR as compared with model quinones. Optimal conditions were set up to obtain the best conversion of the starting PD to the corresponding metabolites. UV irradiation of PD in isopropanol under positive oxygen pressure led to an isolated yield of 31% PDO through the transient semiquinone species formed in a cascade of reactions. In the presence of <i>Pf</i>FNR, PDO and PD-bzol could be observed during long lasting redox cycling of PD continuously fueled by NADPH regenerated by an enzymatic system. Finally, we observed and quantified the effect of PD on the production of oxidative stress in the apicoplast of transgenic 3D7<sup>[Api-roGFP2-hGrx1]</sup><i>P. falciparum</i> parasites by using the described genetically encoded glutathione redox sensor hGrx1-roGFP2 methodology. The observed fast reactive oxygen species (ROS) pulse released in the apicoplast is proposed to be mediated by PD redox cycling catalyzed by <i>Pf</i>FNR.",

        "abstract": "Vitamin E plays an exemplary role in living organisms. α-Tocopherol is the most superior and active form of naturally occurring vitamin E that meets the requirements of human beings as it possesses the α-tocopherol transfer protein (α-TTP). α-Tocopherol deficiency can lead to severe anemia, certain cancers, several neurodegenerative and cardiovascular diseases, and most importantly male infertility. As a result of the depletion of its natural sources, researchers have tried to employ metabolic engineering to enhance α-tocopherol production to meet the human consumption demand. However, the metabolic engineering approach relies on the metabolic flux of a metabolite in its biosynthetic pathway. Analysis of the metabolic flux of a metabolite needs a method that can monitor the α-tocopherol level in living cells. This study was undertaken to construct a FRET (fluorescence resonance energy transfer)-based nanosensor for monitoring the α-tocopherol flux in prokaryotic and eukaryotic living cells. The human α-TTP was sandwiched between a pair of FRET fluorophores to construct the nanosensor, which was denoted as FLIP-α (the fluorescence indicator for α-tocopherol). FLIP-α showed excellence in monitoring the α-tocopherol flux with high specificity. The sensor was examined for its pH stability for physiological applications, where it shows no pH hindrance to its activity. The calculated affinity of this nanosensor was 100 μM. It monitored the real-time flux of α-tocopherol in bacterial and yeast cells, proving its biocompatibility in monitoring the α-tocopherol dynamics in living cells. Being noninvasive, FLIP-α provides high temporal and spatial resolutions, which holds an indispensable significance in bioimaging metabolic pathways that are highly compartmentalized.",

Its dynamic redistribution has an essential role in almost every aspect of plant life, ranging from cell shape and division to organogenesis and responses to light and gravity<sup>1,2</sup>. So far, it has not been possible to directly determine the spatial and temporal distribution of auxin at a cellular resolution. Instead it is inferred from the visualization of irreversible processes that involve the endogenous auxin-response machinery<sup>3-7</sup>; however, such a system cannot detect transient changes. Here we report a genetically encoded biosensor for the quantitative in vivo visualization of auxin distribution. The sensor is based on the Escherichia coli tryptophan repressor<sup>8</sup>, the binding pocket of which is engineered to be specific to auxin. Coupling of the auxin-binding moiety with selected fluorescent proteins enables the use of a fluorescence resonance energy transfer signal as a readout. Unlike previous systems, this sensor enables direct monitoring of the rapid uptake and clearance of auxin by individual cells and within cell compartments in planta. By responding to the graded spatial distribution along the root axis and its perturbation by transport inhibitors-as well as the rapid and reversible redistribution of endogenous auxin in response to changes in gravity vectors-our sensor enables real-time monitoring of auxin concentrations at a (sub)cellular resolution and their spatial and temporal changes during the lifespan of a plant.",

Calcium-induced conformation change of TN-XXL results in FRET-donor quenching measurable by two-photon fluorescence lifetime imaging. For the first time, using our novel numerical analysis, we extract absolute cytoplasmic calcium concentrations in activated B cells during affinity maturation in vivo. We show that calcium in activated B cells is highly dynamic and that activation introduces a persistent calcium heterogeneity to the lineage.

The development of genetically encoded molecular tension sensors now allows the quantification of piconewton-scale forces that act upon distinct molecules in living cells and even whole organisms. In this review, we discuss the physical principles, advantages, and limitations of this increasingly popular method. By highlighting current examples from the literature, we demonstrate how molecular tension sensors can be utilized to obtain access to previously unappreciated biophysical parameters that define the propagation of mechanical forces on molecular scales.

Among these technologies, tapered optical fibers (TFs) take advantage of the modal properties of narrowing waveguides to enable both depth-resolved and wide-volume light collection from scattering tissue, with minimized invasiveness with respect to standard flat fiber stubs (FFs). However, light guided in patch cords as well as in FFs and TFs can result in autofluorescence (AF) signal, which can act as a source of time-variable noise and limit their application to probe fluorescence lifetime <i>in vivo</i>. In this work, we compare the AF signal of FFs and TFs, highlighting the influence of the cladding composition on AF generation. We show that the autofluorescence signal generated in TFs has a peculiar coupling pattern with guided modes, and that far-field detection can be exploited to separate functional fluorescence from AF. On these bases, we provide evidence that TFs can be employed to implement <i>depth-resolved fluorescence lifetime photometry</i>, potentially enabling the extraction of a new set of information from deep brain regions, as time-correlating single photon counting starts to be applied in freely-moving animals to monitor the intracellular biochemical state of neurons.",

Their function often depends on the changes in molecular arrangements of constituents, both in the positions and orientations. While recent advancements of fluorescence microscopy including super-resolution microscopy have enabled us to determine the positions of fluorophores with unprecedented accuracy, monitoring the orientation of fluorescently labeled molecules within living cells in real time is challenging. Fluorescence polarization microscopy (FPM) reports the orientation of emission dipoles and is therefore a promising solution. For imaging with FPM, target proteins need labeling with fluorescent probes in a sterically constrained manner, but because of difficulties in the rational three-dimensional design of protein connection, a universal method for constrained tagging with fluorophore was not available. Here, we report POLArIS, a genetically encoded and versatile probe for molecular orientation imaging. Instead of using a direct tagging approach, we used a recombinant binder connected to a fluorescent protein in a sterically constrained manner that can target specific biomolecules of interest by combining with phage display screening. As an initial test case, we developed POLArIS<sup>act</sup>, which specifically binds to F-actin in living cells. We confirmed that the orientation of F-actin can be monitored by observing cells expressing POLArIS<sup>act</sup> with FPM.

To advance the understanding of MOR's roles in pain modulation, there is a need for high-throughput screening methods of opioids in vitro and high-resolution mapping of opioids in the brain. To fill this need, we designed and characterized a genetically encoded fluorescent reporter, called Single-chain Protein-based Opioid Transmission Indicator Tool for MOR (M-SPOTIT). M-SPOTIT represents a new and unique mechanism for fluorescent reporter design and can detect MOR activation, leaving a persistent green fluorescence mark for image analysis. M-SPOTIT showed an opioid-dependent signal to noise ratio (S/N) up to 12.5 and was able to detect as fast as a 30-second opioid exposure in HEK293T cell culture. Additionally, it showed an opioid-dependent S/N up to 4.6 in neuronal culture and detected fentanyl with an EC<sub>50</sub> of 15 nM.

Although these complex activity patterns suggest a network-like configuration, research so far had little interest in synaptic network formation ability of the sensory neurons. To identify interaction profiles of Dorsal Root Ganglia (DRG) neurons and explore their putative connectivity, we developed an in vitro experimental approach. A double transgenic mouse model, expressing genetically encoded calcium indicator (GECI) in their glutamatergic neurons, was produced. Dissociated DRG cultures from adult mice were prepared with a serum-free protocol and no additional growth factors or cytokines were utilized for neuronal sensitization. DRG neurons were grown on microelectrode arrays (MEA) to induce stimulus-evoked activity with a modality-free stimulation strategy. With an almost single-cell level electrical stimulation, spontaneous and evoked activity of GCaMP6s expressing neurons were detected under confocal microscope. Typical responses were analyzed, and correlated calcium events were detected across individual DRG neurons. Next, correlated responses were successfully blocked by glutamatergic receptor antagonists, which indicated functional synaptic coupling. Immunostaining confirmed the presence of synapses mainly in the axonal terminals, axon-soma junctions and axon-axon intersection sites. Concisely, the results presented here illustrate a new type of neuron-to-neuron interaction in cultured DRG neurons conducted through synapses.

For example, a transient increase in H2O2 has been detected in zebrafish embryos during the first days following fertilization. Furthermore, depleting an important cellular H2O2 source, NADPH oxidase (NOX), impairs nervous system development such as the differentiation, axonal growth, and guidance of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) both in vivo and in vitro. Here, we describe a method for imaging intracellular H2O2 levels in cultured zebrafish neurons and whole larvae during development using the genetically encoded H2O2-specific biosensor, roGFP2-Orp1. This probe can be transiently or stably expressed in zebrafish larvae. Furthermore, the ratiometric readout diminishes the probability of detecting artifacts due to differential gene expression or volume effects. First, we demonstrate how to isolate and culture RGCs derived from zebrafish embryos that transiently express roGFP2-Orp1. Then, we use whole larvae to monitor H2O2 levels at the tissue level. The sensor has been validated by the addition of H2O2. Additionally, this methodology could be used to measure H2O2 levels in specific cell types and tissues by generating transgenic animals with tissue-specific biosensor expression. As zebrafish facilitate genetic and developmental manipulations, the approach demonstrated here could serve as a pipeline to test the role of H2O2 during neuronal and general embryonic development in vertebrates.",

Using this novel probe, we determined and compared mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity and the coupling with cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics in hiPSC-CMs and ACMs. Our data showed that while ACMs displayed a highly coordinated beat-by-beat response in mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> in sync with cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup>, hiPSC-CMs showed high cell-wide variability in mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity that is poorly coordinated with cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup>. We then revealed that mitochondrial-sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) tethering, as well as the inter-mitochondrial network connection, is underdeveloped in hiPSC-CM compared to ACM, which may underlie the observed spatiotemporal decoupling between cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics. Finally, we showed that knockdown of mitofusin-2 (Mfn2), a protein tethering mitochondria and SR, led to reduced cytosolic-mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> coupling in ACMs, albeit to a lesser degree compared to hiPSC-CMs, suggesting that Mfn2 is a potential engineering target for improving mitochondrial-cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> coupling in hiPSC-CMs. Physiological relevance: The present study will advance our understanding of the role of mitochondria in Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling and cycling in CMs, and guide the development of hiPSC-CMs for healing injured hearts.",

        "abstract": "Mitochondrial medicine is an exciting and rapidly evolving field. While the mitochondrial genome is small and differs from the nuclear genome in that it is circular and free of histones, it has been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases, type 2 diabetes, aging and cardiovascular disorders. Currently, there is a lack of efficient treatments for mitochondrial diseases. This has promoted the need for developing an appropriate platform to investigate and target the mitochondrial genome. However, developing these therapeutics requires a model system that enables rapid and effective studying of potential candidate therapeutics. In the past decade, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have become a promising technology for applications in basic science and clinical trials, and have the potential to be transformative for mitochondrial drug development. Engineered iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CM) offer a unique tool to model mitochondrial disorders. Additionally, these cellular models enable the discovery and testing of novel therapeutics and their impact on pathogenic mtDNA variants and dysfunctional mitochondria. Herein, we review recent advances in iPSC-CM models focused on mitochondrial dysfunction often causing cardiovascular diseases. The importance of mitochondrial disease systems biology coupled with genetically encoded NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH sensors is addressed toward developing an <i>in vitro</i> translational approach to establish effective therapies.",

        "abstract": "Eukaryotic cells exploit dynamic and compartmentalized ionic strength to impact a myriad of biological functions such as enzyme activities, protein-protein interactions, and catalytic functions. Herein, we investigated the fluorescence depolarization dynamics of recently developed ionic strength biosensors (mCerulean3-linker-mCitrine) in Hofmeister salt (KCl, NaCl, NaI, and Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>) solutions. The mCerulean3-mCitrine acts as a Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) pair, tethered together by two oppositely charged α-helices in the linker region. We developed a time-resolved fluorescence depolarization anisotropy approach for FRET analyses, in which the donor (mCerulean3) is excited by 425-nm laser pulses, followed by fluorescence depolarization analysis of the acceptor (mCitrine) in KE (lysine-glutamate), arginine-aspartate, and arginine-glutamate ionic strength sensors with variable amino acid sequences. Similar experiments were carried out on the cleaved sensors as well as an E6G2 construct, which has neutral α-helices in the linker region, as a control. Our results show distinct dynamics of the intact and cleaved sensors. Importantly, the FRET efficiency decreases and the donor-acceptor distance increases as the environmental ionic strength increases. Our chemical equilibrium analyses of the collapsed-to-stretched conformational state transition of KE reveal that the corresponding equilibrium constant and standard Gibbs free energy changes are ionic strength dependent. We also tested the existing theoretical models for FRET analyses using steady-state anisotropy, which reveal that the angle between the dipole moments of the donor and acceptor in the KE sensor are sensitive to the ionic strength. These results help establish the time-resolved depolarization dynamics of these genetically encoded donor-acceptor pairs as a quantitative means for FRET analysis, which complement traditional methods such as time-resolved fluorescence for future in vivo studies.",

To non-invasively monitor progression of cell cycle in vivo, a family of genetically encoded fluorescent indicators, FUCCI (fluorescent ubiquitination-based cell cycle indicator), has been developed. Existing versions of FUCCI are based on fluorescent proteins of two or more different colors fused to cell-cycle-dependent degradation motifs. Thus, FUCCI-expressing cells emit light of different colors in different phases providing a robust way to monitor cell cycle progression by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry but limiting the possibility to simultaneously visualize other markers. To overcome this limitation, we developed a single-color variant of FUCCI, called FUCCI-Red, which utilizes two red fluorescent proteins with distinct fluorescence lifetimes, mCherry and mKate2. Similarly to FUCCI, these proteins carry cell cycle-dependent degradation motifs to resolve G1 and S/G2/M phases. We showed utility of FUCCI-Red by visualizing cell cycle progression of cancer cells in 2D and 3D cultures and monitoring development of tumors in vivo by confocal and fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM). Single-channel registration and red-shifted spectra make FUCCI-Red sensor a promising instrument for multiparameter in vivo imaging applications, which was demonstrated by simultaneous detection of cellular metabolic state using endogenous fluorescence in the blue range.",

We developed a genetically encoded probe to identify glutamatergic synaptic vesicles at the levels of both light and electron microscopy (EM) by fusing the mini singlet oxygen generator (miniSOG) probe to an intralumenal loop of the vesicular glutamate transporter-2. We then used a 3D imaging method, serial block-face scanning EM, combined with a deep learning approach for automatic segmentation of labeled synaptic vesicles to assess the subcellular distribution of transporter-defined vesicles at nanometer scale.

Due to importance of understanding the interactions between the epithelium and the microbiota, there is a strong need for developing representative and simple experimental models. Current approaches do not capture the partitioned oxygen environment, require external anaerobic chambers, or are complex. Another major limitation is that with the solutions that can mimic this oxygen environment, the oxygenation level of the epithelial cells is not known, raising the question whether the cells are hypoxic or not. We report standalone microfluidic devices that form a partitioned oxygen environment without the use of an external anaerobic chamber or oxygen scavengers to coculture intestinal epithelial and bacterial cells. By changing the thickness of the device cover, the oxygen tension in the chamber was modulated. We verified the oxygen levels using several tests: microscale oxygen sensitive sensors which were integrated within the devices, immunostaining of Caco-2 cells to determine hypoxia levels, and genetically encoded bacteria to visualize the growth. Collectively, these methods monitored oxygen concentrations in the devices more comprehensively than previous reports and allowed for control of oxygen tension to match the requirements of both intestinal cells and anaerobic bacteria. Our experimental model is supported by the mathematical model that considered diffusion of oxygen into the top chamber. This allowed us to experimentally determine the oxygen consumption rate of the intestinal epithelial cells under perfusion.",

Importantly, lysosomes are refilled by the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). However, it is unclear how TRPML1 function could be modulated by the ER. Here, we deal with this issue in rat primary cortical neurons exposed to different oxygen conditions affecting neuronal survival. Under normoxic conditions, TRPML1: (1) showed a wide distribution within soma and along neuronal processes; (2) was stimulated by the synthetic agonist ML-SA1 and the analog of its endogenous modulator, PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> diC8; (3) its knockdown by siRNA strategy produced an ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> accumulation; (4) co-localized and co-immunoprecipitated with the ER-located Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor stromal interacting molecule 1 (STIM1). In cortical neurons lacking STIM1, ML-SA1 and PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> diC8 failed to induce Ca<sup>2+</sup> release and, more deeply, they induced a negligible Ca<sup>2+</sup> passage through the channel in neurons transfected with the genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator GCaMP3-ML1. Moreover, TRPML1/STIM1 interplay changed at low-oxygen conditions: both proteins were downregulated during the ischemic preconditioning (IPC) while during IPC followed by 1 hour of normoxia, at which STIM1 is upregulated, TRPML1 protein was reduced. However, during oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) followed by reoxygenation, TRPML1 and STIM1 proteins peaked at 8 hours of reoxygenation, when the proteins were co-immunoprecipitated and reactive oxygen species (ROS) hyperproduction was measured in cortical neurons. This may lead to a persistent TRPML1 Ca<sup>2+</sup> release and lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> loss. Collectively, we showed a new modulation exerted by STIM1 on TRPML1 activity that may differently intervene during hypoxia to regulate organellar Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis.",

By fusing a nuclear localization signal to jGCaMP7f, we achieved highly efficient nuclear-specific targeting. Comparing the jGCaMP7f-NLS probe with the previous GCaMP6f-NLS calcium sensor showed clearly that jGCaMP7f-NLS is more sensitive and reverses significantly quicker thereby reflecting rapid nuclear calcium transients in a closely physiological manner. We further confirm that nuclear calcium transients precede nuclear actin polymerization by several seconds. Our data show that calcium-triggered nuclear actin assembly in fibroblasts is independent of the actin nucleating Arp2/3 complex.

Compared to the R-GECO1 indicator in vitro, the purified protein FRCaMP had similar spectral characteristics, brightness, and pH stability but a 1.3-fold lower ΔF/F calcium response and 2.6-fold tighter calcium affinity with K<sub>d</sub> of 441 nM and 2.4-6.6-fold lower photostability.

This process is not only essential for organ development and homeostasis, but also leads to pathological diseases. One form of regulated cell death is ferroptosis, which is an iron-dependent oxidative cell death caused by lipid peroxidation. Although inducing ferroptosis is an emerging anticancer strategy, the molecular mechanism underlying tumor resistance to ferroptotic cell death is still unclear. Here, we show that pirin (PIR), an iron-binding nuclear protein, plays a previously unrecognized role in mediating ferroptosis resistance in human pancreatic cancer cells. The transcription factor NFE2L2 mediates the upregulation of PIR during ferroptosis caused by small-molecule compounds (e.g., erastin or RSL3). PIR is a nuclear redox sensor and regulator, and increasing it limits the oxidative damage of DNA and the subsequent cytoplasmic transport and extracellular release of HMGB1. In contrast, the depletion of PIR initiates HMGB1-dependent autophagy by binding to BECN1, and subsequently promotes ferroptosis by activating ACSL4. Consequently, in cell cultures and xenograft mouse models, blocking PIR signaling enhances ferroptosis-mediated tumor growth suppression. Together, these findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms of autophagy-dependent ferroptosis.",

Current techniques to assess the oxic status of plant cells rely primarily on invasive microoptodes or Clark-type electrodes, which are not optimally suited for experiments that require high spatial and temporal resolution. In this case, a genetically encoded oxygen biosensor is required instead. This article reports the design, test, and optimization of a hypoxia-signaling reporter, based on five-time repeated hypoxia-responsive promoter elements (HRPE) driving the expression of different reporter proteins. Specifically, this study aimed to improve its performance as a reporter of hypoxic conditions by testing the effect of different untranslated regions (UTRs) at the 5' end of the reporter coding sequence. Next, we characterized an optimized version of the <i>HRPE</i> promoter (<i>HRPE-Ω</i>) in terms of hypoxia sensitivity and time responsiveness. We also observed that severe oxygen deficiency counteracted the reporter activity due to inhibition of GFP maturation, which requires molecular oxygen. To overcome this limitation, we therefore employed an oxygen-independent UnaG fluorescent protein-coupled to an O<sub>2</sub>-dependent mCherry fluorophore under the control of the optimized <i>HRPE-Ω</i> promoter. Remarkably, this sensor, provided a different mCherry/UnaG ratiometric output depending on the externally imposed oxygen concentration, providing a solution to distinguish between different degrees of tissue hypoxia. Moreover, a ubiquitously expressed UnaG-mCherry fusion could be used to image oxygen concentrations directly, albeit at a narrow range. The luminescent and fluorescent hypoxia-reporters described here can readily be used to conduct studies that involve anaerobiosis in plants.",

Herein, we developed a genetically encoded Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET)-based nanosensor (FLIP-H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) by sandwiching the regulatory domain (RD) of OxyR between two fluorescent moieties, namely ECFP and mVenus. This nanosensor was pH stable, highly selective to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, and showed insensitivity to other oxidants like superoxide anions, nitric oxide, and peroxynitrite. The FLIP-H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> demonstrated a broad dynamic range and having a binding affinity (Kd) of 247 µM. Expression of sensor protein in living bacterial, yeast, and mammalian cells showed the localization of the sensor in the cytosol. The flux of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> was measured in these live cells using the FLIP-H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> under stress conditions or by externally providing the ligand. Time-dependent FRET-ratio changes were recorded, which correspond to the presence of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Using this sensor, real-time information of the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> level can be obtained non-invasively. Thus, this nanosensor would help to understand the adverse effect of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> on cell physiology and its role in redox signaling.",

Nitrate sensing activates signaling pathways in the plant system that impinges upon, developmental, molecular, metabolic, and physiological responses locally, and globally. To sustain, the high crop productivity and high nutritional value along with the sustainable environment, the study of rate-controlling steps of a metabolic network of N assimilation through fluxomics becomes an attractive strategy. To monitor the flux of nitrate, we developed a non-invasive genetically encoded fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based tool named \"FLIP-NT\" that monitors the real-time uptake of nitrate in the living cells. The developed nanosensor is suitable for real-time monitoring of nitrate flux in living cells at subcellular compartments with high spatio-temporal resolution. The developed FLIP-NT nanosensor was not affected by the pH change and have specificity for nitrate with an affinity constant (<i>K</i> <sub>d</sub>) of ∼5 μM. A series of affinity mutants have also been generated to expand the physiological detection range of the sensor protein with varying <i>K</i> <sub>d</sub> values. It has been found that this sensor successfully detects the dynamics of nitrate fluctuations in bacteria and yeast, without the disruption of cellular organization. This FLIP-NT nanosensor could be a very important tool that will help us to advance the understanding of nitrate signaling.",

For a precise understanding of peptide functions in a stress response, it is important to investigate when and where they are released, how they diffuse, and how they are broken down in the brain. In the past two decades, genetically encoded fluorescent calcium indicators have greatly advanced our knowledge of the functions of specific neuronal activity in regulation of behavioral changes and physiological responses during stress. In addition, various kinds of structural information on G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) for neuropeptides have been revealed. Recently, genetically encoded fluorescent sensors have been developed for detection of neurotransmitters by making use of conformational changes induced by ligand binding. In this review, we summarize the recent and upcoming advances of techniques for detection of neuropeptides and then present several open questions that will be solved by application of recent or upcoming technical advances in detection of neuropeptides in vivo.",

        "abstract": "Visually guided behaviors such as optomotor and optokinetic responses, phototaxis, and prey capture are crucial for survival in zebrafish and become apparent after just a few days of development. Color vision, which in zebrafish is based on a spatially anisotropic tetrachromatic retina, provides an additional important component of world representation driving fundamental larval behaviors. However, little is known about the central nervous system (CNS) circuitry underlying color vision processing downstream of the retina, and its activity correlates with behavior. Here, we used the transparent larva of zebrafish to image CNS neurons and their activity in response to colored visual stimuli. To investigate the processing of chromatic information in the zebrafish larva brain, we mapped with cellular resolution, spectrally responsive neurons in the larva encephalon and spinal cord. We employed the genetically encoded calcium indicator GCaMP6s and two-photon microscopy to image the neuronal activity while performing visual stimulation with spectrally distinct stimuli at wavelengths matching the absorption peaks of the four zebrafish cone types. We observed the presence of a high number of wavelength-selective neurons not only in the optic tectum, but also in all other regions of the CNS, demonstrating that the circuitry involved in processing spectral information and producing color-selective responses extends to the whole CNS. Our measurements provide a map of neurons involved in color-driven responses, revealing that spectral information spreads in all regions of the CNS. This suggests the underlying complexity of the circuits involved and opens the way to their detailed future investigation.",

Many factors, however, including strain differences, sex, prior stress, and reinforcer administration protocols can influence reward responding and DA release. Although previous evidence indicates that access to the home cage can be an effective reinforcer in behavioral tasks, whether this simple environmental manipulation can trigger DA release in the NAc has not been demonstrated. Here, using fiber photometric recordings of in vivo NAc dopamine release from a genetically-encoded DA sensor, we show that the movement of animals from the home cage to a clear, polycarbonate recording chamber evokes little to no DA release following initial exposure whereas returning animals from the recording chamber to a clean, home-like cage or to the home cage robustly triggers the release of DA, comparable in size to that observed with a 10 mg/kg i.p. Cocaine injection in the recording chamber. Although DA release can be evoked in moving mice to a clean cage, this release was significantly augmented when moving animals from the clean cage to the home cage. Our data provide direct evidence that home cage return from a foreign environment results in a biochemical change consistent with that of a rewarding stimulus. This simple environmental manipulation provides a minimally invasive approach to study the reward circuitry underlying an ethologically relevant reinforcer, return to the safe confines of \"home\". The home cage - DA release paradigm may also represent a biomarker-driven paradigm for the evaluation of genetic and experiential events that underlie anhedonic states, characteristic of major mood disorders, and to present new opportunities to identify their treatments.",

The morphology of corneal nerves has been studied extensively. However, corneal nerve function has only been studied in a limited fashion owing to a lack of tools. Here, we present a new system for studying corneal nerve function. Optical imaging was performed on the cornea of excised murine globes taken from a model animal expressing a genetically encoded calcium indicator, GCaMP6f, to record calcium transients. A custom perfusion and imaging chamber for ex vivo murine globes was designed to maintain and stabilize the cornea, while allowing the introduction of chemical stimulation during imaging. Imaging of calcium signals in the ex vivo murine cornea was demonstrated. Strong calcium signals with minimal photobleaching were observed in experiments lasting up to 10 minutes. Concentrated potassium and lidocaine solutions both modulated corneal nerve activity. Similar responses were observed in the same neurons across multiple chemical stimulations, suggesting the feasibility of using chemical stimulations to test the response of the corneal nerves. Our studies suggest that this tool will be of great use for studying functional changes to corneal nerves in response to disease and ocular procedures. This process will enable preclinical testing of new ocular procedures to minimize damage to corneal innervation and therapies for diminished neural function.",

Recently, red and green genetically encoded sensors for DA (dLight, GRAB-DA) were developed and now provide the ability to track release dynamics at a subsecond resolution, with submicromolar affinity and high molecular specificity. Combined with rapid developments in in vivo imaging, these sensors have the potential to transform the field of DA sensing and DA-based drug discovery. When implementing these tools in the laboratory, it is important to consider there is not a 'one-size-fits-all' sensor. Sensor properties, most importantly their affinity and dynamic range, must be carefully chosen to match local DA levels. Molecular specificity, sensor kinetics, spectral properties, brightness, sensor scaffold and pharmacology can further influence sensor choice depending on the experimental question. In this review, we use DA as an example; we briefly summarize old and new techniques to monitor DA release, including DA biosensors. We then outline a map of DA heterogeneity across the brain and provide a guide for optimal sensor choice and implementation based on local DA levels and other experimental parameters. Altogether this review should act as a tool to guide DA sensor choice for end-users.",

While C. albicans is a heme prototroph, we show here that it can also efficiently utilise external heme as a cellular heme source. Using genetically encoded ratiometric fluorescent heme sensors, we show that heme extracted from haemoglobin and free hemin enter the cells with different kinetics. Heme supplied as haemoglobin is taken up via the Common in Fungal Extracellular Membrane (CFEM) hemophore cascade, and reaches the cytoplasm over several hours, whereas entry of free hemin via CFEM-dependent and independent pathways is much faster, less than an hour. To prevent an influx of extracellular heme from reaching toxic levels in the cytoplasm, the cells deploy Hmx1, a heme oxygenase. Hmx1 was previously suggested to be involved in utilisation of haemoglobin and hemin as iron sources, but we find that it is primarily required to prevent heme toxicity. Taken together, the combination of novel heme sensors with genetic analysis revealed new details of the fungal mechanisms of heme import and homeostasis, necessary to balance the uses of heme as essential cofactor and potential iron source against its toxicity.",

Besides, previously used techniques for drug authentication and quantification of small-molecule drugs in blood samples are not the best choice available. The nanobiosensor is based on the FRET (Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer) mechanism, and it is constructed in such a way that it gives a changed FRET output in the presence of digoxin. Two fluorophores, enhanced cyan fluorescent protein (ECFP) and Venus, were attached on either end of the sensory domain - human nuclear receptor ROR-gamma (RORγt). The developed nanobiosensor was named as fluorescent indicator protein for digoxin, (FLIP-digoxin). The ligand binding affinity of FLIP-digoxin was calculated as 425 μM. Affinity mutants of the FLIP-digoxin were also generated to measure digoxin in wide concentration ranges. This sensor offers high-throughput qualitative analysis of digoxin in Digitalis preparations procured from local drug stores. It confirms the authenticity of the preparations through the detection of digoxin. The FLIP-1n was also able to monitor digoxin concentration in serum samples in lesser than 5 min. The nanobiosensor was found pH stable, digoxin-specific, non- interfered by the biological serum species and can perform high throughput screening of the Digitalis powder, infusion and tincture preparations.",

        "abstract": "Understanding how the brain encodes and processes information requires the recording of neural activity that underlies different behaviors. Recent efforts in fluorescent protein engineering have succeeded in developing powerful tools for visualizing neural activity, in general by coupling neural activity to different properties of a fluorescent protein scaffold. Here, we take advantage of a previously unexploited class of reversibly switchable fluorescent proteins to engineer a new type of calcium sensor. We introduce rsCaMPARI, a genetically encoded calcium marker engineered from a reversibly switchable fluorescent protein that enables spatiotemporally precise marking, erasing, and remarking of active neuron populations under brief, user-defined time windows of light exposure. rsCaMPARI photoswitching kinetics are modulated by calcium concentration when illuminating with blue light, and the fluorescence can be reset with violet light. We demonstrate the utility of rsCaMPARI for marking and remarking active neuron populations in freely swimming zebrafish.",

        "abstract": "Zebrafish embryos have been proposed as a cost-effective vertebrate model to study heart function. Many fluorescent genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicators (GECIs) have been developed, but those with ratiometric readout seem more appropriate to image a moving organ such as the heart. Four ratiometric GECIs based on troponin C, TN-XXL, Twitch-1, Twitch-2B, and Twitch-4 were expressed transiently in the heart of zebrafish embryos. Their emission ratio reported the Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels in both the atrium and the ventricle. We measured several kinetic parameters of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients: systolic and diastolic ratio, the amplitude of the systolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> rise, the heart rate, as well as the rise and decay times and slopes. The systolic ratio change decreased in cells expressing high biosensor concentration, possibly caused by Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffering. The GECIs were able to report the effect of nifedipine and propranolol on the heart, which resulted in changes in heart rate, diastolic and systolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels, and Ca<sup>2+</sup> kinetics. As a result, Twitch-1 and Twitch-4 (<i>K</i>d 0.25 and 2.8 µM, respectively) seem the most promising GECIs for generating transgenic zebrafish lines, which could be used for modeling heart disorders, for drug screening, and for cardiotoxicity assessment during drug development.",

        "abstract": "Dysregulation of cellular ribose uptake can be indicative of metabolic abnormalities or tumorigenesis. However, analytical methods are currently limited for quantifying ribose concentration in complex biological samples. Here, we utilize the highly specific recognition of ribose by ribose-binding protein (RBP) to develop a single-protein ribose sensor detectable <i>via</i> a sensitive NMR technique known as hyperpolarized <sup>129</sup>Xe chemical exchange saturation transfer (hyper-CEST). We demonstrate that RBP, with a tunable ribose-binding site and further engineered to bind xenon, enables the quantitation of ribose over a wide concentration range (nM to mM). Ribose binding induces the RBP \"closed\" conformation, which slows Xe exchange to a rate detectable by hyper-CEST. Such detection is remarkably specific for ribose, with the minimal background signal from endogenous sugars of similar size and structure, for example, glucose or ribose-6-phosphate. Ribose concentration was measured for mammalian cell lysate and serum, which led to estimates of low-mM ribose in a HeLa cell line. This highlights the potential for using genetically encoded periplasmic binding proteins such as RBP to measure metabolites in different biological fluids, tissues, and physiologic states.",

Thus, it is of great importance and high challenge to identify novel probes for selectively monitoring Sec over biothiols. In this paper, we proposed a smart strategy which allowed us to develop a lysosome targetable probe for specifically sensing Sec. By restricting weak acidic microenvironment, the probe shows a specific detection for Sec with 85-fold fluorescence enhancement owing to the remaining high activity of Sec at pH 5.0.

Although the activity of both BF cholinergic and glutamatergic neurons correlated with changes in the concentration of adenosine, optogenetic activation of these neurons at physiological firing frequencies showed that glutamatergic neurons contributed much more to the adenosine increase.

To visualize local connections, we previously developed a genetically encoded fluorescent indicator, GRAPHIC, which labels cell-cell contacts by restricting the reconstituted green fluorescent protein (GFP) signal to the contact site. Here, we modify GRAPHIC to give the reconstituted GFP motility within the membrane, to detect cells that make contact with other specific cells. Removal of leucine zipper domains, located between the split GFP fragment and glycophosphatidylinositol anchor domain, allowed GFP reconstituted at the contact site to diffuse throughout the entire plasma membrane, revealing cell morphology. Further, depending on the structural spacers employed, the reconstituted GFP could be selectively targeted to N terminal (NT)- or C terminal (CT)-probe-expressing cells. Using these novel constructs, we demonstrated that we can specifically label NT-probe-expressing cells that made contact with CT-probe-expressing cells in an epithelial cell culture and in Xenopus 8-cell-stage blastomeres. Moreover, we showed that diffusible GRAPHIC (dGRAPHIC) can be used in neuronal circuits to trace neurons that make contact to reveal a connection map. Finally, application in the developing brain demonstrated that the dGRAPHIC signal remained on neurons that had transient contacts during circuit development to reveal the contact history. Altogether, dGRAPHIC is a unique probe that can visualize cells that made specific cell-cell contact.",

A well characterized biosensor for cAMP is the Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based Epac1-camps protein. Pharmacological characterization of newly developed ligands acting at GPCRs often includes numerical quantification of the second messenger amount that was produced. To quantify cellular cAMP concentrations, we bacterially over-expressed and purified Epac1-camps and applied the purified protein in a cell-free detection assay for cAMP in a multi-well format. We found that the biosensor can detect as little as 0.15 pmol of cAMP, and that the sensitivity is not impaired by non-physiological salt concentrations or pH values. Notably, the assay tolerated desiccation and storage of the protein without affecting Epac1-camps cyclic nucleotide sensitivity.

        "abstract": "Intracellular calcium can be monitored by various calcium-specific fluorescent dyes including gene-encoded calcium indicators (GECI). GCaMP is a widely-used GECI that emits green fluorescence proportional to the level of intracellular calcium. However, since many tagging proteins also emit green fluorescence, GCaMP cannot be used with another green fluorescent protein. Therefore, it would be ideal to develop a GECI that has a distinct color profile other than green. In this regard, we developed a novel blue fluorescent calcium indicator modified from GCaMP called Ser<sup>222</sup>-Ala<sup>229</sup>-Cys<sup>330</sup>-BCaMP3. Specifically, a simple threonine to histidine substitution to a green fluorescent Cys<sup>330</sup>-GCaMP3 successfully changed its fluorescence to blue (Cys<sup>330</sup>-BCaMP3, B for blue). Furthermore, a couple of additional amino acid substitutions resulted in more enhanced blue fluorescence intensity. Among other Cys<sup>330</sup>-BCaMP3 variants, it was found that Ser<sup>222</sup>-Ala<sup>229</sup>-Cys<sup>330</sup>-BCaMP3 exhibited the strongest blue fluorescence intensity. When Ser<sup>222</sup>-Ala<sup>229</sup>-Cys<sup>330</sup>-BCaMP3 was co-expressed with TRPA1 - a non-selective cation channel - in HEK293T cells, it showed moderate blue fluorescence. One of the drawbacks of Ser<sup>222</sup>-Ala<sup>229</sup>-Cys<sup>330</sup>-BCaMP3 was that the fluorescence intensity was not enough when cells were cultured under 37°C. However, this limitation was circumvented by lowering cell culture temperature to 28°C, allowing much more enhanced blue fluorescence. Although Ser<sup>222</sup>-Ala<sup>229</sup>-Cys<sup>330</sup>-BCaMP3 mandates further optimization, the present study has found a promising blue fluorescent GECI that is derived from GCaMP3.",

Here, we developed a second-generation excitation ratiometric sensor called rogRFP2 with improved red emission for quantitative live-cell imaging. Using this sensor to measure activity-dependent redox changes in individual cultured neurons, we observed an anticorrelation in which mitochondrial oxidation was accompanied by a concurrent reduction in the cytosol. This behavior was dependent on the activity of Complex I of the mitochondrial electron transport chain and could be modulated by the presence of cocultured astrocytes. We also demonstrated that the red fluorescent rogRFP2 facilitates ratiometric one- and two-photon redox imaging in rat brain slices and Drosophila retinas.

The emerging strategies and remaining tasks surrounding genetically encoded molecules which respond to light as well as the vehicles required to deliver them are discussed.The use of optogenetics in humans would represent a completely new paradigm in medicine and would be associated with unprecedented technical considerations. To be applied for stimulation of neurons in humans, an ideal optogenetic tool would need to be non-immunogenic, highly sensitive, and activatable with red light or near-infrared light (to maximize light penetration while minimizing photodamage). To enable sophisticated levels of neuronal control, the combined use of optogenetic actuators and indicators could enable closed-loop all-optical neuromodulation. Such systems would introduce additional challenges related to spectral orthogonality between actuator and indicator, the need for decision making computational algorithms and requirements for large gene cassettes. As in any gene therapy, the therapeutic efficiency of optogenetics will rely on vector delivery and expression in the appropriate cell type. Although viral vectors such as those based on AAVs are showing great potential in human trials, barriers to their general use remain, including immune responses, delivery/transport, and liver clearance.

In order to determine if and to what extent the function of CrtR, as a metabolite-dependent transcriptional repressor of carotenoid biosynthesis genes responding to GGPP, is conserved among <i>actinobacteria</i>, five CrtR orthologs were characterized in more detail. EMSA assays showed that the CrtR orthologs from <i>Corynebacterium</i><i>callunae</i>, <i>Acidipropionibacterium</i><i>jensenii</i>, <i>Paenarthrobacter</i><i>nicotinovorans</i>, <i>Micrococcus</i><i>luteus</i> and <i>Pseudarthrobacter</i><i>chlorophenolicus</i> bound to the intergenic region between their own gene and the divergently oriented gene, and that GGPP inhibited these interactions.

        "abstract": "Optoanalytical methods based on using genetically encoded bioluminescent enzymes, luciferases, allow one to obtain highly sensitive signals, are non-invasive, and require no external irradiation. Bioluminescence is based on the chemical reaction of oxidation of a low-molecular-weight substrate (luciferin) by atmospheric oxygen, which is catalyzed by an enzyme (luciferase). Relaxation of the luciferin oxidation product from its excited state is accompanied by a release of a quantum of light, which can be detected as an analytical signal. The ability to express luciferase genes in various heterological systems and high quantum yields of luminescence reactions have made these tools rather popular in biology and medicine. Among several naturally available luciferases, a few have been found to be useful for practical application. Luciferase size, the wavelength of its luminescence maximum, enzyme thermostability, optimal pH of the reaction, and the need for cofactors are parameters that may differ for luciferases from different groups of organisms, and this fact directly affects the choice of the application area for each enzyme. It is quite important to overview the whole range of currently available luciferases based on their biochemical properties before choosing one bioluminescent probe suitable for a specific application.",

        "abstract": "To understand the role of intracellular metabolites in cellular processes, it is important to measure the dynamics and fluxes of small molecules in living cells. Although conventional metabolite sensors composed of fluorescent proteins have been made to detect some metabolites, an emerging approach is to use genetically encoded sensors composed of RNA. Because of the ability to rapidly generate metabolite-binding RNA aptamers, RNA-based sensors have the potential to be designed more readily than protein-based sensors. Numerous strategies have been developed to convert the green-fluorescent Spinach or Broccoli fluorogenic RNA aptamers into metabolite-regulated sensors. Nevertheless, red fluorescence is particularly desirable because of the low level of red background fluorescence in cells. However, the red fluorescent variant of the Broccoli aptamer, Red Broccoli, does not exhibit red fluorescence in cells when imaged with its cognate fluorophore. It is not known why Red Broccoli is fluorescent <i>in vitro</i> but not in live mammalian cells. Here, we develop a new fluorophore, OBI (3,5-difluoro-4-hydroxybenzylidene-imidazolinone-2-oxime-1-benzoimidazole), which binds Red Broccoli with high affinity and makes Red Broccoli resistant to thermal unfolding. We show that OBI enables Red Broccoli to be readily detected in live mammalian cells. Furthermore, we show that Red Broccoli can be fused to a <i>S</i>-adenosyl methionine (SAM)-binding aptamer to generate a red fluorescent RNA-based sensor that enables imaging of SAM in live mammalian cells. These results reveal a red fluorescent fluorogenic aptamer that functions in mammalian cells and that can be readily developed into red fluorescent RNA-based sensors.",

        "abstract": "In yeast, adaptation to varying conditions often requires proper regulation of the plasma membrane potential. To determine yeast membrane potential change, optical methods involving potentiometric dyes have been supplemental to the direct electrode-based method. However, the hydrophobic nature of the dyes and their slow distribution across the membrane still limits their utilization. Genetically encoded voltage indicator (GEVI) proteins employed in neuroscience offer a tantalizing alternative for monitoring yeast membrane potential change. In this work, several widely used GEVI proteins were assessed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae for their expression and function as a voltage reporter. Among them, only ArcLight and Accelerated Sensor of Action Potential (ASAP) proteins could be expressed and transported to the plasma membrane. While the voltage-sensing capability was demonstrated for both ArcLight and ASAP, ArcLight fluorescence was sensitive to the intracellular pH change concurrently with the voltage change. Therefore, we established that ASAP is the more suitable GEVI protein for reporting yeast membrane potential change. This voltage-sensing reporter for yeast based on ASAP offers a new effective strategy for real-time optical detection of yeast membrane potential change, which potentially facilitates many areas of yeast research including optimizing growth conditions for industrial use and investigating yeast ion transport system.",

        "abstract": "Changes in transcellular bioelectrical patterns are known to play important roles during developmental and regenerative processes. The Drosophila follicular epithelium has proven to be an appropriate model system for studying the mechanisms by which bioelectrical signals emerge and act. Fluorescent indicator dyes in combination with various inhibitors of ion-transport mechanisms have been used to investigate the generation of membrane potentials (V<sub>mem</sub>) and intracellular pH (pH<sub>i</sub>). Both parameters as well as their anteroposterior and dorsoventral gradients were affected by the inhibitors which, in addition, led to alterations of microfilament and microtubule patterns equivalent to those observed during follicle-cell differentiation. We expressed two genetically-encoded fluorescent sensors for V<sub>mem</sub> and pH<sub>i</sub>, ArcLight and pHluorin-Moesin, in the follicular epithelium of Drosophila. By means of the respective inhibitors, we obtained comparable effects on V<sub>mem</sub> and/or pH<sub>i</sub> as previously described for V<sub>mem</sub>- and pH<sub>i</sub>-sensitive fluorescent dyes. In a RNAi-knockdown screen, five genes of ion-transport mechanisms and gap-junction subunits were identified exerting influence on ovary development and/or oogenesis. Loss of ovaries or small ovaries were the results of soma knockdowns of the innexins inx1 and inx3, and of the DEG/ENaC family member ripped pocket (rpk). Germline knockdown of rpk also resulted in smaller ovaries. Soma knockdown of the V-ATPase-subunit vha55 caused size-reduced ovaries with degenerating follicles from stage 10A onward. In addition, soma knockdown of the open rectifier K<sup>+</sup>channel 1 (ork1) resulted in a characteristic round-egg phenotype with altered microfilament and microtubule organisation in the follicular epithelium. The genetic tool box of Drosophila provides means for a refined and extended analysis of bioelectrical phenomena. Tissue-specifically expressed V<sub>mem</sub>- and pH<sub>i</sub>-sensors exhibit some practical advantages compared to fluorescent indicator dyes. Their use confirms that the ion-transport mechanisms targeted by inhibitors play important roles in the generation of bioelectrical signals. Moreover, modulation of bioelectrical signals via RNAi-knockdown of genes coding for ion-transport mechanisms and gap-junction subunits exerts influence on crucial processes during ovary development and results in cytoskeletal changes and altered follicle shape. Thus, further evidence amounts for bioelectrical regulation of developmental processes via the control of both signalling pathways and cytoskeletal organisation.",

Current approaches do not allow detection of the lactate/pyruvate ratio in a single readout with high spatial/temporal resolution in living systems. Using a Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based screening strategy, we found that the orphan transcriptional factor <i>LutR</i> from <i>Bacillus licheniformis</i> is an endogenous sensor of the lactate/pyruvate ratio, suitable for use as a binding moiety to develop a lactate/pyruvate ratio FRET-based genetically encoded indicator, Lapronic. The sensitivity of the indicator to lactate and pyruvate was characterized through changes in the fluorescence FRET ratio and validated with isothermal titration calorimetry. Lapronic was insensitive to physiological pH and temperature and did not respond to structurally related molecules acetate and β-hydroxybutyrate or cofactors NAD<sup>+</sup> and NADH. Lapronic was expressed in HEK 293 cells showing a homogeneous cytosolic localization and was also targeted to the mitochondrial matrix. A calibration protocol was designed to quantitatively assess the lactate/pyruvate ratio in intact mammalian cells. Purified protein from <i>Escherichia coli</i> showed robust stability over time and was found suitable for lactate/pyruvate ratio detection in biological samples. We envision that Lapronic will be of practical interest for basic and applied research.",

Little is known about whether and how Orai1 channel activity may vary between individual puncta. Previously, we developed and validated optical recording of Orai channel activity, using genetically encoded Ca2+ indicators fused to Orai1 or Orai3 N or C termini. We have now combined total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy with whole-cell recording to map functional properties of channels at individual puncta. After Ca2+ store depletion in HEK cells cotransfected with mCherry-STIM1 and Orai1-GCaMP6f, Orai1-GCaMP6f fluorescence increased progressively with increasingly negative test potentials and robust responses could be recorded from individual puncta. Cell-wide fluorescence half-rise and -fall times during steps to -100 mV test potential indicated probe response times of <50 ms. The in situ Orai1-GCaMP6f affinity for Ca2+ was 620 nM, assessed by monitoring fluorescence using buffered Ca2+ solutions in \"unroofed\" cells. Channel activity and temporal activation profile were tracked in individual puncta using image maps and automated puncta identification and recording. Simultaneous measurement of mCherry-STIM1 fluorescence uncovered an unexpected gradient in STIM1/Orai1 ratio that extends across the cell surface. Orai1-GCaMP6f channel activity was found to vary across the cell, with inactive channels occurring in the corners of cells where the STIM1/Orai1 ratio was lowest; low-activity channels typically at edges displayed a slow activation phase lasting hundreds of milliseconds. Puncta with high STIM1/Orai1 ratios exhibited a range of channel activity that appeared unrelated to the stoichiometric requirements for gating. These findings demonstrate functional heterogeneity of Orai1 channel activity between individual puncta and establish a new experimental platform that facilitates systematic comparisons between puncta composition and activity.",

Because of these advantages, NIR fluorescent proteins (FPs) are in high demand for in vivo imaging. Nevertheless, application of NIR FPs such as iRFP is still limited due to their dimness in mammalian cells. In contrast to GFP and its variants, iRFP requires biliverdin (BV) as a chromophore. The dimness of iRFP is at least partly due to rapid reduction of BV by biliverdin reductase-A (BLVRA). Here, we established biliverdin reductase-a knockout (Blvra<sup>-/-</sup>) mice to increase the intracellular BV concentration and, thereby, to enhance iRFP fluorescence intensity. As anticipated, iRFP fluorescence intensity was significantly increased in all examined tissues of Blvra<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Similarly, the genetically encoded calcium indicator NIR-GECO1, which is engineered based on another NIR FP, mIFP, exhibited a marked increase in fluorescence intensity in mouse embryonic fibroblasts derived from Blvra<sup>-/-</sup> mice. We expanded this approach to an NIR light-sensing optogenetic tool, the BphP1-PpsR2 system, which also requires BV as a chromophore. Again, deletion of the Blvra gene markedly enhanced the light response in HeLa cells.

        "abstract": "Intratumoural hypoxia is a common characteristic of malignant treatment-resistant cancers. However, hypoxia-modification strategies for the clinic remain elusive. To date, little is known on the behaviour of individual hypoxic tumour cells in their microenvironment. To explore this issue in a spatial and temporally controlled manner, we developed a genetically encoded sensor by fusing the O<sub>2</sub>-labile hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) protein to eGFP and a tamoxifen-regulated Cre recombinase. Under normoxic conditions, HIF-1α is degraded but, under hypoxia, the HIF-1α-GFP-Cre-ER<sup>T2</sup> fusion protein is stabilised and in the presence of tamoxifen activates a tdTomato reporter gene that is constitutively expressed in hypoxic progeny. We visualise the random distribution of hypoxic tumour cells from hypoxic or necrotic regions and vascularised areas using immunofluorescence and intravital microscopy. Once tdTomato expression is induced, it is stable for at least 4 weeks. Using this system, we could show <i>in vivo</i> that the post-hypoxic cells were more proliferative than non-labelled cells. Our results demonstrate that single-cell lineage tracing of hypoxic tumour cells can allow visualisation of their behaviour in living tumours using intravital microscopy.

In an effort to sustain the steady progression toward ever-improved GECIs, we undertook the development of a new GECI based on the bright monomeric GFP, mNeonGreen (mNG).

        "abstract": "Nature employs a limited number of genetically encoded axial ligands to control diverse heme enzyme activities. Deciphering the functional significance of these ligands requires a quantitative understanding of how their electron-donating capabilities modulate the structures and reactivities of the iconic ferryl intermediates compounds I and II. However, probing these relationships experimentally has proven to be challenging as ligand substitutions accessible via conventional mutagenesis do not allow fine tuning of electron donation and typically abolish catalytic function. Here, we exploit engineered translation components to replace the histidine ligand of cytochrome <i>c</i> peroxidase (C<i>c</i>P) by a less electron-donating <i>N</i> <sub>δ</sub>-methyl histidine (Me-His) with little effect on the enzyme structure. The rate of formation (<i>k</i> <sub>1</sub>) and the reactivity (<i>k</i> <sub>2</sub>) of compound I are unaffected by ligand substitution. In contrast, proton-coupled electron transfer to compound II (<i>k</i> <sub>3</sub>) is 10-fold slower in C<i>c</i>P Me-His, providing a direct link between electron donation and compound II reactivity, which can be explained by weaker electron donation from the Me-His ligand (\"the push\") affording an electron-deficient ferryl oxygen with reduced proton affinity (\"the pull\"). The deleterious effects of the Me-His ligand can be fully compensated by introducing a W51F mutation designed to increase \"the pull\" by removing a hydrogen bond to the ferryl oxygen. Analogous substitutions in ascorbate peroxidase lead to similar activity trends to those observed in C<i>c</i>P, suggesting that a common mechanistic strategy is employed by enzymes using distinct electron transfer pathways.

Today, major efforts are devoted toward optimizing red-emitting [red fluorescent protein (RFP)-based] GECIs (R-GECI), as these provide several advantages over GFP-based reporters, for instance, increased imaging depth, reduced photodamage by longer imaging wavelengths and, in principle, are better suited for use with prevalent blue-absorbing optogenetic tools (e.g., channelrhodopsin). However, excessive fluorescence from intersecting neighboring cells in very dense tissues, notably the brain, hinders the ability to collect signals from single cells and their processes. This challenge can be addressed by photoactivatable (PA) fluorescent proteins that can be rendered fluorescent <i>on demand</i> by user-defined targeted light. This allows activation and, thereby, collection of fluorescent signals exclusively from desired cells and their processes, while leaving all neighboring cells in the dark (i.e., non-fluorescent). Nevertheless, there are no PA R-GECIs. Here, we sought to develop PA-R-GECIs.

To directly compare global gene expression of hPSC-PCs with developing mouse PCs, we used translating ribosomal affinity purification (TRAP). As a first step, we used <i>Tg(Pcp2-L10a-Egfp)</i> TRAP mice to profile actively transcribed genes in developing postnatal mouse PCs and used metagene projection to identify the most salient patterns of PC gene expression over time. We then created a transgenic <i>Pcp2</i>-<i>L10a-Egfp</i> TRAP hPSC line to profile gene expression in differentiating hPSC-PCs, finding that the key gene expression pathways of differentiated hPSC-PCs most closely matched those of late juvenile mouse PCs (P21). Comparative bioinformatics identified classical PC gene signatures as well as novel mitochondrial and autophagy gene pathways during the differentiation of both mouse and human PCs. In addition, we identified genes expressed in hPSC-PCs but not mouse PCs and confirmed protein expression of a novel human PC gene, CD40LG, expressed in both hPSC-PCs and native human cerebellar tissue.

Despite being strongly associated with genetic alterations, wide variation of disease penetrance, expressivity and hallmarks of progression complicate treatment. We aimed to characterize different human isogenic cellular models of HCM bearing patient-relevant mutations to clarify genetic causation and disease mechanisms, hence facilitating the development of effective therapeutics. We directly compared the p.β-MHC-R453C and p.ACTC1-E99K HCM-associated mutations in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) and their healthy isogenic counterparts, generated using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing technology. By harnessing several state-of-the-art HCM phenotyping techniques, these mutations were investigated to identify similarities and differences in disease progression and hypertrophic signaling pathways, towards establishing potential targets for pharmacological treatment. CRISPR/Cas9 knock-in of the genetically-encoded calcium indicator R-GECO1.0 to the AAVS1 locus into these disease models resulted in calcium reporter lines. Confocal line scan analysis identified calcium transient arrhythmias and intracellular calcium overload in both models. The use of optogenetics and 2D/3D contractility assays revealed opposing phenotypes in the two mutations. Gene expression analysis highlighted upregulation of CALM1, CASQ2 and CAMK2D, and downregulation of IRF8 in p.β-MHC-R453C mutants, whereas the opposite changes were detected in p.ACTC1-E99K mutants. Contrasting profiles of nuclear translocation of NFATc1 and MEF2 between the two HCM models suggest differential hypertrophic signaling pathway activation. Calcium transient abnormalities were rescued with combination of dantrolene and ranolazine, whilst mavacamten reduced the hyper-contractile phenotype of p.ACTC1-E99K hiPSC-CMs. Our data show that hypercontractility and molecular signaling within HCM are not uniform between different gene mutations, suggesting that a 'one-size fits all' treatment underestimates the complexity of the disease. Understanding where the similarities (arrhythmogenesis, bioenergetics) and differences (contractility, molecular profile) lie will allow development of therapeutics that are directed towards common mechanisms or tailored to each disease variant, hence providing effective patient-specific therapy.",

One cardinal aspect of lysosomal (dys)function is lysosomal acidification in which defects trigger lysosomal stress signaling and defects in proteolytic capacity. We have developed a genetically encoded ratiometric probe to measure lysosomal pH coupled with a purification tag to efficiently purify lysosomes for both proteomic and <i>in vitro</i> evaluation of their function. Using our probe, we showed that lysosomal pH is remarkably stable over a period of days in a variety of cell types. Additionally, this probe can be used to determine that lysosomal stress signaling <i>via</i> TFEB is uncoupled from gross changes in lysosomal pH. Finally, we demonstrated that while overexpression of ARL8B GTPase causes striking alkalinization of peripheral lysosomes in HEK293 T cells, peripheral lysosomes <i>per se</i> are no less acidic than juxtanuclear lysosomes in our cell lines.<b>Abbreviations:</b> ARL8B: ADP ribosylation factor like GTPase 8B; ATP: adenosine triphosphate; ATP5F1B/ATPB: ATP synthase F1 subunit beta; ATP6V1A: ATPase H+ transporting V1 subunit A; Baf: bafilomycin A<sub>1</sub>; BLOC-1: biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles complex 1; BSA: bovine serum albumin; Cos7: African green monkey kidney fibroblast-like cell line; CQ: chloroquine; CTSB: cathepsin B; CYCS: cytochrome c, somatic; DAPI: 4',6-diamidino -2- phenylindole; DIC: differential interference contrast; DIV: days <i>in vitro</i>; DMEM: Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium;‎ E8: embryonic day 8; EEA1: early endosome antigen 1; EGTA: ethylene glycol-bis(β-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid; ER: endoplasmic reticulum; FBS: fetal bovine serum; FITC: fluorescein isothiocyanate; GABARAPL2: GABA type A receptor associated protein like 2; GAPDH: glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; GOLGA2/GM130: golgin A2; GTP: guanosine triphosphate; HEK293T: human embryonic kidney 293 cells, that expresses a mutant version of the SV40 large T antigen; HeLa: Henrietta Lacks-derived cell; HEPES: 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid; HRP: horseradish peroxidase; IGF2R/ciM6PR: insulin like growth factor 2 receptor; LAMP1/2: lysosomal associated membrane protein 1/2; LMAN2/VIP36: lectin, mannose binding 2; MAP1LC3/LC3: microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3; MTORC1: mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase complex 1; PCR: polymerase chain reaction; PDL: poly-d-lysine; <i>PGK1p</i>: promotor from human phosphoglycerate kinase 1; PIKFYVE: phosphoinositide kinase, FYVE-type zinc finger containing; PPT1/CLN1: palmitoyl-protein thioesterase 1; RPS6KB1/p70: ribosomal protein S6 kinase B1; STAT3: signal transducer and activator of transcription 3; TAX1BP1: Tax1 binding protein 1; TFEB: transcription factor EB; TGN: trans-Golgi network; TGOLN2/TGN46: trans-Golgi network protein 2; TIRF: total internal reflection fluorescence; TMEM106B: transmembrane protein 106B; TOR: target of rapamycin; TRPM2: transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily M member 2; V-ATPase: vacuolar-type proton-translocating ATPase; VPS35: VPS35 retromer complex component.",

ABA rapidly increases FRET efficiency in <i>N. benthamiana</i> leaf cells and <i>Arabidopsis</i> guard cells.

        "abstract": "Linking neural circuitry to behavior by mapping active neurons <i>in vivo</i> is a challenge. Both genetically encoded calcium indicators (GECIs) and intermediate early genes (IEGs) have been used to pinpoint active neurons during a stimulus or behavior but have drawbacks such as limiting the movement of the organism, requiring <i>a priori</i> knowledge of the active region or having poor temporal resolution. Calcium-modulated photoactivatable ratiometric integrator (CaMPARI) was engineered to overcome these spatial-temporal challenges. CaMPARI is a photoconvertible protein that only converts from green to red fluorescence in the presence of high calcium concentration and 405 nm light. This allows the experimenter to precisely mark active neurons within defined temporal windows. The photoconversion can then be quantified by taking the ratio of the red fluorescence to the green. CaMPARI promises the ability to trace active neurons during a specific stimulus; however, CaMPARI's uses in adult <i>Drosophila</i> have been limited to photoconversion during fly immobilization. Here, we demonstrate a method that allows photoconversion of multiple freely-moving intact adult flies during a stimulus. Flies were placed in a dish with filter paper wet with acetic acid (pH = 2) or neutralized acetic acid (pH = 7) and exposed to photoconvertible light (60 mW) for 30 min (500 ms on, 200 ms off). Immediately following photoconversion, whole flies were fixed and imaged by confocal microscopy. The red:green ratio was quantified for the DC4 glomerulus, a bundle of neurons expressing <i>Ir64a</i>, an ionotropic receptor that senses acids in the <i>Drosophila</i> antennal lobe. Flies exposed to acetic acid showed 1.3-fold greater photoconversion than flies exposed to neutralized acetic acid. This finding was recapitulated using a more physiological stimulus of apple cider vinegar. These results indicate that CaMPARI can be used to label neurons in intact, freely-moving adult flies and will be useful for identifying the circuitry underlying complex behaviors.",

Although previous studies demonstrated the potential for using 7-HCAA as an acceptor for tryptophan, this approach has not yet been explored within a single protein containing multiple tryptophan residues. A structure-based analysis of a hexokinase enzyme with multiple native tryptophan residues identified glutamate 50 as a potential site of 7-HCAA incorporation; Glu50 moves closer to the native tryptophans upon substrate binding. Substitution of 7-HCAA at residue 50 led to an increase in FRET efficiency in the presence of the substrate; this effect was not observed in a control protein where no change in distance between 7-HCAA and the native tryptophans occurs on substrate binding. This system was then used to directly observe differences in binding affinity of the hexokinase that occur at a number of pH values. Our approach builds on previous research in that it eliminates the need for the incorporation of multiple fNCAAs or fluorescent labels within a target protein and can be used to study substrate binding with native ligands. As such, it serves to expand the versatility of FRET-based techniques.",

Genetically encoded RNA-based sensors are emerging powerful tools for this purpose. However, it was challenging to use these sensors to precisely determine the intracellular concentrations of target analytes. To solve this problem, we have recently developed ratiometric sensors using an orthogonal pair of RNA/fluorophore conjugates: Broccoli/DFHBI-1T (3,5-difluoro-4-hydroxybenzylidene-1-trifluoroethyl-imidazolinone) and DNB (dinitroaniline-binding aptamer)/SR-DN (sulforhodamine B-dinitroaniline). The cellular DNB-to-Broccoli fluorescence intensity ratio can be directly applied to quantify the target concentrations at the single-cell level. Unfortunately, due to the instability of the SR-DN dye, this ratiometric sensor is difficult to use for monitoring target dynamics. Herein, by replacing SR-DN with a stable TMR (tetramethylrhodamine)-DN dye, we developed a ratiometric sensor system based on Broccoli/DFHBI-1T and DNB/TMR-DN, which can be used for dynamic imaging in living cells. We believe these advanced genetically encoded ratiometric sensors can be widely used for intracellular studies of various target analytes.",

        "abstract": "Genetically encoded calcium indicators (GECIs) have become a widespread tool for the visualization of neuronal activity. As compared to popular GCaMP GECIs, the FGCaMP indicator benefits from calmodulin and M13-peptide from the fungi <i>Aspergillus niger</i> and <i>Aspergillus fumigatus</i>, which prevent its interaction with the intracellular environment. However, FGCaMP exhibits a two-phase fluorescence behavior with the variation of calcium ion concentration, has moderate sensitivity in neurons (as compared to the GCaMP6s indicator), and has not been fully characterized in vitro and in vivo. To address these limitations, we developed an enhanced version of FGCaMP, called FGCaMP7. FGCaMP7 preserves the ratiometric phenotype of FGCaMP, with a 3.1-fold larger ratiometric dynamic range in vitro. FGCaMP7 demonstrates 2.7- and 8.7-fold greater photostability compared to mEGFP and mTagBFP2 fluorescent proteins in vitro, respectively. The ratiometric response of FGCaMP7 is 1.6- and 1.4-fold higher, compared to the intensiometric response of GCaMP6s, in non-stimulated and stimulated neuronal cultures, respectively. We reveal the inertness of FGCaMP7 to the intracellular environment of HeLa cells using its truncated version with a deleted M13-like peptide; in contrast to the similarly truncated variant of GCaMP6s. We characterize the crystal structure of the parental FGCaMP indicator. Finally, we test the in vivo performance of FGCaMP7 in mouse brain using a two-photon microscope and an NVista miniscope; and in zebrafish using two-color ratiometric confocal imaging.",

The FLIP-SP can measure the level of the sulfate in live cells. This sensor was constructed by the fusion of fluorescent proteins at the N- and C-terminus of sulfate binding protein (sbp). The FLIP-SP is highly specific to sulfate, and showed pH stability. Real-time monitoring of the level of sulfate in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells showed sensor bio-compatibility with living cells.

Catechin is known for its positive role in anticancerous activity, extracellular matrix degradation, cell death regulation, diabetes, and other related disorders. As a result of enormous interest in and great demand for catechin, its biosynthesis using metabolic engineering has become the subject of concentrated research with the aim of enhancing (+)-catechin production. Metabolic flux is an essential concept in the practice of metabolic engineering as it helps in the identification of the regulatory element of a biosynthetic pathway. In the present study, an attempt was made to analyze the metabolic flux of the (+)-catechin biosynthesis pathway in order to decipher the regulatory element of this pathway. Firstly, a genetically encoded fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based nanosensor (FLIP-Cat, fluorescence indicator protein for (+)-catechin) was developed for real-time monitoring of (+)-catechin flux. <i>In vitro</i> characterization of the purified protein of the nanosensor showed that the nanosensor was pH stable and (+)-catechin specific. Its calculated <i>K</i><sub>d</sub> was 139 µM. The nanosensor also performed real-time monitoring of (+)-catechin in bacterial cells. In the second step of this study, an entire (+)-catechin biosynthesis pathway was constructed and expressed in <i>E. coli</i> in two sets of plasmid constructs: pET26b-PT7-rbs-PAL-PT7-rbs-4CL-PT7-rbs-CHS-PT7-rbs-CHI and pET26b-T7-rbs-F3H-PT7-rbs- DFR-PT7-rbs-LCR. The <i>E. coli</i> harboring the FLIP-Cat was transformed with these plasmid constructs. The metabolic flux analysis of (+)-catechin was carried out using the FLIP-Cat. The FLIP-Cat successfully monitored the flux of catechin after adding tyrosine, 4-coumaric acid, 4-coumaroyl CoA, naringenin chalcone, naringenin, dihydroquercetin, and leucocyanidin, individually, with the bacterial cells expressing the nanosensor as well as the genes of the (+)-catechin biosynthesis pathway. Dihydroflavonol reductase (DFR) was identified as the main regulatory element of the (+)-catechin biosynthesis pathway. Information about this regulatory element of the (+)-catechin biosynthesis pathway can be used for manipulating the (+)-catechin biosynthesis pathway using a metabolic engineering approach to enhance production of (+)-catechin.",

        "abstract": "Synapses are highly compartmentalized functional units that operate independently on each other. In Huntington's disease (HD) and other neurodegenerative disorders, this independence might be compromised due to insufficient glutamate clearance and the resulting spill-in and spill-out effects. Altered astrocytic coverage of the presynaptic terminals and/or dendritic spines as well as a reduced size of glutamate transporter clusters at glutamate release sites have been implicated in the pathogenesis of diseases resulting in symptoms of dys-/hyperkinesia. However, the mechanisms leading to the dysfunction of glutamatergic synapses in HD are not well understood. Improving and applying synapse imaging we have obtained data shedding new light on the mechanisms impeding the initiation of movements. Here, we describe the principle elements of a relatively inexpensive approach to achieve single synapse resolution by using the new genetically encoded ultrafast glutamate sensor iGluu, wide-field optics, a scientific CMOS (sCMOS) camera, a 473 nm laser and a laser positioning system to evaluate the state of corticostriatal synapses in acute slices from age appropriate healthy or diseased mice. Glutamate transients were constructed from single or multiple pixels to obtain estimates of i) glutamate release based on the maximal elevation of the glutamate concentration [Glu] next to the active zone and ii) glutamate uptake as reflected in the time constant of decay (TauD) of the perisynaptic [Glu]. Differences in the resting bouton size and contrasting patterns of short-term plasticity served as criteria for the identification of corticostriatal terminals as belonging to the intratelencephalic (IT) or the pyramidal tract (PT) pathway. Using these methods, we discovered that in symptomatic HD mice ~40% of PT-type corticostriatal synapses exhibited insufficient glutamate clearance, suggesting that these synapses might be at risk to excitotoxic damage. The results underline the usefulness of TauD as a biomarker of dysfunctional synapses in Huntington mice with a hypokinetic phenotype.",

The so-called \"safe value\" of the BLL seems to unreliably represent the secure threshold for children. In general, lead's underlying toxicological mechanism remains unclear and needs to be elucidated.

We combined Met-lead with the <i>UAS-GAL4</i> system to the sensor protein specifically expressed within certain regions of fly brains. Using a suitable imaging platform, including a fast epifluorescent or confocal laser-scanning/two-photon microscope with high resolution, we recorded the changes in lead content inside fly brains ex vivo and in vivo and at different life stages. The blood-brain barrier was found to play an important role in the protection of neurons in the brain against damage due to the heavy metal lead, either through food or microinjection into the abdomen.

        "abstract": "Information processing and memory formation in the brain relies on release of the main excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate from presynaptic axonal specialisations. The classical Hebbian paradigm of synaptic memory, long-term potentiation (LTP) of transmission, has been widely associated with an increase in the postsynaptic receptor current. Whether and to what degree LTP induction also enhances presynaptic glutamate release has been the subject of debate. Here, we took advantage of the recently developed genetically encoded optical sensors of glutamate (iGluSnFR) to monitor its release at CA3-CA1 synapses in acute hippocampal slices, before and after the induction of LTP. We attempted to trace release events at multiple synapses simultaneously, by using two-photon excitation imaging in fast frame-scanning mode. We thus detected a significant increase in the average iGluSnFR signal during potentiation, which lasted for up to 90 min. This increase may reflect an increased amount of released glutamate or, alternatively, reduced glutamate binding to high-affinity glutamate transporters that compete with iGluSnFR.",

        "abstract": "Selenium is a trace element for most organisms; its deficiency and excess are detrimental. Selenium beneficial effects are mainly due to the role of the 21<sup>st</sup> genetically encoded amino acid selenocysteine (Sec). Selenium also exerts Sec-independent beneficial effects. Its harmful effects are thought to be mainly due to non-specific incorporation in protein synthesis. Yet the selenium response in animals is poorly understood. In <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>, Sec is genetically incorporated into a single selenoprotein. Similar to mammals, a 20-fold excess of the optimal selenium requirement is harmful. Sodium selenite (Na<sub>2</sub>SeO<sub>3</sub>) excess causes development retardation, impaired growth, and neurodegeneration of motor neurons. To study the organismal response to selenium we performed a genetic screen for <i>C. elegans</i> mutants that are resistant to selenite. We isolated non-sense and missense <i>egl-9/EGLN</i> mutants that confer robust resistance to selenium. In contrast, <i>hif-1</i>/<i>HIF</i> null mutant was highly sensitive to selenium, establishing a role for this transcription factor in the selenium response. We showed that EGL-9 regulates HIF-1 activity through VHL-1, and identified CYSL-1 as a key sensor that transduces the selenium signal. Finally, we showed that the key enzymes involved in sulfide and sulfite stress (sulfide quinone oxidoreductase and sulfite oxidase) are not required for selenium resistance. In contrast, knockout strains in the persulfide dioxygenase ETHE-1 and the sulfurtransferase MPST-7 affect the organismal response to selenium. In sum, our results identified a transcriptional pathway as well as enzymes possibly involved in the organismal selenium response.",

We therefore expressed a low affinity Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator (ER-GCaMP6-150) in the ER, and measured its fluorescence both in dissociated ommatidia and <i>in vivo</i> from intact flies of both sexes. Blue excitation light induced a rapid (tau ∼0.8 s), PLC-dependent decrease in fluorescence, representing depletion of ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores, followed by a slower decay, typically reaching ∼50% of initial dark-adapted levels, with significant depletion occurring under natural levels of illumination. The ER stores refilled in the dark within 100-200 s. Both rapid and slow store depletion were largely unaffected in InsP<sub>3</sub> receptor mutants, but were much reduced in <i>trp</i> mutants. Strikingly, rapid (but not slow) depletion of ER stores was blocked by removing external Na<sup>+</sup> and in mutants of the Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchanger, CalX, which we immuno-localized to ER membranes in addition to its established localization in the plasma membrane.

However, most of them are based on the EGFP protein and have similar molecular brightnesses. The NTnC indicator, which is composed of the mNeonGreen fluorescent protein with the insertion of troponin C, has higher brightness as compared to EGFP-based GECIs, but shows a limited inverted response with an ΔF/F of 1. By insertion of a calmodulin/M13-peptide pair into the mNeonGreen protein, we developed a green GECI called NCaMP7. In vitro, NCaMP7 showed positive response with an ΔF/F of 27 and high affinity (K<sub>d</sub> of 125 nM) to calcium ions. NCaMP7 demonstrated a 1.7-fold higher brightness and similar calcium-association/dissociation dynamics compared to the standard GCaMP6s GECI in vitro. According to fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments, the NCaMP7 design partially prevented interactions of NCaMP7 with the intracellular environment. The NCaMP7 crystal structure was obtained at 1.75 Å resolution to uncover the molecular basis of its calcium ions sensitivity. The NCaMP7 indicator retained a high and fast response when expressed in cultured HeLa and neuronal cells. Finally, we successfully utilized the NCaMP7 indicator for in vivo visualization of grating-evoked and place-dependent neuronal activity in the visual cortex and the hippocampus of mice using a two-photon microscope and an NVista miniscope, respectively.",

Here, we modified this technique to allow successful transfection of acute brain slices, followed by measurement of neuronal activity within a few hours. We established biolistic transfection of murine acute cortical slices to measure calcium signals. Acute slices are mounted on plasma/thrombin coagulate and transfected with a calcium sensor. Imaging can be performed within 4 h post transfection without affecting cell viability. Four hours after GCaMP6s transfection, acute slices display remarkable fluorescent protein expression level allowing to study spontaneous activity and receptor pharmacology. While optimal gas pressure (150 psi) and gold particle size used (1 μm) confirm previously published protocols, the amount of 5 μg DNA was found to be optimal for particle coating. The major advantage of this technique is the rapid disposition of acute slices for calcium imaging. No transgenic GECI expressing animals or OTC for long periods are required. In acute slices, network interaction and connectivity are preserved. The method allows to obtain physiological readouts within 4 h, before functional tissue modifications might come into effect. Limitations of this technique are random transfection, low expression efficiency when using specific promotors, and preclusion or genetic manipulations that require a prolonged time before physiological changes become measurable, such as expression of recombinant proteins that require transport to distant subcellular localizations.

        "abstract": "Multiple intra-cellular signalling pathways rely on calcium and 3'-5' cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) to act as secondary messengers. This is especially true in cardiomyocytes which act as the force-producing units of the cardiac muscle and are required to react rapidly to environmental stimuli. The specificity of functional responses within cardiomyocytes and other cell types is produced by the organellar compartmentation of both calcium and cAMP. In this review, we assess the role of molecular localisation and relative contribution of active and passive processes in producing compartmentation. Active processes comprise the creation and destruction of signals, whereas passive processes comprise the release or sequestration of signals. Cardiomyocytes display a highly articulated membrane structure which displays significant cell-to-cell variability. Special attention is paid to the way in which cell membrane caveolae and the transverse-axial tubule system allow molecular localisation. We explore the effects of cell maturation, pathology and regional differences in the organisation of these processes. The subject of signal compartmentation has had a significant amount of attention within the cardiovascular field and has undergone a revolution over the past two decades. Advances in the area have been driven by molecular imaging using fluorescent dyes and genetically encoded constructs based upon fluorescent proteins. We also explore the use of scanning probe microscopy in the area. These techniques allow the analysis of molecular compartmentation within specific organellar compartments which gives researchers an entirely new perspective.",

In parallel, we have applied these synthetic devices to enable light-inducible gating of calcium channels, conformational switch, dynamic protein-microtubule interactions and assembly of membrane contact sites in a reversible manner. Our optogenetic engineering approach can be broadly applied to aid the mechanistic dissection of cell signaling, as well as non-invasive interrogation of physiological processes with high precision.",

Here, we report the development of a molecular SenVitAL containing enhanced cyan fluorescent protein (ECFP) and venus as FRET pair to improve the FRET efficiency for optical imaging and screening of already developed sensor by our group. The sensor is the improved version of previously reported SenVitAL and consists of ECFP/venus as FRET pair instead of the originally used pair CFP/YFP. To increase the physiological range of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> measurement, affinity mutants were created. Compared to the wild type, SenVitAL-5 with W44Q mutation has higher affinity and displayed large dynamic detection range (0.10-480 µM) in response to vitamin B<sub>12</sub> binding.

Developing improved human cell-based models which faithfully mimic biologically relevant connectivity patterns may improve drug screening efforts given the limited success of animal models to predict safety and efficacy of therapeutics in human clinical trials. To address this need, we have developed experimental models of defined neural circuitries through the compartmentalization of neuronal cell subtypes in a 96 well plate-based platform where each microwell is divided into two compartments connected by microchannels allowing high-throughput screening (HTS) of small molecules. We demonstrate that we can generate subtype-specific excitatory and inhibitory induced neuronal cells (iNs) from human stem cell lines and that these neurons form robust functional circuits with defined connectivity. Through the use of the genetically encoded calcium indicator GCaMP6f, we monitor calcium ion transients generated during neuronal firing between and within compartments. We further demonstrate functionality of the circuit by perturbing network activity through the addition of glutamate receptor blockers using automated liquid handling. Lastly, we show that we can stimulate network activity in defined neuronal subtypes through the expression of the designer receptor exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADD) hM3Dq and application of the ligand clozapine-N-oxide (CNO). Our results demonstrate the formation of functional neural circuits in a high-throughput platform that is compatible with compound screening, representing an important step towards developing new screening platforms for studying and ultimately treating psychiatric brain disorders that arise from disordered neural circuit function.",

The role of Ca<sup>2+</sup> -messaging during the activation of endothelial cells is well recognized and routinely measured by synthetic Ca<sup>2+</sup> -sensitive fluorophors. However, these compounds require fresh loading immediately before each experiment and in particular when grown in state-of-the-art 3D cell culture systems, endothelial cells are difficult to access with such sensors. Therefore, we developed transgenic pigs expressing a Ca<sup>2+</sup> -sensitive protein and examined its principal characteristics. Primary transgenic endothelial cells stimulated by ATP showed a definite and short influx of Ca<sup>2+</sup> into the cytosol, whereas exposure to human serum resulted in a more intense and sustained response. Surprisingly, not all endothelial cells reacted identically to a stimulus, rather activation took place in adjacent cells in a timely decelerated way and with distinct intensities. This effect was again more pronounced when cells were stimulated with human serum. Finally, we show clear evidence that antibody binding alone significantly activated endothelial cells, whereas antibody depletion dramatically reduced the stimulatory potential of serum. Transgenic porcine endothelial cells expressing a Ca<sup>2+</sup> -sensor represent an interesting tool to dissect factors inducing activation of porcine endothelial cells after exposure to human blood or serum.",

The sensor enabled high temporal resolution measurement of arrestin recruitment to the angiotensin AT<sub>1</sub> and vasopressin V<sub>2</sub> receptors. The analysis quantified the initial rate of arrestin recruitment (k<sub>τ</sub>), a biologically-meaningful kinetic drug efficacy parameter, by fitting time course data using routine curve-fitting methods.

The k<sub>τ</sub> ratio values were in good agreement with bias estimates from existing methods.

We establish this PAIR method to develop sensors for imaging reactive oxygen species (ROS) and calcium ions through oxaziridine-directed labeling of reactive methionine residues on β-actin and calmodulin (CaM), respectively, where the extent of methionine bioconjugation on these protein targets can serve as an indicator of oxidative stress or calcium status. In particular, application of PAIR to activity-based CaM detection provides a method for imaging integrated calcium activity in both in vitro cell and in vivo zebrafish models. By relying on native protein biochemistry, PAIR enables redox and metal imaging without introduction of external small molecules or genetically encoded indicators that can potentially buffer the natural/existing pools. This approach can be potentially generalized to target a broader range of analytes by pairing appropriate activity-based protein probes with protein detection reagents in a proximity-driven manner, providing a starting point not only for designing new sensors but also for monitoring endogenous activity of specific protein targets in biological specimens with spatial and temporal fidelity.",

In order to measure GSH at real-time, a ratiometric genetically encoded nanosensor was developed using fluorescent proteins and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) approach. The construction of the sensor involved the introduction of GSH binding protein (YliB) as a sensory domain between cyan fluorescent protein (CFP; FRET donor) and yellow fluorescent protein (YFP; FRET acceptor). The developed sensor, named as FLIP-G (Fluorescence Indicator Protein for Glutathione) was able to measure the GSH level under in vitro and in vivo conditions. When the purified FLIP-G was titrated with different concentrations of GSH, the FRET ratio increased with increase in GSH-concentration. The sensor was found to be specific for GSH and also stable to changes in pH. Moreover, in live bacterial cells, the constructed sensor enabled the real-time quantification of cytosolic GSH that is controlled by the oxidative stress level. When expressed in yeast cells, FRET ratio increased with the external supply of GSH to living cells. Therefore, as a valuable tool, the developed FLIP-G can monitor GSH level in living cells and also help in gaining new insights into GSH metabolism.",

        "abstract": "<i>In situ</i> amplification methods, such as hybridization chain reaction, are valuable tools for mapping the spatial distribution and subcellular location of target analytes. However, the live-cell applications of these methods are still limited due to challenges in the probe delivery, degradation, and cytotoxicity. Herein, we report a novel genetically encoded <i>in situ</i> amplification method to noninvasively image the subcellular location of RNA targets in living cells. In our system, a fluorogenic RNA reporter, Broccoli, was split into two nonfluorescent fragments and conjugated to the end of two RNA hairpin strands. The binding of one target RNA can then trigger a cascaded hybridization between these hairpin pairs and thus activate multiple Broccoli fluorescence signals. We have shown that such an <i>in situ</i> amplified strategy can be used for the sensitive detection and location imaging of various RNA targets in living bacterial and mammalian cells. This new design principle provides an effective and versatile platform for tracking various intracellular analytes.",

        "abstract": "Molecular tension sensors measure piconewton forces experienced by individual proteins in the context of the cellular microenvironment. Current genetically encoded tension sensors use FRET to report on extension of a deformable peptide encoded in a cellular protein of interest. Here, we present the development and characterization of a new type of molecular tension sensor based on bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET), which exhibits more desirable spectral properties and an enhanced dynamic range compared to other molecular tension sensors. Moreover, it avoids many disadvantages of FRET measurements in cells, including autofluorescence, photobleaching, and corrections of direct acceptor excitation. We benchmark the sensor by inserting it into the canonical mechanosensing focal adhesion protein vinculin, observing highly resolved gradients of tensional changes across focal adhesions. We anticipate that the BRET tension sensor will expand the toolkit available to study mechanotransduction at a molecular level and allow potential extension to an in vivo context.",

        "abstract": "Phosphoinositides constitute a critical family of lipids that regulate numerous cellular processes. Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP<sub>2</sub>) is arguably the most important plasma membrane phosphoinositide and is involved in regulating diverse processes. It is also the precursor of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP<sub>3</sub>), which is critical for growth factor signaling, as well as membrane polarization and dynamics. Studying these lipids remains challenging, because of their compartmentalized activities and location-dependent signaling profiles. Here, we introduce several new genetically encoded fluorescent biosensors, including FRET-based and dimerization-dependent fluorescent protein (ddFP)-based biosensors, that enable real-time monitoring of PIP<sub>2</sub> levels in live cells. In addition, we developed a red fluorescent biosensor for 3-phosphoinositides that can be co-imaged with the green PIP<sub>2</sub> indicator. Simultaneous visualization of the dynamics of PIP<sub>2</sub> and 3-phosphoinositides in the same cell shows that plasma membrane PIP<sub>3</sub> formation upon EGF stimulation is coupled to a decrease in the local pool of PIP<sub>2</sub>.",

        "abstract": "Cysteine plays a critical role in maintaining normal human metabolism, redox homeostasis, and immune regulation. Despite its functional versatility, cysteine metabolism in the human body is not well understood because of the lack of a robust tool for real-time measurement of cysteine at the cellular and sub-cellular level. In the present study, a genetically encoded nanosensor was developed using Cj0982 protein of Campylobacter jejuni, Enhanced Cyan Fluorescent Protein (ECFP) and Venus. The Cj0982 was sandwiched between ECFP and Venus for the construction of the nanosensor, named as Cys-FS (Cysteine-Fluorescent-Sensor). The Cys-FS is pH stable, specific to cysteine and has an affinity of 1.2 × 10<sup>-</sup><sup>5</sup> M. A range of affinity mutants were also developed with a cumulative cysteine detection range from 800 nM to 3.5 mM. The Cys-FS nanosensor was expressed in bacterial, yeast and mammalian cells, and the dynamics of cysteine level was measured in living cells using the confocal microscopy. The results showed that the Cys-FS nanosensor successfully monitored the dynamics of cysteine in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems without disrupting the cell. Thus, this study presents a novel nanosensor that can measure cysteine in living cells. This nanosensor is minimally invasive and non-toxic.",

        "abstract": "Voltage-sensitive fluorophores enable the direct visualization of membrane potential changes in living systems. To pair the speed and sensitivity of chemically synthesized fluorescent indicators with cell-type specific genetic methods, we here develop Rhodamine-based Voltage Reporters (RhoVR) that can be covalently tethered to genetically encoded, self-labeling enzymes. These chemical-genetic hybrids feature a photoinduced electron transfer triggered RhoVR voltage-sensitive indicator coupled to a chloroalkane HaloTag ligand through a long, water-soluble polyethylene glycol linker (RhoVR-Halo). When applied to cells, RhoVR-Halo dyes selectively and covalently bind to surface-expressed HaloTag enzyme on genetically modified cells. RhoVR-Halo dyes maintain high voltage sensitivities-up to 34% Δ<i>F</i>/<i>F</i> per 100 mV-and fast response times typical of untargeted RhoVRs, while gaining the selectivity of genetically encodable voltage indicators. We show that RhoVR-Halos can record action potentials in single trials from cultured rat hippocampal neurons and can be used in concert with green-fluorescent Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicators like GCaMP to provide simultaneous voltage and Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging. In a brain slice, RhoVR-Halos provide exquisite labeling of defined cells and can be imaged using epifluorescence, confocal, or two-photon microscopy. Using high-speed epifluorescence microscopy, RhoVR-Halos provide a read-out of action potentials from labeled cortical neurons in a rat brain slice, without the need for trial averaging. These results demonstrate the potential of hybrid chemical-genetic voltage indicators to combine the optical performance of small-molecule chromophores with the inherent selectivity of genetically encodable systems, permitting imaging modalities inaccessible to either technique individually.",

        "abstract": "The functional maturation status of human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) has a notable impact upon their use in pharmacological studies, disease modeling, and therapeutic applications. Non-cardiomyocytes (non-CMs) produced in the differentiation process have previously been identified as having an extrinsic influence upon hiPSC-CM development, yet the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. Herein, we aimed to modulate electrophysiological properties of hiPSC-CMs within co-cultures containing varied proportions of non-CMs and investigate the nature of interactions between these different cell types. Therefore, we sorted cardiac differentiations on day 10 and subsequently replated the cells at ratios of 7:3, 1:1, 3:7, and 1:9 non-CMs to CMs. After a month of co-culture, we evaluated electrophysiological properties through the genetically encoded voltage indicator ArcLight. We ultimately identified that co-cultures with approximately 70%-90% CM purity demonstrated the highest action potential (AP) amplitude and maximum upstroke velocity by day 40 of differentiation, indicative of enhanced electrophysiological maturation, as well as more ventricular-like AP morphologies. Notably, these findings were distinct from those observed for co-cultures of hiPSC-CMs and dermal fibroblasts. We determined that the co-culture phenotypes could not be attributed to paracrine effects of non-CMs due to the inability of conditioned media to recapitulate the observed effects. This led to the further observation of a distinctive expression pattern of connexin 43 (Cx43) at cell-cell interfaces between both CMs and non-CMs. Depletion of Cx43 by short hairpin RNA (shRNA) specifically in the non-CM population within a co-culture environment was able to recapitulate electrophysiological phenotypes of a purer hiPSC-CM population. Collectively, our data demonstrate that abundant non-CM content exerts a significant negative influence upon the electrophysiological maturation of hiPSC-CMs through Cx43-mediated cell-cell-contacts, and thus should be considered regarding the future production of purpose-built hiPSC-CM systems.",

        "abstract": "The zebrafish (Danio rerio) has emerged as a widely used model system during the last four decades. The fact that the zebrafish larva is transparent enables sophisticated in vivo imaging, including calcium imaging of intracellular transients in many different tissues. While being a vertebrate, the reduced complexity of its nervous system and small size make it possible to follow large-scale activity in the whole brain. Its genome is sequenced and many genetic and molecular tools have been developed that simplify the study of gene function in health and disease. Since the mid 90's, the development and neuronal function of the embryonic, larval, and later, adult zebrafish have been studied using calcium imaging methods. This updated chapter is reviewing the advances in methods and research findings of zebrafish calcium imaging during the last decade. The choice of calcium indicator depends on the desired number of cells to study and cell accessibility. Synthetic calcium indicators, conjugated to dextrans and acetoxymethyl (AM) esters, are still used to label specific neuronal cell types in the hindbrain and the olfactory system. However, genetically encoded calcium indicators, such as aequorin and the GCaMP family of indicators, expressed in various tissues by the use of cell-specific promoters, are now the choice for most applications, including brain-wide imaging. Calcium imaging in the zebrafish has contributed greatly to our understanding of basic biological principles during development and adulthood, and the function of disease-related genes in a vertebrate system.",

        "title": "Activation leads to a significant shift in the intracellular redox homeostasis of neutrophil-like cells.",
        "abstract": "Neutrophils produce a cocktail of oxidative species during the so-called oxidative burst to attack phagocytized bacteria. However, little is known about the neutrophils' redox homeostasis during the oxidative burst and there is currently no consensus about the interplay between oxidative species and cellular signaling, e.g. during the initiation of the production of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). Using the genetically encoded redox sensor roGFP2, expressed in the cytoplasm of the neutrophil-like cell line PLB-985, we saw that stimulation by both PMA and E. coli resulted in oxidation of the thiol residues in this probe. In contrast to the redox state of phagocytized bacteria, which completely breaks down, the neutrophils' cytoplasmic redox state switched from its intital -318 ± 6 mV to a new, albeit higher oxidized, steady state of -264 ± 5 mV in the presence of bacteria. This highly significant oxidation of the cytosol (p value = 7 × 10<sup>-5</sup>) is dependent on NOX2 activity, but independent of the most effective thiol oxidant produced in neutrophils, MPO-derived HOCl. While the shift in the intracellular redox potential is correlated with effective NETosis, it is, by itself not sufficient: Inhibition of MPO, while not affecting the cytosolic oxidation, significantly decreased NETosis. Furthermore, inhibition of PI3K, which abrogates cytosolic oxidation, did not fully prevent NETosis induced by phagocytosis of bacteria. Thus, we conclude that NET-formation is regulated in a multifactorial way, in part by changes of the cytosolic thiol redox homeostasis in neutrophils, depending on the circumstance under which the generation of NETs was initiated.",

        "abstract": "Genetically encoded fluorescent voltage indicators, such as ArcLight, have been used to report action potentials (APs) in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs). However, the ArcLight expression, in all cases, relied on a high number of lentiviral vector-mediated random genome integrations (8-12 copy/cell), raising concerns such as gene disruption and alteration of global and local gene expression, as well as loss or silencing of reporter genes after differentiation. Here, we report the use of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 nuclease technique to develop a hiPSC line stably expressing ArcLight from the AAVS1 safe harbor locus. The hiPSC line retained proliferative ability with a growth rate similar to its parental strain. Optical recording with conventional epifluorescence microscopy allowed the detection of APs as early as 21 days postdifferentiation, and could be repeatedly monitored for at least 5 months. Moreover, quantification and analysis of the APs of ArcLight-CMs identified two distinctive subtypes: a group with high frequency of spontaneous APs of small amplitudes that were pacemaker-like CMs and a group with low frequency of automaticity and large amplitudes that resembled the working CMs. Compared with FluoVolt voltage-sensitive dye, although dimmer, the ArcLight reporter exhibited better optical performance in terms of phototoxicity and photostability with comparable sensitivities and signal-to-noise ratios. The hiPSC line with targeted ArcLight engineering design represents a useful tool for studying cardiac development or hiPSC-derived cardiac disease models and drug testing.",

        "abstract": "Genetically encoded biosensors are widely used in cell biology for the non-invasive imaging of concentrations of ions or the activity of enzymes, to evaluate the distribution of small molecules, proteins and organelles, and to image protein interactions in living cells. These fluorescent molecules can be used either by transient expression in cultured cells or in entire organisms or through stable expression by producing transgenic animals characterized by genetically encoded and heritable biosensors. Using the mouse Thy1 mini-promoter, we generated a line of transgenic mice expressing a genetically encoded sensor for the simultaneous measurements of intracellular Cl<sup>-</sup> and pH. This construct, called ClopHensor, consists of a H<sup>+</sup>- and Cl<sup>-</sup>-sensitive variant of the enhanced green fluorescent protein (E<sup>2</sup>GFP) fused with a red fluorescent protein (DsRedm). Stimulation of hippocampal Schaffer collaterals proved that the sensor is functionally active. To reveal the expression pattern of ClopHensor across the brain of Thy1::ClopHensor mice, we obtained transparent brain samples using the CLARITY method and imaged them with confocal and light-sheet microscopy. We then developed a semi-quantitative approach to identify brain structures with high intrinsic sensor fluorescence. This approach allowed us to assess cell morphology and track axonal projection, as well as to confirm E<sup>2</sup>GFP and DsRedm fluorescence colocalization. This analysis also provides a map of the brain areas suitable for non-invasive monitoring of intracellular Cl<sup>-</sup>/pH in normal and pathological conditions.
