        "abstract": "Monitoring intracellular calcium is central to understanding cell signaling across nearly all cell types and organisms. Fluorescent genetically encoded calcium indicators (GECIs) remain the standard tools for in vivo calcium imaging, but require intense excitation light, leading to photobleaching, background autofluorescence and phototoxicity. Bioluminescent GECIs, which generate light enzymatically, eliminate these artifacts but have been constrained by low dynamic range and suboptimal calcium affinities. Here we show that CaBLAM ('calcium bioluminescence activity monitor'), an engineered bioluminescent calcium indicator, achieves an order-of-magnitude improvement in signal contrast and a tunable affinity matched to physiological cytosolic calcium. CaBLAM enables single-cell and subcellular activity imaging at video frame rates in cultured neurons and sustained imaging over hours in awake, behaving animals. These capabilities establish CaBLAM as a robust and general alternative to fluorescent GECIs, extending calcium imaging to regimes where excitation light is undesirable or infeasible.",

        "abstract": "Calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) signaling plays a pivotal role in determining B cell fate, shaping processes such as activation, differentiation, anergy or apoptosis. Upon B cell antigen receptor activation, Ca<sup>2+</sup> is rapidly mobilized from the endoplasmic reticulum and supplemented by Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx from the extracellular space, ultimately driving activation of various signaling pathways required for appropriate B cell responses. Although mitochondria also harbor significant levels of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, how mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics are regulated in B cells in response to activation or other cues remains unknown, as do the functional consequences of altered mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels. Chemical dyes as well as a genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor with a mitochondrial targeting sequence were used to study mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics in response to various stimuli. Proximity ligation assays were performed to assess interaction between mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum. Primary mouse B cells and the Burkitt lymphoma cell line Ramos were used to study functional consequences of the loss of the Mitochondrial Calcium Uniporter. Here, we show that mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels dynamically respond to cell activation, stress and metabolic cues and that mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake is largely dependent on the Mitochondrial Calcium Uniporter. Reduced mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake has a negative impact on mitochondrial activity and also affects cell signaling. These findings demonstrate that changes in mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> contribute to shaping functional B cell responses. The spatial and temporal dynamics of Ca<sup>2+</sup> accumulation within distinct subcellular compartments, particularly the cytosol, endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria, are essential for translating extracellular and intracellular signals into specific cellular outcomes. Our study provides new insights into the regulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis in B cells.",

However, these sensors are generally optimized for exponential growth rather than stationary phase where production occurs. Here, we find that our previously engineered E. coli green light sensor CcaSR, which functions robustly in exponential phase, fails in stationary phase due to spontaneous loss of an engineered chromophore biosynthetic pathway and accumulation of CcaS and CcaR. We optimize the genetic context and expression determinants of each component, resulting in a stable system named CcaSR<sub>stat</sub> that imposes little metabolic burden, exhibits low leakiness and an 80-fold green light response, and functions exclusively in stationary phase. We combine CcaSR<sub>stat</sub>-driven enzyme expression with varied static and periodic illumination patterns to achieve high titers of the industrially-relevant phenylpropanoid p-Coumaric acid and demonstrate that these optimizations scale to benchtop bioreactor conditions. Finally, we use CcaSR<sub>stat</sub> to optimize the expression level of a co-transcribed multi-enzyme metabolic pathway encoding production of plant-derived betaxanthin family pigments.

Cholinergic signaling in the striatum contributes to such flexible behavior, yet the timing and spatial organization of acetylcholine release during contingency changes remain unclear, limiting conceptual understanding of its role in behavioral flexibility. Using a genetically encoded acetylcholine sensor and 2-photon imaging in the dorsal striatum of behaving mice, we visualized acetylcholine dynamics during acquisition and reversal learning in a virtual reality Y-maze. Rewarded outcomes evoked phasic decreases in acetylcholine, whereas unexpected non-reward following reversal triggered widespread increases that predicted lose-shift behavior. Targeted inhibition of cholinergic interneurons reduced this adaptive response. Spatial analysis revealed heterogeneous, temporally distinct signals forming functionally diverse microdomains. These findings suggest that widespread and focal acetylcholine release during unexpected outcomes promotes adaptive response shifts, offering a mechanistic framework for understanding disorders such as addiction and obsessive-compulsive rituals.",

Here, we show that acid-sensing ion channel 3 (ASIC3) dramatically delays leukemogenesis. Asic3 deletion results in a remarkably enhanced self-renewal, reduced differentiation, and 9-fold greater number of murine acute myeloid LICs. We developed an ultrasensitive, ratiometric, genetically encoded fluorescent pH sensor (pHluorin3) and demonstrated that LICs prefer localizing in the endosteal niche with a neutral pH range of 7.34-7.42, but not in the vascular niche with a lower pH range of 6.89-7.22. Unexpectedly, acid-ASIC3 signaling inhibits both murine and human LIC activities in a noncanonical manner by interacting with the N-terminal of STIM1 to reduce calcium-mediated CAMK1-CREB-MEIS1-LDHA levels, without inducing cation currents. This study reveals a pathway in suppression of leukemogenesis in the acidic BM niche and provides insight into targeting LICs or other cancer stem cells through pH-dependent ASICs.",

        "abstract": "Myasthenia gravis is a rare autoimmune disease mediated by autoantibodies directed against acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) at the neuromuscular junction. These autoantibodies cause dysfunction through AChR blockade, AChR degradation due to crosslinking and internalisation, and complement activation. A novel in vitro model of the human neuromuscular junction was established on a microfluidic platform to investigate the effect of anti-AChR autoantibodies on complement activation and neuromuscular transmission and the mechanism of action of complement inhibition in myasthenia gravis. The NeuroMuscle<sup>TM</sup> platform enabled the connection of human induced pluripotent stem-cell-derived motor neuron spheroids with three-dimensional cultures of skeletal muscle fibres, forming functional neuromuscular junctions. Functional connectivity was assessed by glutamate stimulation of motor neuron spheroids and monitoring of calcium transients in genetically encoded calcium indicator protein 6 (GCaMP6)-transduced muscle fibres. Incubation of in vitro neuromuscular junction tissues with sera from patients with anti-AChR autoantibody-positive myasthenia gravis, in contrast to healthy controls, induced a significant increase in membrane attack complex (MAC) deposition and complement split products, accompanied by a notable reduction in calcium transients. Treatment with zilucoplan, a complement component 5 (C5) inhibitor, prevented complement activation and preserved neuromuscular junction functional integrity. The model demonstrated that complement-mediated damage is a major driver of neuromuscular junction functional impairment in the myasthenia gravis patient sera tested in this study. Furthermore, the study explored the reversibility of neuromuscular junction damage, revealing that shortening the delay before initiating complement inhibitor treatment in the in vitro neuromuscular junction tissues enhances the reversibility of neuromuscular transmission. These findings offer a mechanistic rationale for the observed clinical response in patients with anti-AChR autoantibody-positive myasthenia gravis treated with C5 inhibitors. The in vitro neuromuscular junction model provides a robust platform for studying the mechanistic pathways of complement-mediated damage and evaluating therapeutic interventions for myasthenia gravis.",

        "abstract": "Mitochondrial dysfunction and defective mitophagy are defining features of numerous neurodegenerative and metabolic disorders, yet existing tools provide limited ability to quantify mitophagy dynamics in real time within living, post-mitotic cells. Here we present MitoFlare, a mitochondria-targeted, reversible mtROS-responsive fluorogenic probe that enables continuous, non-genetic visualization of mitochondrial oxidative activation and turnover. MitoFlare incorporates dual TEMPO nitroxide quenchers into a long-wavelength rhodamine scaffold, producing >95% basal quenching and rapid, fully reversible fluorescence activation in response to mitochondrial superoxide, hydroxyl radicals, lipid-derived peroxyl species, and peroxynitrite. When combined with LysoTracker Green, MitoFlare forms a dual-probe imaging platform that resolves the entire mitophagy cascade with high spatial and temporal fidelity in intact PC12 neuronal cells. Using this platform, we established a quantitative framework comprising three mechanistically distinct metrics: (i) a proximity index that reports early mitochondrial engagement with lysosomes, (ii) Manders' M1 coefficient that captures mid-stage mitochondria-lysosome fusion and mitophagosome formation, and (iii) a quenching/swelling index that resolves terminal lysosomal degradation. Nutrient deprivation induced a complete, temporally ordered mitophagy program, including mtROS priming, Parkin-OPTN-associated fusion, and efficient acidification-dependent cargo degradation. In contrast, inhibition of v-ATPase with bafilomycin A1 arrested mitophagy at the fusion stage, resulting in persistent redox-active mitochondrial cargo that failed to undergo lysosomal digestion. Importantly, MitoFlare's reversible redox chemistry uniquely revealed accumulation of undegraded, oxidatively active mitochondrial remnants within non-acidified vesicles-pathological intermediates that are undetectable using irreversible ROS dyes or genetically encoded reporters. These findings demonstrate that mitophagy proceeds through discrete, redox-regulated and lysosome-dependent phases that can be quantitatively mapped in real time. By enabling synchronized measurement of oxidative activation, organelle trafficking, fusion, and degradation, the MitoFlare-LysoTracker system establishes a new benchmark for dynamic mitophagy analysis in physiologically relevant models. This platform provides a powerful foundation for mechanistic interrogation of mitochondrial quality control and for accelerating the discovery of therapeutic strategies aimed at restoring mitophagic fidelity in neurodegenerative, cardiovascular, and metabolic diseases.",

        "abstract": "Voltage-sensing phosphatases (VSPs) provide a conserved framework for dissecting the mechanics of voltage sensing and for engineering genetically encoded voltage indicators (GEVIs). To evaluate how natural sequence diversity shapes function, we compared VSP voltage-sensing domains (VSDs) from multiple species by replacing the phosphatase domain with a fluorescent protein to enable optical detection of VSD responses. Every construct that reached the plasma membrane produced a voltage-dependent optical signal, underscoring the deep conservation of voltage sensing across VSP orthologs. Yet lineage-specific substitutions generated strikingly different phenotypes. A plankton VSP ortholog from <i>Eurytemora carolleeae</i> and the Sea Hare (<i>Aplysia californica</i>) VSP exhibited left-shifted activation ranges, producing robust fluorescence transitions during modest depolarizations of the plasma membrane. The human VSD of hVSP2 yielded weak, sluggish responses with poor recovery, but reintroduction of a conserved arginine in S1 (G95R) partially restored reversibility, implicating lipid-facing residues in conformational stability. The Chinese hamster (<i>Cricetulus griseus</i>) VSD, with atypical S4 sensing charges (RWIR), generated a slow fluorescence increase during depolarization, while reverting to the consensus arginine (RRIR) inverted the polarity to a decrease. These contrasting behaviors show that single residue changes can reshape how VSD movements influence the fluorescent reporter, highlighting the molecular precision revealed by GEVI measurements. Together, these results show that voltage-dependent signaling is deeply conserved across VSPs but shaped by lineage-specific sequence variation, establishing VSPs as powerful models for probing voltage sensing and guiding GEVI design.",

Methods based on radioactive [3H]-GABA uptake come with significant regulatory concerns, cost, and workflow complexity, which could be resolved by an alternate assay. To address this issue, we developed a high-content fluorescence imaging assay of GAT-1-mediated GABA uptake using a genetically encoded GABA sensor, iGABA-Snfr. We demonstrated that pathogenic variants strongly reduced uptake (mean, -89.4% [95% CI, -71.5% to -107.3%]).

The ER is surrounded by a membrane that separates its lumen from the cytoplasm. The ER membrane harbors channels and pumps capable of controlling ion flux and creating a voltage gradient. Because the ER membrane potential is difficult to study experimentally little is known about how voltage influences its many vital functions. Here we introduce optical probes of ER membrane potential derived from the hybrid voltage sensor (hVoS) family of genetically-encoded voltage sensors. Probes were targeted to the ER using motifs from three ER proteins, Sec61β, cytochrome P450, and cytochrome b<sub>5</sub> type A. As shown recently with other types of ER voltage sensors, patch-clamp fluorometry recording with our new probes demonstrated that voltage steps applied to the plasma membrane elicit a voltage change at the ER membrane. These probes exhibited subtle differences in their responses suggesting they target different ER compartments. The steeper voltage dependence of Sec61β-hVoS (mCerulean3-Sec61β) signals suggested that this probe targets an ER compartment rich in voltage-gated ion channels. The ER voltage change is slow, but its onset is virtually synchronous with the plasma membrane voltage step. This suggests a direct electrical coupling into the ER lumen through plasma membrane-ER contacts. Analysis with the aid of an equivalent circuit provided an estimate of the resistance of these contacts. The rapid, direct transmission of voltage changes from the plasma membrane to the ER provides a mechanism for regulating ER function that could be especially important in excitable cells. The sensors introduced here provide researchers with powerful tools for imaging ER voltage and assessing its impact on cellular function.",

A new genetically encoded fluorescent biosensor based on Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) is composed of a JH-binding protein (JHBP) derived from <i>Bombyx mori</i>, which is fused with two fluorescent protein pairs (mTFP1 and mVenus) and exhibits a ratiometric readout. The mTFP1-JHBP-mVenus proteins, flanked by the two fluorescent proteins at the N- and C-termini, respectively, exhibited no discernible FRET as a primary FRET JH sensor. This suggests that inducible FRET by JH binding may have been compromised. Optimizing the insertion of mTFP1 into JHBP enabled inducible FRET in the presence of JH. The resulting construct, the FRET JH Indicator Agent (FREJIA), is the first ratiometric, genetically encoded, and fluorescent biosensor for JH detection. FREJIA interacts with the binding protein and emits a resonance energy transfer signal in response to binding to JH I, II, and III and methoprene at nanomolar ranges. FREJIA enables ratiometric imaging of JH III in live mammalian cells. Our results showed that FRET can be applied to the selective and ratiometric monitoring of JH levels.",

Because SA levels and signaling are highly dynamic in space and time, a suite of SA-focused tools, including SA-specific microbial biosensors and SA-responsive transcriptional and chemical reporters, has been developed to study them. This review compares three classes of tools in terms of sensitivity, specificity, temporal resolution, invasiveness, quantifiability, and suitability across species. We describe developing genetically encoded sensors that can directly sense salicylic acid and report it, for example, via a fluorescence resonance energy transfer signal or another real-time output. We offer recommendations on method selection by research goal and plant species, as well as combined protocols (long-term autoluminescence plus local probes/biosensors) for cross-validation. Future work should prioritize substrate-free, quantitative SA reporters deployable in crops and the field; coupled with CRISPR-based editing and screening, these tools would enable reporter-guided discovery of immunity genes and rapid engineering of durable disease resistance.",

In this study, <i>Arabidopsis</i> and rice lines expressing a FLIPPi biosensor were used to monitor cytosolic Pi dynamics in root epidermal cells. Sensor functionality was confirmed by measuring FRET responses to graded Pi supplies, revealing a consistent reduction in FRET ratios with increasing Pi concentrations, reflecting elevated cytosolic Pi levels. Comparisons with a Pi-insensitive FLIPPi variant confirmed the specificity of the observed changes. Furthermore, live imaging demonstrated rapid and dynamic alterations in cytosolic Pi upon treatment with defense-related hormones and elicitors of immune responses supporting a link between Pi signaling and plant immunity. Finally, the application of phosphite, an analog of Pi, altered Pi dynamics in both <i>Arabidopsis</i> and rice, suggesting an interference with Pi accumulation.

A variety of nanozymes have been revealed with the ability to catalyze substrates of oxidoreductases, mostly including peroxidase (POD), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT), and some of them display multienzyme-like properties, which make them highly attractive for biomedical applications. However, the specific manifestations of nanozyemes within cells remain challenging to predict and detect. In this study, we developed a real-time, dynamic, and highly sensitive live-cell biosensor by expressing HyPer7 probe in the cytosol and mitochondria to monitor the cytosolic and mitochondrial H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> dynamics in a leukemia cell line THP-1. The successful expression of the probes in the cytosol and mitochondria was confirmed using confocal fluorescence microscopy. When the THP-1 cells were exposed to exogenous H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, the fluorescence intensity at 525 nm upon excitation with 405 nm lasers (referred to as F405) decreased, while that upon excitation with 488 nm lasers (referred to as F488) increased.

In this study, we developed four fluorescence-based biosensors for inhibitors of protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B), a therapeutic target for cancer and diabetes, and compared their performance in the presence of heterologous terpenoid pathways, a promising source of new inhibitors. When expressed in <i>Escherichia coli</i>, all four could reliably detect an exogenously supplied PTP1B inhibitor, but only one remained functional alongside terpenoid pathways, where pathway-derived stress reduced overall fluorescence. This sensor, which links PTP1B inhibition to the assembly of a split T7 RNA polymerase, exhibited a high dynamic range with minimal toxicity, a common liability of T7-based circuits. Variants of this sensor with different sensitivities to inhibition and stress allowed us to separate the terpenoid pathways that made PTP1B inhibitors from those that did not. Our findings show how pathway-specific stresses (e.g., terpene synthase expression) can alter biosensor signals as strongly as their target analytes and provide a framework for disentangling these confounding effects in high-throughput screens.",

Mutation of H148 to cysteine promotes the neutral phenolic chromophore in the monomer that excites predominantly at ∼400 nm. Homodimerisation <i>via</i> a copper-dependent disulphide bridge switches the chromophore to the charged phenolate that excites at ∼490 nm. The result is a ∼30 fold increase in the fluorescence emission ratio. Homodimerisation kinetics are further improved by optimising the sfGFP homodimer interface, generating the variant termed GFP-diS2. Structures of the monomeric and dimeric GFP-diS2 suggest that charge switching is through peptide bond flipping and the formation of a buried organised water network around the chromophore that spans the interface region. Fusion to a leucine zipper protein dimerisation element greatly increased the GFP-diS2 association rate making it a more effective copper sensor <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> with Cu(i) instigating the signal change quicker and at lower ion concentrations than Cu(ii). Thus, GFP-diS2 provides the framework for generating a sensitive genetically encoded copper sensor and will eventually be adapted to monitor one of the most important protein-protein interactions in biology, homo-oligomerisation.",

Many reporter cell lines were created for generating phenotypic data in assigning the biological impact of large compound libraries. A major requirement of a phenotypic screen is the reporter cell lines for appropriate biomarkers with a good predictive value. Here, we have developed a stable cell expressing TagBFP2-53BP1 as a real-time sensor for DNA damage at the single-cell level that marks 53BP1 foci formation under physiological conditions, as well as toxicant-induced DNA damage. The cells were further engineered to report mitochondrial permeabilization using Smac-RFP, providing a broader application potential for this cellular model. Once the cells are further expressed with the autophagy marker EGFP-LC3, it is possible to image distinct cell fates such as autophagy, mitochondrial permeabilization, and DNA damage at the single-cell level. Using this system, we demonstrate that early cell death induced by telomerase inhibitors involves double-strand breaks and mitochondrial permeabilization. The model also enabled systematic profiling of several toxicants based on clearly noticeable cell fates. The approach of using live single-cell sensors for multiple distinct and diverse phenotypes offers great advantages over independent single-parameter-based assays, with the additional benefit of extracting heterogeneous cell responses over time, revealing more insight into the toxicity and mechanism of action for predictive applications.",

The ER is surrounded by a membrane that separates its lumen from the cytoplasm. The ER membrane harbors channels and pumps capable of controlling ion flux and creating a voltage gradient. Because the ER membrane potential is difficult to study experimentally, little is known about how voltage influences its many vital functions. Here, we introduce optical probes of ER membrane potential derived from the hybrid voltage sensor (hVoS) family of genetically encoded voltage sensors. Probes were targeted to the ER using motifs from three ER proteins, Sec61β, cytochrome P450, and cytochrome b<sub>5</sub> type A. As shown recently with other types of ER voltage sensors, patch-clamp fluorometry recording with our new probes demonstrated that voltage steps applied to the plasma membrane elicit a voltage change at the ER membrane. These probes exhibited subtle differences in their responses suggesting they target different ER compartments. The steeper voltage dependence of Sec61β-hVoS (mCerulean3-Sec61β) signals suggested that this probe targets an ER compartment rich in voltage-gated ion channels. The ER voltage change is slow, but its onset is virtually synchronous with the plasma membrane voltage step. This suggests a direct electrical coupling into the ER lumen through plasma membrane-ER contacts. Analysis with the aid of an equivalent circuit provided an estimate of the resistance of these contacts. The rapid, direct transmission of voltage changes from the plasma membrane to the ER provides a mechanism for regulating ER function that could be especially important in excitable cells. The sensors introduced here provide researchers with powerful tools for imaging ER voltage and assessing its impact on cellular function.",

        "abstract": "Many genetically encoded voltage indicators (GEVIs) rely on fluorescent protein (FP) domains to report changes in membrane potential. Rapid and reversible disruption of steady-state fluorescence during voltage sensor activation revealed transient conformational changes near the chromophore in the FP domain, implicating chromophore flexibility as a potential mechanism of signal modulation. Substitution of a bulky phenylalanine near the chromophore with threonine (F165T) introduced a distinct secondary component in the fluorescence response, consistent with increased chromophore mobility. This effect was tunable: an external, directionally polarized offset (164<i>T</i>/166F) reoriented the internal threonine side chain, restoring steric hindrance and eliminating the secondary signal. Thus, threonine can function as a context-sensitive molecular switch shaped by β-can surface chemistry. A second internal threonine (T203) also acted as a molecular switch under modified external conditions, generating a secondary signal that is susceptible to membrane curvature during depolarization suggesting that plasma membrane geometry can modulate GEVI activity under permissive conformational states. Crystal structures of Super Ecliptic pHluorin (SE), SE A227D, and a new FP variant revealed that external residues can influence internal side chain orientation. In the new variant, pH-dependent rearrangement of the seventh β-strand dramatically repositions D147 from the interior interacting with the chromophore to the external surface, while H148 shifts from the exterior to interact with the chromophore in alkaline conditions. These insights led to the development of a new GEVI, Ulla, which inverts the polarity of the optical signal─becoming brighter upon depolarization─displays reduced pH sensitivity in the physiological range, and performs reliably under low-light, high-speed imaging conditions in vitro and in vivo using widefield and 2-photon microscopy. Together, these findings present a new approach to modulating chromophore behavior offering broad potential for FP-based biosensor development.",

While iron regulatory proteins (IRPs) function as RNA-binding proteins during iron-limiting conditions and reflect cellular iron status, we lack genetically-encodeable tools to quantify bioavailable intracellular iron status over developmental time and at single-cell resolution. In order to better understand the cellular environment that supports or restricts IRP-active conditions, particularly during complex and dynamic changes leading to differentiated states, we present a ratiometric genetically-encoded biosensor called FEOX. FEOX is a ratiometric fluorescent biosensor of the cellular iron environment based on a mammalian hemerythrin-like domain, acting as an iron-dependent ligand-based regulatory switch. Compared to increased IRP activity in response to iron-limitation, FEOX dynamics demonstrate decreased ratiometric fluorescence representing decreased cellular iron during iron-limitation. Using FEOX we are able to quantify the dynamics of the bioavailable cellular iron environment during early stem cell differentiation by ratiometric measurements at single-cell resolution. Results from FEOX and from an IRP activity sensor during stem cell pluripotency transition and early differentiation provide orthogonal support for an increased iron demand state. Using these genetically-encodeable tools will allow greater insight into cellular iron homeostasis within mammalian systems. IRPs function as RNA-binding proteins during iron-limiting conditions, regulating the stability and translation of messenger RNAs that are essential for cellular iron homeostasis. However, to better understand and study the cell and molecular regulators of the iron-limiting conditions required for IRP RNA-binding activity, new tools are needed to monitor iron-responsive alterations in the intracellular environment at single-cell resolution and over developmental time. We devised a genetically-encoded biosensor called FEOX that depends on molecular iron interactions independent of IRP function and directly gauges bioavailable cellular iron.",

We originally reported a genetically encoded, fluorescent protein-based Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) biosensor that can detect micromolar levels of extracellular ATP. Through mutagenesis of the ATP binding site and optimization of cell-surface display, here we report the development of a second-generation biosensor called ECATS2 with greater than three-fold higher affinity for extracellular ATP. We found that the tether length between the FRET biosensor and the cell surface anchor is critical to optimization of its performance.

        "abstract": "Dopamine (DA) is a critical neurotransmitter that regulates many physiological and behavioral processes. The central dopaminergic system plays a pivotal role in modulating general anesthesia (GA). DA release in the brain is mainly concentrated in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), prefrontal cortex, hypothalamus, and dorsal striatum. Several NAc neuron subtypes are essential for modulating states of consciousness during GA. However, whether NAc DA signal dynamics correlate with different states of consciousness under sevoflurane anesthesia remains to be elucidated. In this study, we measured the dynamic fluctuations of NAc DA levels throughout sevoflurane anesthesia to verify its role. An intensity-based genetically encoded DA indicator, dLight1.1, was employed to track DA release in the NAc. Fiber photometry combined with electroencephalogram/electromyogram recordings was employed to synchronously track NAc DA signal dynamics across different states of consciousness under sevoflurane anesthesia. Under 2.5% sevoflurane exposure, DA release in the NAc significantly increased during the initial 100 s of sevoflurane induction, which was designated as sevo on-1 (mean ± standard error of the mean [SEM]; baseline vs. sevo on-1, <i>p</i> = 0.0261), and continued to decrease in the subsequent anesthesia maintenance phases (sevo on-1 vs. sevo on-4, <i>p</i> = 0.0070). Following the cessation of sevoflurane administration (with intervals denoted as sevooff), NAc DA gradually returned to baseline levels (sevo on-1 vs. sevo off-1, <i>p</i> = 0.0096; sevo on-1 vs. sevo off-3, <i>p</i> = 0.0490; sevo on-1 vs. sevo off-4, <i>p</i> = 0.0059; sevo on-4 vs. sevo off-4, <i>p</i> = 0.0340; sevo off-1 vs. sevo off-4, <i>p</i> = 0.0451). During the induction phase, NAc DA signal dynamics markedly increased during the pre-loss of consciousness (LOC) period (pre-anesthesia baseline vs. pre-LOC, <i>p</i> = 0.0329) and significantly declined after LOC (pre-LOC vs. post-LOC, <i>p</i> = 0.0094). For the emergence period, NAc DA release exhibited a noticeable increase during the initial period after recovery of consciousness (ROC) (anesthesia baseline vs. post-ROC, <i>p</i> = 0.0103; pre-ROC vs. post-ROC, <i>p</i> = 0.0086). Furthermore, the DA signals peaked rapidly upon the initiation of the burst wave and then gradually attenuated, indicating a positive correlation with the burst wave onset during burst suppression events. Our findings revealed that NAc DA neurotransmitter signal dynamics correlate with different states of consciousness throughout sevoflurane anesthesia.",

To elucidate the dynamic role of α-MSH release in regulating appetite, specific, sensitive, and spatiotemporally resolved genetic sensors are required. The melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) scaffold was leveraged for its robust plasma membrane expression, high affinity for melanocortins and low affinity for AgRP to design a α-MSH selective sensor for in vivo use. This was achieved by integrating circularly permuted green fluorescent protein (cpGFP) into the receptor, which we named Fluorescence Amplified Receptor sensor for Melanocortin (FLARE<sub>MC</sub>). The FLARE<sub>MC</sub> sensor has high potency and selectivity in heterologous and homologous expressing cells for α-MSH and the synthetic melanocortin agonist MTII but not to the inverse agonist AgRP. The sensor exhibited impaired signaling, with reduced G protein activation, no β-arrestin coupling, and failed to internalize upon agonist stimulation. In vitro, FLARE<sub>MC</sub> displayed high photostability and reversible photoactivation. These properties suggest that the FLARE<sub>MC</sub> is suitable for long-term activity recording in the brain without desensitizing or interfering with endogenous melanocortin receptor signaling. When expressed in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the mouse hypothalamus, the primary site of anorexigenic α-MSH signaling, FLARE<sub>MC</sub> demonstrated its effectiveness in detecting changes associated with melanocortin responses in vivo. FLARE<sub>MC</sub> enables the study of melanocortin system in cultured cells and in vivo. This first of its class highly sensitive melanocortin sensor will serve as a valuable tool to advance our understanding of the complex dynamics governing melanocortin-dependent appetite regulation and related processes in the brain.",

However, due to limitations such as poor probe permeability and cytotoxicity associated with conventional antibody-based or genetically encoded labeling techniques, live-cell imaging remains a significant challenging. To address these limitations, here in this study, we developed and rigorously validated a novel aptamer-based fluorescent probe for real-time imaging of NEK9 kinase in living cells. First, through <i>in vitro</i> capture-SELEX, a DNA aptamer termed as Apt-011 which could selectively bind NEK9 was identified. Further, capitalizing on the small size, low immunogenicity, and synthetic flexibility of aptamers, we engineered a \"signal-on\" NEK9-specific aptamer-based fluorescent probe platform. This design leverages the aptamer's target--induced conformational change to physically separate the fluorophore-quencher pair, and it has been validated that this fluorescent probe platform could successfully visualize intracellular NEK9 in live-cells without obvious cytotoxicity (cell viability > 95% at working concentrations), offering new opportunities to study NEK9-associated signaling pathways. This work not only provides a robust tool for kinase research but also establishes a generalizable strategy to overcome key bottlenecks in live-cell imaging through rational aptamer engineering.",

        "abstract": "Agonist-induced interaction of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) with β-arrestins (βarrs) is a critical mechanism that regulates the spatiotemporal pattern of receptor localization and signaling. While the underlying mechanism governing GPCR-βarr interaction is primarily conserved and involves receptor activation and phosphorylation, there are several examples of receptor-specific fine-tuning of βarr-mediated functional outcomes. Considering the key contribution of conformational plasticity of βarrs in driving receptor-specific functional responses, it is important to develop novel sensors capable of reporting distinct βarr conformations in cellular context. Here, we design an intrabody version of a βarr-recognizing nanobody (nanobody32), referred to as intrabody32 (Ib32), in NanoLuc enzyme complementation assay format and measure its ability to recognize βarr1 and 2 in live cells upon activation of a broad set of GPCRs. Ib32 robustly recognizes activated βarr1 and 2 in the plasma membrane and endosomes, and effectively mirrors βarr recruitment profile upon stimulation of selected GPCRs. We also design an Ib32 sensor for polarization microscopy with a change in linear dichroism as readout and demonstrate its utility for monitoring βarr activation upon stimulation of selected GPCRs by natural and biased agonists. Taken together with a previously described sensor of βarr1 activation, Ib32 underscores the inherent flexibility encoded in βarrs and conformational diversity imparted by different GPCRs, which is further corroborated using an orthogonal limited proteolysis assay. Our study presents Ib32 as a sensor of βarr activation and highlights the structural diversity of βarrs, which likely allows their ability to interact with, and regulate, a large repertoire of GPCRs.",

However, it has remained difficult to measure intracellular H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> with high specificity and in a quantitative manner. Here, we present a detailed protocol for a chemogenetic method that enables the detection and quantitation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in living cells by converting intracellular H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> into fluorescent or luminescent signals. This is achieved by expressing the engineered heme peroxidase APEX2 in cells and subcellular locations of interest and by providing an appropriate fluorogenic or luminogenic substrate from outside. This method differs fundamentally from previously developed genetically encoded H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> probes; those are reversible and measure the balance between probe thiol oxidation and reduction. By contrast, APEX2 turns over its substrate irreversibly and therefore directly measures endogenous H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> availability. Our detailed step-by-step protocol covers the generation of APEX2-expressing cell lines, the implementation of fluorescent and luminescent measurements and examples for application. Ectopic expression of APEX2 can be achieved in 3 days, while the actual measurements typically require 1-2 h. This protocol is intended for entry-level scientists.",

        "abstract": "Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD), caused by perinatal alcohol exposure (PeAE) and prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE), is characterized by significant cognitive impairments, including reduced cognitive flexibility. Despite the critical role of cholinergic interneurons (CINs) in the dorsomedial striatum (DMS) for cognitive and behavioral flexibility, their contribution to neurobehavioral deficits in FASD remains unclear. To address this gap, this research explored the impact of PeAE and PAE on CIN populations and activity, cognitive flexibility, and compulsive drinking behaviors in adult offspring. We first assessed CIN number by staining striatal sections for choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) and observed a significant reduction in CINs within the posterior striatum of adult PeAE offspring. Functional assessments revealed that PeAE and PAE markedly decreased CIN firing activity and reduced acetylcholine (ACh) release in the DMS, as measured by electrophysiology recordings and live-tissue confocal imaging using a genetically encoded ACh sensor. Behaviorally, PeAE offspring exhibited a significant deficit in adapting to reversed action-outcome contingencies despite intact initial learning capabilities. Moreover, PeAE mice exhibited compulsive alcohol drinking behavior, characterized by elevated consumption and preference for quinine-adulterated alcohol. These findings collectively highlight the critical role of impaired cholinergic signaling in the cognitive and behavioral deficits observed following PeAE and PAE. Understanding this cholinergic dysfunction provides valuable insights necessary for developing targeted interventions aimed at mitigating cognitive and behavioral consequences associated with FASD.",

Specifically, the ventral tegmental area (VTA), the dopaminergic hub of the reward pathways located deep within the midbrain, is crucial for regulating the release of dopamine (DA) throughout the central nervous system (CNS). To better understand the nuances among chronic pain, VTA response, and therapeutics, implementing progressive approaches for mapping and visualizing the deep brain in real time during nociceptive stimulation is crucial. In this study, we utilize a fluorescence imaging platform with a genetically encoded calcium indicator (GCaMP6s) to directly visualize activity in the VTA during acute nociceptive stimulation in both healthy adult mice and adult mice with partial nerve ligation (PNL)-induced neuropathic pain. We also investigate the visualization of the analgesic properties of morphine. Deep brain imaging using our self-fabricated µ-complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) imaging device allows the tracking of the VTA's response to adverse stimuli. Our findings show that nociceptive stimulation is associated with a reduction in VTA fluorescence activity, supporting the potential of this platform for visualizing pain-related responses in the central nervous system. Additionally, treatment with morphine significantly reduces the neuronal response caused by mechanical stimuli and is observable using the CMOS imaging platform, demonstrating a novel way to potentially assess and treat neuropathic pain.",

We employed genetic knockout of TRPM4 (Trpm4 <sup>-/-</sup> ) and glibenclamide treatment to explore the role of sulfonylurea receptor 1 transient receptor potential melastatin-4 (SUR1-TRPM4) channel in these Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses. Both approaches significantly suppressed the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in the astrocytic endfeet and reduced perivascular expression of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-related signaling pathway sensor calmodulin (CaM). Furthermore, we found that AQP4 localization was no longer confined to the domains of astrocytic endfeet following SE. Inhibition of SUR1-TRPM4 through pharmacological blockade or gene deletion restored the subcellular localization of AQP4, reduced cerebral edema, and improved cognitive outcomes post-SE. Our findings suggest that SUR1-TRPM4 plays a pivotal role in regulating astrocytic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals and mediating the aberrant expression and subcellular localization of astrocytic AQP4 along perivascular pathways. Together, these findings demonstrate a novel molecular mechanism underscoring SUR1-TRPM4 therapy in the treatment of SE characterized by dysregulated Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in astrocytic endfeet.",

        "abstract": "While genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicators are valuable for visualizing neural activity, their speed and sensitivity have had limited performance when compared to chemical dyes and electrophysiology, particularly at synaptic compartments. We addressed these limitations by engineering a suite of next-generation GCaMP8-based indicators, targeted to presynaptic boutons, active zones, and postsynaptic compartments at the Drosophila neuromuscular junction. We first validated these sensors to be superior to previous versions. Next, we developed a new Python-based analysis program, <i>CaFire,</i> which enables the automated quantification of evoked and spontaneous Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals. Using <i>CaFire,</i> we show a ratiometric presynaptic GCaMP8m sensor accurately captures physiologically-relevant presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> changes with superior sensitivity and similar kinetics compared to chemical dyes. Moreover, we test the ability of an active zone-targeted, ratiometric GCaMP8f sensor to report differences in Ca2+ between release sites. Finally, a newly engineered postsynaptic GCaMP8m, positioned near glutamate receptors, detects quantal events with temporal and signal resolution comparable to electrophysiological recordings. These next generation indicators and analytical methods demonstrate that GCaMP8 sensors, targeted to synaptic compartments, can now achieve the speed and sensitivity necessary to resolve Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics at levels previously only attainable with chemical dyes or electrophysiology.",

        "abstract": "The neurotransmitter histamine is involved in control of food intake, yet its dynamics during individual feeding episodes remain unexplored. Therefore, we used the novel genetically-encoded histamine sensor, HisLightG, combined with fiber photometry to measure histamine release in two hypothalamic regions critical for the food-suppressive effects of histamine, the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVH), and the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH). Male mice were tested under different conditions to assess whether hunger, time of day, or the caloric content of the solution they were given affected histamine fluctuations. We found that histamine levels changed rapidly in response to eating. These histamine fluctuations were influenced by experimental conditions, with slightly smaller responses when the test solution was sucralose (both regions) or during the light cycle (PVH only). Notable regional differences were identified, such that in the PVH histamine rebounded to above baseline levels, whereas in the VMH histamine remained lower than baseline for at least 10 s after licking ceased. In a separate cohort of male and female mice, enhancing histamine tone via administration of a histamine precursor (L-histidine) reduced the number of licks across multiple sucrose concentrations. Together, these findings indicate that histaminergic activity is modulated rapidly during ingestive episodes, and that understanding these release patterns will give insight into histamine's role in appetite suppression.",

        "abstract": "We developed the novel biosensor platform Luciferase Activity Modulated by Phosphorylation (LAMP) to monitor, with unprecedented sensitivity and dynamic range, reversible protein phosphorylation in cells. Based on NanoLuc luciferase complementation (NanoBiT), LAMP sensors are small (22 kD) and provide stable and bright light output that decreases upon phosphorylation and increases upon dephosphorylation. In this report, we designed LAMP biosensors to report spatial and temporal dynamics of cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) signaling. By incorporating both PKA phosphorylation and protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) dephosphorylation motifs into the small component of split NanoLuc (generating PKABiT/pBiT), we achieved a sevenfold dynamic range. LAMP sensors are modular and flexible, allowing the two components, LgBiT and pBiT, to be expressed as part of the same polypeptide (cis) or as part of separate, but interacting polypeptides (trans). With trans LAMP, we show that RIα and RIβ form heterodimers with activities indistinguishable from homodimers of the two PKA regulatory subunit isoforms. Cis PKA LAMP sensors revealed different activation and inactivation kinetics of endogenous, membrane anchored PKA/RI and PKA/RII holoenzymes. They also allowed us to measure kinetics of cAMP diffusion and PKA catalytic subunit translocation to the nucleus. Finally, we used a regeneratively phosphorylated PKA LAMP sensor to identify an autoinhibitory sequence in the PP2A regulatory subunit B56δ. By tailoring the sequence of pBiT, the LAMP platform can be extended to track the activity of other protein kinases and phosphatases and second messengers they respond to, thus providing new tools for cell signaling research and drug discovery.",

Continuous-wave ESR measurements at room temperature show a rigid Aer flavin immobilized in the cofactor pocket and Q-band electron nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) measurements identify a predominant anionic semiquinone radical state in cell. Q-band four-pulse double electron-electron resonance (4P-DEER) measurements indicate a 4.1 nm distance between the two flavins of an Aer homodimer, consistent with previous in vitro measurements, but also reveal additional separations in cell indicative of chemoreceptor arrays, not previously observed for Aer.

        "abstract": "Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD), caused by prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE), is characterized by significant cognitive impairments, including reduced cognitive flexibility. Despite the critical role of cholinergic interneurons (CINs) in the dorsomedial striatum (DMS) for cognitive and behavioral flexibility, their contribution to neurobehavioral deficits in FASD remains unclear. To address this gap, this research explored the impact of PAE on CIN populations and activity, cognitive flexibility, and compulsive drinking behaviors in adult offspring. Using ChAT-Cre;Ai14-tdTomato mice combined with ChAT staining, we found substantial reductions in CIN number within the striatum of adult PAE offspring. Functional assessments revealed that PAE markedly decreased CIN firing activity and reduced acetylcholine (ACh) release in the DMS, as measured by electrophysiology recordings and live-tissue confocal imaging using a genetically encoded ACh sensor. Behaviorally, PAE-exposed offspring exhibited a significant deficit in adapting to reversed action-outcome contingencies despite intact initial learning capabilities. Moreover, PAE-exposed mice exhibited compulsive alcohol drinking behavior, characterized by elevated consumption and preference for quinine-adulterated alcohol. These findings collectively highlight the critical role of impaired cholinergic signaling in the cognitive and behavioral deficits observed following PAE. Understanding this cholinergic dysfunction provides valuable insights necessary for developing targeted interventions aimed at mitigating cognitive and behavioral consequences associated with FASD.",

To date, no versatile technology has been developed to directly label and visualize an active replicase in live plant cells because, in general, replicase function is not retained when it is fused to a protein for fluorescence imaging. We developed a technique to label and image a plant virus replicase during infection using the transiently expressed human influenza hemagglutinin (HA) frankenbody (FB), an antibody fragment that binds the HA epitope. The function of FB was demonstrated by visualizing the targeting of mCherry-fused FB (FB-mCherry) to an HA-tagged and GFP-fused endoplasmic reticulum (ER) marker protein in its native location. The combination of a two-component inducible system with the FB probe enabled FB-mCherry to label an HA epitope-tagged, functional replicase of Plantago asiatica mosaic virus (PlAMV) during its infection in Nicotiana benthamiana cells without affecting virus replication efficiency. The HA-tagged PlAMV replicase forms punctate structures associated with the ER and plasmodesmata and is localized in the vicinity of dsRNA, a hallmark of a viral replication complex. This application of epitope tag-binding intracellular probes for live subcellular imaging in plant cells offers insights into the localization dynamics of an active plant virus replicase during infection and the potential to co-localize host factors with the active replicase in situ.",

        "abstract": "Protein poly-ADP-ribosylation (PARylation) is a post-translational modification formed by transferring successive units of ADP-ribose to target proteins to form poly-ADP-ribose (PAR) chains. PAR plays a critical role in the DNA damage response (DDR) by acting as a signaling platform to promote the recruitment of DNA repair factors to the sites of DNA damage that bind via their PAR-binding domains (PBDs). Several classes of PBD families have been identified, which recognize distinct parts of the PAR chain. Proteins encoding PBDs play an essential role in conveying the PAR-mediated signal through their interaction with PAR chains, which mediates many cellular functions, including the DDR. The WWE domain, encoded in 12 human proteins, identifies the iso-ADP-ribose moiety of the PAR chain. PARylation is a heterogeneous structure that is highly dynamic in cells. Capturing the dynamics of PARylation is essential to understanding its role in the DDR, which can be achieved by expanding the tool kit for PAR detection and tracking mediated by the unique binding capability of various sensors. We recently described the WWE domain of RNF146 as a robust genetically encoded probe, when fused to EGFP, for the detection of PAR in live cells. Expanding on this, we used structural prediction tools to evaluate all of the WWE domains encoded in human proteins, evaluating each as molecular PAR probes in live cells. We demonstrate unique PAR dynamics when tracked by WWE-encoded PAR binding domains, in addition to an engineered macrodomain, that can be exploited for modulation of the PAR-dependent DNA damage response.",

Genetically tagging fluorescent RNA reporters to an RNA of interest allows for investigating RNA spatiotemporal dynamics. We previously developed a fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM)-based RNA-tagging platform, Riboglow-FLIM. Here, a genetically encoded RNA tag binds a fluorescent probe, causing an increase in both fluorescence intensity and fluorescence lifetime. Importantly, the Riboglow platform is derived from a bacterial riboswitch RNA family and different riboswitch sequences from nature may build the basis for multiplexing capabilities. We previously observed fluorescence lifetime differences for two RNA tags <i>in vitro</i> and in live mammalian cells as a proof-of-concept demonstration. As an in-depth expansion for multiplexing capabilities, here we evaluate the performance of different RNA sequences <i>in vitro</i> for systematically expanding the RNA tag sequence space of Riboglow-FLIM. We use two methods of varying the genetic tag to evaluate multiplexing capabilities, a literature-guided and a rational design approach. The literature-guided approach includes riboswitch sequences with both indirect and direct evidence of probe binding. For this, a phylogenetic tree of riboswitch-derived tags from indirect binding results was constructed, and RNA members from different branches were characterized. We also designed RNA mutations rationally based on insights from established Riboglow RNA tags. Together, nine different RNA tags yielded a wide range of fluorescence lifetimes for the Riboglow-FLIM platform, building the foundation to tag and track several different RNAs simultaneously.

        "abstract": "Dipeptidyl peptidases 8 and 9 (DPP8/9) are critical for the quality control of mitochondrial and endoplasmic reticulum protein import, immune regulation, cell adhesion, and cell migration. Dysregulation of DPP8/9 is associated with pathologies including tumorigenesis and inflammation. Commonly, DPP8/9 activity is analysed by in vitro assays using artificial substrates, which allow neither continuously monitoring DPP8/9 activity in individual, living cells nor detecting effects from endogenous interactors and posttranslational modifications. Here, we developed DiPAK (for DPP8/9 activity sensor based on AK2), a ratiometric genetically encoded fluorescent sensor, which enables studying DPP8/9 activity in living cells. Using DiPAK, we determined the dynamic range of DPP8/9 activity in cells overexpressing or lacking DPP9. We identified distinct activity levels among melanoma cell lines and found that LPS-induced primary B-cell activation depends on DPP8/9 as the absence of DPP8/9 activity results in apoptotic but not pyroptotic cell death. Consistently, we observed increasing DPP8/9 activity during B-cell maturation. Overall, DiPAK is a versatile tool for real-time single-cell monitoring of DPP8/9 activity in a broad range of cells and organisms.",

        "abstract": "Adenosine (Ado), a nucleoside bridging intracellular metabolism with intercellular communication, plays an essential role in regulating processes such as sleep and seizure. While the functions of extracellular Ado (\"eAdo\") are well documented, our knowledge about the distribution and regulatory functions of intracellular Ado (\"iAdo\") is limited by a lack of methods for detecting iAdo in vivo. Here, we develop HypnoS, a genetically encoded fluorescent sensor for iAdo characterized by its high sensitivity, specificity, spatiotemporal resolution, and rapid response (sub-seconds). HypnoS enables real-time visualization of iAdo dynamics in live cultures, acute brain slices, flies, and freely moving mice. Using HypnoS for dual-color mesoscopic imaging in mice, we show that seizure-induced iAdo waves propagated across the cortex, following calcium signals. Additionally, two-photon imaging reveals that iAdo decays more rapidly in astrocytes than in neurons during seizures. Moreover, by recording iAdo dynamics in the basal forebrain during the sleep-wake cycle, we observe that iAdo signals are present during wakefulness and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, regulated by equilibrative nucleoside transporters (ENT1/2). Thus, HypnoS is a versatile and powerful tool for investigating the biological functions of iAdo across a range of physiological and pathological states.",

However, lifetime-readout sensors are poorly understood at a molecular level, complicating their development. Although there are many sensors that have fluorescence-intensity changes, there are currently only a few with fluorescence-lifetime changes. Here, we optimized two biosensors for thiol-disulfide redox (RoTq-Off and RoTq-On) with opposite changes in fluorescence lifetime in response to oxidation. Using biophysical approaches, we showed that the high-lifetime states of these sensors lock the chromophore more firmly in place than their low-lifetime states do. Two-photon fluorescence lifetime imaging of RoTq-On fused to a glutaredoxin (Grx1) enabled robust, straightforward monitoring of cytosolic glutathione redox state in acute mouse brain slices. The motional mechanism described here is probably common and may inform the design of other lifetime-readout sensors; the Grx1-RoTq-On fusion sensor will be useful for studying glutathione redox in physiology.",

However, progress in developing red-shifted GECIs, despite their advantages over green indicators, has been slower, resulting in fewer options for end users. In this study, we explored topological inversion and soma-targeting strategies, which are complementary to conventional mutagenesis, to re-engineer a red genetically encoded calcium indicator, FRCaMP, for enhanced in vivo performance. The resulting sensors, FRCaMPi and soma-targeted FRCaMPi (SomaFRCaMPi), exhibit up to 2-fold higher dynamic range and peak ΔF/F0 per single AP compared to widely used jRGECO1a in neurons both in culture and in vivo. Compared to jRGECO1a and FRCaMPi, SomaFRCaMPi reduces erroneous correlation of neuronal activity in the brains of mice and zebrafish by two- to 4-fold due to diminished neuropil contamination without compromising the signal-to-noise ratio. Under wide-field imaging in primary somatosensory and visual cortices in mice with high labeling density (80-90%), SomaFRCaMPi exhibits up to 40% higher SNR and decreased artifactual correlation across neurons. Altogether, SomaFRCaMPi improves the accuracy and scale of neuronal activity imaging at single-neuron resolution in densely labeled brain tissues due to a 2-3-fold enhanced automated neuronal segmentation, 50% higher fraction of responsive cells, up to 2-fold higher SNR compared to jRGECO1a. Our findings highlight the potential of SomaFRCaMPi, comparable to the most sensitive soma-targeted GCaMP, for precise spatial recording of neuronal populations using popular imaging modalities in model organisms such as zebrafish and mice.",

In this study, we investigated the impact of Q10 on the spatio-temporal patterns of cellular energetics in keratinocyte-derived HaCaT cells, utilizing the genetically-encoded FRET sensor AMPfret. Engineered from the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), this sensor leverages endogenous affinities of the kinase that evolved to detect energy stress, specifically decreases in ATP/ADP and ATP/AMP ratios that pose a threat to cell survival. We successfully established HaCaT cells stably expressing AMPfret, validated their functionality by inducing energy stress with 2-deoxy-D-glucose, and demonstrated that Q10, together with high glucose conditions in culture, can enhance cellular energetics compared to low glucose controls. We then employed AMPfret to analyze the spatio-temporal response of HaCaT keratinocytes to Luperox (tert-butyl peroxide), a potent organic prooxidant, in the presence of varying intracellular levels of Q10. Preloading cells with Q10 was protective, slowing the speed and reducing the extend of the energy stress response. In contrast, preincubation with Simvastatin, an inhibitor of the mevalonate Q10 biosynthesis pathway, depleted cellular Q10 levels, accelerated the onset of energy stress, and led to early cell death as compared to controls. Under all conditions, AMPfret revealed cell-to-cell heterogeneity in energy stress at baseline and in the response to Luperox. Overall, tracking changes in energy state in time and at single-cell level allows further insights into the beneficial role of Q10 in enhancing cellular bioenergetics in skin cells, and a potential role of AMPK in mediating responses to altered Q10 levels.",

        "abstract": "Genetically encoded phosphorescent proteins with extended luminescence lifetimes provide an orthogonal channel for biological imaging and detection. While conventional fluorescent proteins typically exhibit nanosecond-scale lifetimes, the development of proteins with longer lifetimes enables time-resolved detection and enhanced signal-to-noise ratios. Here, we designed a novel phosphorescent protein system by incorporating photosensitizing unnatural amino acids (UAAs) proximal to the metal center of a lanthanide binding protein (LanM). Through systematic optimization of the incorporation sites, we achieved considerable enhancement in lanthanide phosphorescence compared with that of the wild-type LanM protein. The subsequent directed evolution of LanM and chemical evolution of UAA yielded variants with an additional muti-fold increase in signal intensity. This iterative optimization strategy generated phosphorescent proteins with extended lifetimes of up to 500 μs and significantly increased brightness. Using this phosphorescence protein platform, a europium sensor with a signal-to-noise ratio of more than 100 for 200 nM Eu(III) and a detection limit of less than 10 nM was developed. In addition, a protease sensor was further designed by inserting a cleavage site into a loop of the phosphorescent protein, achieving remarkable signal-to-noise ratios at nanomolar concentrations. Finally, this phosphorescent protein was fused to the affibody and further used for immunofluorescence imaging. These applications demonstrated a novel platform for developing genetically encoded sensors with enhanced detection sensitivity through time-resolved measurements.",

The eSylite design minimizes a spatial dye offset and thereby enables visualization of PSD-95 with improved localization precision and further time-resolved discrimination.

Male mice were tested under different conditions to assess whether hunger, time of day, or the caloric content of the solution they were given affected histamine fluctuations. We found that histamine levels changed rapidly in response to eating. These histamine fluctuations were influenced by experimental conditions, with slightly smaller responses when the test solution was sucralose (both regions) or during the light cycle (PVH only). Notable regional differences were identified, such that in the PVH histamine rebounded to baseline levels, whereas in the VMH histamine remained lower than baseline for at least 10 seconds after licking ceased. In a separate cohort of male and female mice, enhancing histamine tone via administration of a histamine precursor (L-histidine) reduced the number of licks across multiple sucrose concentrations. Together, these findings indicate that histaminergic activity is modulated rapidly during ingestive episodes, and that understanding these release patterns will give insight into histamine's role in appetite suppression.",

In addition to D2HGlo's potential clinical utility, we also present findings for its adaptation to the cellular environment. To assess D-2-HG production in living immortalized glioma cells, we engineered D2HGlo sensors that localize to subcellular compartments, which yielded findings of elevated D-2-HG in the cytosol, mitochondria, and nucleus of IDH1 mutant cells. D2HGlo was used to perform a side-by-side comparison of cytosolic and secreted D-2-HG to reveal that glycolysis, but not glutamine catabolism, drives D-2-HG production in IDH1 mutant cells.",

        "abstract": "Mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP, ΔΨm) is critical for mitochondrial functions, including ATP synthesis, ion transport, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and the import of proteins encoded by the nucleus. Existing methods for measuring ΔΨm typically use lipophilic cation dyes, such as Rhodamine 800 and tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester (TMRM), but these are limited by low specificity and are not well-suited for in vivo applications. To address these limitations, we have developed a novel protocol utilizing genetically encoded voltage indicators (GEVIs). Genetically encoded voltage indicators (GEVIs), which generate fluorescent signals in response to membrane potential changes, have demonstrated significant potential for monitoring plasma membrane and neuronal potentials. However, their application to mitochondrial membranes remains unexplored. Here, we developed protein-based mitochondrial-targeted GEVIs capable of detecting ΔΨm fluctuations in cells and the motor cortex of living animals. The mitochondrial potential indicator (MPI)offers a non-invasive approach to study ΔΨm dynamics in real-time, providing a method to investigate mitochondrial function under both normal and pathological conditions.",

Among GEVIs, near-infrared-shifted GEVIs offer faster kinetics, better tissue penetration, and compatibility with optogenetic tools, enabling all-optical electrophysiology in complex biological contexts. In our previous work, we employed the directed molecular evolution of microbial rhodopsin Archaerhodopsin-3 (Arch-3) in mammalian cells to develop a voltage sensor called Archon1. Archon1 demonstrated excellent membrane localization, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), sensitivity, kinetics, and photostability, and full compatibility with optogenetic tools. However, Archon1 suffers from low brightness and requires high illumination intensities, which leads to tissue heating and phototoxicity during prolonged imaging. In this study, we aim to improve the brightness of this voltage sensor. We performed random mutation on a bright Archon derivative and identified a novel variant, monArch, which exhibits satisfactory voltage sensitivity (4~5% ΔF/F<sub>AP</sub>) and a 9-fold increase in basal brightness compared with Archon1. However, it is hindered by suboptimal membrane localization and compromised voltage sensitivity. These challenges underscore the need for continued optimization to achieve an optimal balance of brightness, stability, and functionality in rhodopsin-based voltage sensors.",

        "abstract": "Neuronal communication is mediated by synaptic transmission, which depends primarily on the release of neurotransmitters stored in synaptic vesicles (SVs) in response to an action potential (AP). Since SVs are recycled locally at the presynaptic terminal, coordination of SV exocytosis and endocytosis is important for sustained synaptic transmission. A pH-sensitive green fluorescent protein, called pHluorin, provides a powerful tool to monitor SV exo/endocytosis by targeting it to the SV lumen. However, tracking AP-driven SV recycling with the pHluorin-based probes is still largely limited to in vitro culture preparations because the introduction of genetically encoded probes and subsequent optical imaging is technically challenging in general for in vivo animal models or tissue preparations. Zebrafish is a model system offering valuable features, including ease of genetic manipulation, optical clarity, and rapid external development. We recently generated a transgenic zebrafish that highly expresses a pHluorin-labeled probe at motor neuron terminals and developed a protocol to monitor AP-driven SV exo/endocytosis at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ), a well-established synapse model that forms in vivo. In this article, we show how to prepare larval zebrafish NMJ preparation suitable for pHluorin imaging. We also show that the preparation allows time-lapse imaging under conventional upright epifluorescence microscope, providing a cost-effective platform for analyzing NMJ function.",

We demonstrate imaging of PTEN activity in cell lines, intact Caenorhabditis elegans and in the mouse brain.

We then used widefield fluorescent imaging to measure V1 dynamics in response to visual stimuli with diverse temporal waveforms and contrasts, and compared these responses to signals measured using a genetically encoded calcium indicator (GECI) and a synthetic voltage-sensitive dye (VSD). When compared to GECI, GEVI captures faster response dynamics, tracks higher temporal frequencies, and responds to lower contrasts. To quantitatively characterize these three signals, we developed a simple nonlinear model that predicts the response dynamics to stimuli with arbitrary temporal waveforms and contrasts.

In this study, we explored topological inversion and soma-targeting strategies, which are complementary to conventional mutagenesis, to re-engineer a red genetically encoded calcium indicator, FRCaMP, for enhanced <i>in vivo</i> performance. The resulting sensors, FRCaMPi and soma-targeted FRCaMPi (SomaFRCaMPi), exhibit up to 2-fold higher dynamic range and peak ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> per single AP compared to widely used jRGECO1a in neurons in culture and <i>in vivo</i>.

This assay enables screening of membrane micropeptides and small molecules that modulate SERCA and Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase activity and may facilitate development of therapies that target cellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling. Of the micropeptides tested, phospholamban (PLB) had the greatest degree of inhibition of SERCA, as measured by a decrease in ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> content compared to control. Sarcolipin (SLN), endoregulin (ELN), and another-regulin (ALN) also decreased ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> content, though less potently than PLB. We also investigated micropeptides that have been shown to have a positive effect on ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake. Dwarf open reading frame (DWORF), a positive modulator of SERCA activity, and phospholemman (PLM), an inhibitor of the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase, both increased ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> content compared to control. A superinhibitory variant of PLM, R70C, further increased ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> load compared to wild type PLM. Overall, our findings indicate that the inhibitory potency of micropeptides is governed by their relative binding affinities to SERCA. This allows for finely tuned modulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling in different tissues based on differential expressions of micropeptide species. Understanding the contribution of each micropeptide to SERCA regulation may reveal novel strategies for therapeutic intervention in conditions where calcium dysregulation plays a role, such as heart disease, vascular disease, or neurodegenerative disorders.",

        "abstract": "Oxidative stress is a prominent feature of Alzheimer's disease. Within this context, cholesterol undergoes oxidation, producing the pro-inflammatory product 7-ketocholesterol (7-KC). In this study, we observe elevated levels of 7-KC in the brains of the 3xTg mouse model of AD. To further understand the contribution of 7-KC on the oxidative environment, we developed a method to express a genetically encoded fluorescent hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) sensor in astrocytes, the primary source of cholesterol in the brain. With this sensor, we discovered that 7-KC increases H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> levels in astrocytes in vivo, but not when directly applied to astrocytes in vitro. Interestingly, when 7-KC was applied to a microglia cell line alone or mixed astrocyte and microglia cultures, it resulted in microglia activation and increased oxidative stress in astrocytes. Depletion of microglia from 3xTg mice resulted in reduced 7-KC in the brains of these mice. Taken together, these findings suggest that 7-KC, acting through microglia, contributes to increased astrocyte oxidative stress in AD. This study sheds light on the complex interplay between cholesterol oxidation, microglia activation, and astrocyte oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of AD.",

        "abstract": "The persistence of cocaine-evoked adaptations relies on gene regulations within the reward circuit, especially in the ventral striatum (i.e., nucleus accumbens [NAc]). Notably, activation of the ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) pathway in the striatum is known to trigger a transcriptional program shaping long-term responses to cocaine. Nuclear calcium signaling has also been shown to control multiple forms of transcription-dependent neuroadaptations, but the dynamics and roles of striatal nuclear calcium signaling in preclinical models of addiction remain unknown. A genetically encoded cell type-specific nuclear calcium probe has been developed to monitor calcium dynamics in the nuclei of striatal neurons, including in freely moving mice. A cell type-specific inhibitor of nuclear calcium signaling combined with 3-dimensional imaging of neuronal morphology, immunostaining, and behavior was used to disentangle the roles of nuclear calcium in NAc medium spiny neurons (MSNs) expressing the dopamine D<sub>1</sub> receptor (D1R) or D<sub>2</sub> receptor (D2R) on cocaine-evoked responses. The D1R-mediated potentiation of calcium influx through glutamate NMDA receptors, which shapes cocaine effects, also drives nuclear calcium transients. Fiber photometry revealed that cocaine-treated mice showed a sustained nuclear calcium increase in NAc D1R-MSNs. Disrupting nuclear calcium in D1R-MSNs, but not D2R-MSNs, blocked cocaine-evoked morphological changes of MSNs and gene expression and blunted cocaine's rewarding effects. Our study unravels the dynamics and roles of cocaine-induced nuclear calcium signaling increases in D1R-MSNs on molecular, cellular, and behavioral adaptations to cocaine and represents a significant breakthrough because it could contribute to the development of innovative strategies with therapeutic potential to alleviate addiction symptoms.",

We found that Arg levels in MDA-MB-231 cells decreased after depletion of extracellular Arg with a concomitant decline in cell viability.

However, the inherent features of protein clustering, especially for its reversible behavior and subtle microenvironment variation, present significant hurdles in probe chemistry for tracking protein clustering dynamics. Herein, we report a bilateral-tailored chemigenetic probe, in which an \"amphiphilic\" aggregate-induced emission luminogen (AIEgen) QMSO<sub>3</sub>Cl is covalently conjugated to a protein tag that is genetically fused to protein-of-interest (POI). Prior to target POI, the \"amphiphilic\" AIE-active QMSO<sub>3</sub>Cl achieves a completely dark state in both aqueous biological environment and lipophilic organelles, thereby ensuring an ultra-low intrinsic background interference. Upon reaching POI, the combination of synthetic molecule and genetically encoded protein allows for protein clustering-dependent ultra-sensitive response, with a substantial lighting-up fluorescence (67.5-fold) as protein transitions from disassembling to clustering state. Such ultra-high signal-to-noise ratio enables to monitor the dynamic and fate of inositol requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1) clustering/disassembling under both acute and chronic endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in living cells.

        "abstract": "Two or more protein ligands may compete against each other to interact transiently with a protein receptor. While this is a ubiquitous phenomenon in cell signaling, existing technologies cannot identify its kinetic complexity because specific subpopulations of binding events of different ligands are hidden in the averaging process in an ensemble. In addition, the limited time resolution of prevailing methods makes detecting and discriminating binding events among diverse interacting partners challenging. Here, we utilize a genetically encoded nanopore sensor to disentangle competitive protein-protein interactions (PPIs) in a one-on-one and label-free fashion. Our measurements involve binary mixtures of protein ligands of varying binding affinity against the same receptor, which was externally immobilized on the nanopore tip. We use the resistive-pulse technique to monitor the kinetics and dynamics of reversible PPIs without the nanopore confinement, with a high-time bandwidth, and at titratable ligand concentrations. In this way, we systematically evaluate how individual protein ligands take their turn to reside on the receptor's binding site. Further, our single-molecule determinations of these interactions are quantitatively compared with data generated by a two-ligand, one-receptor queuing model. The outcomes of this work provide a fundamental basis for future developments aimed at a better mechanistic understanding of competitive PPIs. Moreover, they may also form a platform in drug development pipelines targeting high-complexity PPIs mediated by protein hubs.",

We developed a novel experimental platform in which tissue is stimulated optogenetically while Vm and CaT are imaged simultaneously. The Vm indicator is an organic dye, while the CaT indicator is genetically encoded. We used cardiac spheroids containing cardiomyocytes and fibroblasts differentiated from human induced pluripotent stem cells as model tissue. The spheroids were genetically encoded with an optogenetic actuator, CheRiff, and the calcium indicator jRCaMP1b. The Vm indicator was the organic dye RH237. CheRiff was excited using blue light (450 nm), and both RH237 and jRCaMP1b were excited using a single band of green light (either 525-575 nm or 558-575 nm). Fluorescence emission was split and imaged by two cameras (CaT: 595-665 nm; Vm: >700 nm). The spheroids were successfully stimulated optogenetically and Vm and CaT were recorded simultaneously without cross-talk using both excitation light bands. The 525-575 nm band produced higher signal-to-noise ratios than the 558-575 nm band, but caused a slight increase in tissue excitability because of CheRiff activation. The optogenetic actuator and CaT indicator are genetically encoded and can be expressed in engineered tissue constructs. In contrast, the Vm indicator is an organic dye that can stain any tissue. This system is well-suited for studying coupling between engineered tissue grafts and host tissue because the two tissue types can be stimulated independently, and tissue activation can be unambiguously attributed to either graft or host.",

Subsequently, we applied GlutaR to investigate how chemical and genetic inhibition of glutamine synthetase (GS) and glutaminase (GLS) differentially alter glutamine levels in subcellular compartments.

These methods typically rely on genetically encoded sensors and actuators to monitor and control neural activity. For microendoscopic calcium imaging, injection of a virus followed by implantation of a lens probe is required to express a calcium sensor and enable optical access to the target brain region. This two-step process poses several challenges, chief among them being the risks associated with mistargeting and/or misalignment between virus expression zone, lens probe and target brain region. Here, an adeno-associated virus (AAV)-eluting polymer coating is engineered for gradient refractive index (GRIN) lenses enabling the expression of a genetically encoded calcium indicator (GCaMP) directly within the brain region of interest upon implantation of the lens. This approach requires only one surgical step and guarantees alignment between GCaMP expression and lens in the brain. Additionally, the slow virus release from these coatings increases the working time for surgical implantation, expanding the brain regions and species amenable to this approach. These enhanced capabilities should accelerate neuroscience research utilizing optical methods and advance the understanding of the neural circuit mechanisms underlying brain function and behavior in health and disease.",

        "abstract": "Measuring ongoing cellular activity is essential to understanding the dynamic functions of biological organisms. The most popular current approach is imaging fluorescence-based genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicators (GECIs). While fluorescent probes are useful in many contexts, bioluminescence-based GECIs-probes that generate light through oxidation of a small-molecule by a luciferase or photoprotein-have several distinct advantages. Because bioluminescent (BL) GECIs do not use the bright extrinsic excitation light required for fluorescence, BL GECIs do not photobleach, do not suffer from nonspecific autofluorescent background, and do not cause phototoxicity. Further, BL GECIs can be applied in contexts where directly shining photons on an imaging target is not possible. Despite these advantages, the use of BL GECIs has to date been limited by their small changes in bioluminescence intensity, high baseline signal at resting Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations, and suboptimal Ca<sup>2+</sup> affinities. Here, we describe a new BL GECI, CaBLAM (Ca<sup>2+</sup> BioLuminescence Activity Monitor), that displays much higher dynamic range than previous BL GECIs and has a Ca<sup>2+</sup> affinity suitable for capturing physiological changes in cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration.

        "abstract": "The calcium cation is a crucial signaling molecule involved in numerous cellular pathways. Beyond its role as a messenger or modulator in intracellular cascades, calcium's function in excitable cells, including nerve impulse transmission, is remarkable. The central role of calcium in nervous activity has driven the rapid development of fluorescent techniques for monitoring this cation in living cells. Specifically, genetically encoded calcium indicators (GECIs) are the most in-demand molecular tools in their class. In this work, we address two issues of calcium imaging by designing indicators based on the successful GCaMP6 backbone and the fluorescent protein BrUSLEE. The first indicator variant (GCaMP6s-BrUS), with a reduced, calcium-insensitive fluorescence lifetime, has potential in monitoring calcium dynamics with a high temporal resolution in combination with advanced microscopy techniques, such as light beads microscopy, where the fluorescence lifetime limits acquisition speed. Conversely, the second variant (GCaMP6s-BrUS-145), with a flexible, calcium-sensitive fluorescence lifetime, is relevant for static measurements, particularly for determining absolute calcium concentration values using fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM). To identify the structural determinants of calcium sensitivity in these indicator variants, we determine their spatial structures. A comparative structural analysis allowed the optimization of the GCaMP6s-BrUS construct, resulting in an indicator variant combining calcium-sensitive behavior in the time domain and enhanced molecular brightness. Our data may serve as a starting point for further engineering efforts towards improved GECI variants with fine-tuned fluorescence lifetimes.",

Disruption of subcellular calcium homeostasis and downstream stress pathways in the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria, including the unfolded protein response (UPR), have been implicated in the pathophysiology of noise-induced hearing loss. However, studies on the association between calcium homeostasis and stress pathways have been limited due to limited ability to measure calcium dynamics in mature-hearing, noise-exposed mice. We used a genetically encoded calcium indicator mouse model in which GCaMP6f is expressed specifically in hair cells or supporting cells under control of Myo15Cre or Sox2Cre, respectively. We performed live calcium imaging and UPR gene expression analysis in 8-week-old mice exposed to levels of noise that cause cochlear synaptopathy (98 db sound pressure level [SPL]) or permanent hearing loss (106 dB SPL). UPR activation occurred immediately after noise exposure, and the pattern of UPR activation was dependent on noise level, with the proapoptotic pathway upregulated only after 106 dB noise exposure. Spontaneous calcium transients in hair cells and intercellular calcium waves in supporting cells, which are present in neonatal cochleae, were quiescent in mature-hearing cochleae but reactivated upon noise exposure. Noise exposure of 106 dB was associated with more persistent and expansive intercellular Ca2+ signaling wave activity. These findings demonstrate a strong and dose-dependent association between noise exposure, UPR activation, and changes in calcium homeostasis in hair cells and supporting cells, suggesting that targeting these pathways may be effective to develop treatments for noise-induced hearing loss.",

        "abstract": "Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) adopt ensembles of rapidly fluctuating heterogeneous conformations, influencing their binding capabilities and supramolecular transitions. The primary conformational descriptors for understanding IDP ensembles-the radius of gyration (<i>R</i><sub>G</sub>), measured by small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), and the root mean square (rms) end-to-end distance (<i>R</i><sub>E</sub>), probed by fluorescent resonance energy transfer (FRET)-are often reported to produce inconsistent results regarding IDP expansion as a function of denaturant concentration in the buffer. This ongoing debate surrounding the FRET-SAXS discrepancy raises questions about the overall reliability of either method for quantitatively studying IDP properties. To address this discrepancy, we introduce a genetically encoded anomalous SAXS (ASAXS) ruler, enabling simultaneous and direct measurements of <i>R</i><sub>G</sub> and <i>R</i><sub>E</sub> without assuming a specific structural model. This ruler utilizes a genetically encoded noncanonical amino acid with two bromine atoms, providing an anomalous X-ray scattering signal for precise distance measurements. Through this approach, we experimentally demonstrate that the ratio between <i>R</i><sub>E</sub> and <i>R</i><sub>G</sub> varies under different denaturing conditions, highlighting the intrinsic properties of IDPs as the primary source of the observed SAXS-FRET discrepancy rather than shortcomings in either of the two established methods.

Although there have been reports of both synthetic and genetically encoded fluorescent K<sup>+</sup> indicators, there remains a need for an indicator that is genetically targetable, has high specificity for K<sup>+</sup> versus Na<sup>+</sup>, and has a high fluorescent response in the red to far-red wavelength range. Here, we introduce a series of chemigenetic K<sup>+</sup> indicators, designated as the HaloKbp1 series, based on the bacterial K<sup>+</sup>-binding protein (Kbp) inserted into HaloTag7 self-labeled with environmentally sensitive rhodamine derivatives. This series of high-performance indicators features high brightness in the red to far-red region, large intensiometric fluorescence changes, and a range of <i>K</i><sub>d</sub> values.

        "abstract": "The mammalian or mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) is activated on the surface of lysosomes and phosphorylates substrates at various subcellular locations, including the lysosome, cytosol, and nucleus. However, the signaling and biological functions of nuclear mTORC1 (nmTORC1) are not well understood, primarily due to limited tools for monitoring mTORC1 activity in the nucleus. In this study, we developed a genetically encoded nmTORC1 sensor, termed nTORSEL, based on the phosphorylation of the eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) binding protein 1 (4EBP1) by mTORC1 within the nucleus. nTORSEL, like its predecessor TORSEL, exhibits a fluorescent punctate pattern in the nucleus through multivalent protein-protein interactions between oligomerized 4EBP1 and eIF4E when nmTORC1 activity is low. We validated nTORSEL using biochemical analyses and imaging techniques across representative cell lines with varying levels of nmTORC1 activity. Notably, nTORSEL specifically detects physiological, pharmacological, and genetic inhibition of nmTORC1 in mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells but not in HEK293T cells. Therefore, nTORSEL is an effective tool for investigating nuclear mTORC1 signaling in cell lines.",

        "abstract": "Plasmodium male and female gametocytes are the gatekeepers of human-to-mosquito transmission, therefore essential for propagation of malaria within a population. Whilst dormant in humans, their divergent roles during transmission become apparent soon after mosquito feeding with a rapid transformation into gametes - males forming eight motile sperm-like cells aiming to fertilise a single female gamete. Little is known about how the parasite fuels this abrupt change, and the potential role played by their large and elaborate cristate mitochondrion. Using a sex-specific antibody and functional mitochondrial labelling, we show that the male gametocyte mitochondrion is less active than that of female gametocytes and more sensitive to antimalarials targeting mitochondrial energy metabolism. Rather than a vestigial organelle discarded during male gametogenesis, we demonstrate that mitochondrial ATP synthesis is essential for its completion. Additionally, using a genetically encoded ratiometric ATP sensor, we show that gametocytes can maintain cytoplasmic ATP homeostasis in the absence of mitochondrial respiration, indicating the essentiality of the gametocyte mitochondrion for transmission alone. Together, this reveals how gametocytes responsively balance the conflicting demands of a dormant and active lifestyle, highlighting the mitochondria as a rich source of transmission-blocking targets for future drug development.",

Mitochondrion acts as a Ca<sup>2+</sup> sink and a central player for maintaining Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis. Accurately monitoring Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients within the mitochondrial matrix that undergo constant pH fluctuations is challenging, as signals of most currently available GECIs suffer from artifacts induced by physiological pH variations.

Results from molecular dynamics simulations and <i>ab initio</i> calculations revealed that the deprotonation of the chromophore may be responsible for the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent changes in TurCaMP signals. TurCaMP sensors showed inverse response to Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients, and their responses were not affected by pH changes within the range of pH 6-9.

Maturation of active insulin occurs within insulin secretory granules (ISG) by acidification of the lumen and enzymatic cleavage of insulin before secretion. This process is dysregulated in diabetes, and many questions remain on how the cell controls insulin maturation. We address this gap in knowledge by designing two genetically encoded fluorescence pH sensors and a fluorescence lifetime imaging and analysis pipeline to monitor the pH of individual secretory ISGs within live cells at higher resolution and precision than previously possible. We observed different subpopulations of ISGs based on their pH and subcellular localization. Signals regulating metabolism vs membrane depolarization mobilize different subpopulations of ISGs for secretion, and we confirm that maturation signals acidify ISGs. We conclude that different signaling networks uniquely impact ISG mobilization and secretion. Future applications of these tools will be useful for exploring how these processes are dysregulated in diabetes and provide new paths for developing more effective treatments.",

However, biosensors for imaging sulfate ions, the fourth most abundant physiological anion, in mammalian cells are still lacking. Here, we report the development and characterization of a green fluorescent biosensor for sulfate named Thyone. Thyone, derived through structure-guided design from bright green fluorescent protein mNeonGreen, exhibited a large negative fluorescence response upon subsecond association with sulfate anion with an affinity of 11 mM in mammalian cells. By integrating mutagenesis analyses with molecular dynamics simulations, we elucidated the molecular mechanism of sulfate binding and revealed key amino acid residues responsible for sulfate sensitivity. High anion selectivity and sensitivity of Thyone allowed for imaging of sulfate anion transients mediated by sulfate transporter heterologously expressed in cultured mammalian cells.

        "abstract": "Extensive phosphorylation at serine 22 (pSer22) on lamin A is the hallmark of cell mitosis, which contributes to the breakdown of nuclear envelope. In the interphase, pSer22 lamin A exists in low abundance and is involved in mechanotransduction, virus infection, and gene expression. Numerous evidences emerge to support lamin A regulation on cell function and fate by phosphorylation. However, live-cell imaging tools for visualizing the dynamics of pSer22 lamin A are yet to be established. Herein, we developed a novel lamin A phosphorylation sensor (LAPS) based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) with high sensitivity and specificity. We observed the dynamic lamin A phosphorylation during the cell cycle progression in single living cells: the increase of pSer22 modification when cells entered the mitosis and recovered upon the mitosis exit. Our biosensor also showed the gradual reduction of pSer22 modification during cell adhesion and in response to hypotonic environment. By applying LAPS, we captured the propagation of pSer22 modification from inside to outside of the inner nuclear membrane, which further led to the breakdown of nuclear envelope. Meanwhile, we found the synchronous phosphorylation of pSer22 lamin A and H3S10ph at mitosis entry. Inhibition of Aurora B, the responsible kinase for H3S10ph, could shorten the mitotic period without obvious effect on the pSer22 modification level of lamin A. Thus, LAPS allows the spatiotemporal visualization of the lamin A pSer22, which will be useful for elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying cell mitosis and mechanoresponsive processes.",

        "abstract": "Real-time and non-invasive monitoring of neuronal differentiation will help increase our understanding of neuronal development and help develop regenerative stem cell therapies for neurodegenerative diseases. Traditionally, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), western blotting, and immunofluorescence (IF) staining have been widely used to investigate stem cell differentiation; however, their limitations include endpoint analysis, invasive nature of monitoring, and lack of single-cell-level resolution. Several limitations hamper current approaches to studying neural stem cell (NSC) differentiation. In particular, fixation and staining procedures can introduce artificial changes in cellular morphology, hindering our ability to accurately monitor the progression of the process and fully understand its functional aspects, particularly those related to cellular connectivity and neural network formation. Herein, we report a novel approach to monitor neuronal differentiation of NSCs non-invasively in real-time using cell-based biosensors (CBBs). Our research efforts focused on utilizing intein-mediated protein engineering to design and construct a highly sensitive biosensor capable of detecting a biomarker of neuronal differentiation, hippocalcin. Hippocalcin is a critical protein involved in neurogenesis, and the CBB functions by translocating a fluorescence signal to report the presence of hippocalcin externally. To construct the hippocalcin sensor proteins, hippocalcin bioreceptors, AP2 and glutamate ionotropic receptor AMPA-type subunit 2 (GRIA2), were fused to each split-intein carrying split-nuclear localization signal (NLS) peptides, respectively, and a fluorescent protein was introduced as a reporter. Protein splicing (PS) was triggered in the presence of hippocalcin to generate functional signal peptides, which promptly translocated the fluorescence signal to the nucleus. The stem cell-based biosensor showed fluorescence signal translocation only upon neuronal differentiation. Undifferentiated stem cells or cells that had differentiated into astrocytes or oligodendrocytes did not show fluorescence signal translocation. The number of differentiated neurons was consistent with that measured by conventional IF staining. Furthermore, this approach allowed for the monitoring of neuronal differentiation at an earlier stage than that detected using conventional approaches, and the translocation of fluorescence signal was monitored before the noticeable expression of class III β-tubulin (TuJ1), an early neuronal differentiation marker. We believe that these novel CBBs offer an alternative to current techniques by capturing the dynamics of differentiation progress at the single-cell level and by providing a tool to evaluate how NSCs efficiently differentiate into specific cell types, particularly neurons.",

Arc transcription is induced within a few minutes of stimulation, making it a useful marker for neuronal activity. However, the specific neuronal activity patterns that initiate Arc transcription have remained elusive due to the inability to observe mRNA transcription in live cells in real time. Using a genetically encoded RNA indicator (GERI) mouse model that expresses endogenous Arc mRNA tagged with multiple GFPs, we investigated Arc transcriptional activity in response to various electrical field stimulation patterns. The GERI mouse model was generated by crossing the Arc-PBS knock-in mouse, engineered with binding sites in the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of Arc mRNA, and the transgenic mouse expressing the cognate binding protein fused to GFP. In dissociated hippocampal neurons, we found that the pattern of stimulation significantly affects Arc transcription. Specifically, theta-burst stimulation consisting of high-frequency (100 Hz) bursts delivered at 10 Hz frequency induced the highest rate of Arc transcription. Concurrently, the amplitudes of nuclear calcium transients also reached their peak with 10 Hz burst stimulation, indicating a correlation between calcium concentration and transcription. However, our dual-color single-cell imaging revealed that there were no significant differences in calcium amplitudes between Arc-positive and Arc-negative neurons upon 10 Hz burst stimulation, suggesting the involvement of other factors in the induction of Arc transcription. Our live-cell RNA imaging provides a deeper insight into the complex regulation of transcription by activity patterns and calcium signaling pathways.",

        "abstract": "The objective of our study was to develop a genetically encoded biosensor for quantification of Nedd8, a post-translational modifier that regulates cellular signals through conjugation to other proteins. Perturbations in the balance of free (i.e., unconjugated) and conjugated Nedd8 caused by defects in Nedd8 enzymes or cellular stress are implicated in various diseases. Despite the biological and biomedical importance of Nedd8 dynamics, no method exists for direct quantification of free Nedd8, hindering the study of Nedd8 and activities of its associated enzymes. Genetically encoded biosensors are established as tools to study other dynamic systems, but limitations of current biosensor design methods make them poorly suited for free Nedd8 quantification. We have developed a modular method to design genetically encoded biosensors that employs a target binding domain and two reporter domains positioned on opposite sides of the target binding site. Target quantification is based on competition between target binding and the interaction of the reporter domains. We applied our design strategy to free Nedd8 quantification by developing a selective binder for free Nedd8 and combining it with fluorescent or split nanoluciferase reporters. Our sensors produced quantifiable and specific signals for free Nedd8 and enabled real-time monitoring of deneddylation by DEN1 with a physiological substrate. Our sensor design will be useful for high-throughput screening for deneddylation inhibitors, which have potential in treatment of cancers such as acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The modular design strategy can be extended to develop genetically encoded quantitative biosensors for other proteins of interest.",

        "abstract": "HeLa cell transfection with plasmid DNA (pDNA) is widely used to materialize biologicals and as a preclinical test of nucleic acid-based vaccine efficacy. We sought to genetically encode mammalian transfection sensor (Trensor) circuits and test their utility in HeLa cells for detecting molecules and methods for their propensity to influence transfection. We intended these Trensor circuits to be triggered if their host cell was treated with polyplexed pDNA or certain small-molecule modulators of transfection. We prioritized three promoters, implicated by others in feedback responses as cells import and process foreign material and stably integrated each into the genomes of three different cell lines, each upstream of a green fluorescent protein (GFP) open reading frame within a transgene. All three Trensor circuits showed an increase in their GFP expression when their host HeLa cells were incubated with pDNA and the degraded polyamidoamine dendrimer reagent, SuperFect. We next experimentally demonstrated the modulation of PEI-mediated HeLa cell transient transfection by four different small molecules, with Trichostatin A (TSA) showing the greatest propensity to boost transgene expression. The Trensor circuit based on the <i>TRA2B</i> promoter (Trensor-T) was triggered by incubation with TSA alone and not the other three small molecules. These data suggest that mammalian reporter circuits could enable low-cost, high-throughput screening to identify novel transfection methods and reagents without the need to perform actual transfections requiring costly plasmids or expensive fluorescent labels.",

A targeted nanoplatform based on HER2-specific liposomes whose internal environment contains a genetically encoded BRET sensor was developed in this study to visualize deep-seated tumors characterized by overexpression of human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (HER2).

In the present study, we investigated the effect of dopamine receptor activation on cAMP dynamics in astrocytes of the mouse olfactory bulb, the brain region with the largest population of dopaminergic neurons. Using the genetically encoded cAMP sensor Flamindo2 we visualized changes in the cytosolic cAMP concentration and showed that dopamine application results in a transient increase in cAMP. This cAMP increase could be mimicked by the D1-like receptor agonist A 68930 and was inhibited by the D1-like receptor antagonist SCH 23390, whereas D2-like receptor ligands had no effect on the astrocytic cAMP concentration.

The hermaphroditic nematode Caenorhabditis elegans provides several unique advantages for the study of the OET as it is transparent and has an ordered gonad that produces one mature oocyte every ~23 min at 20 °C. We have modified the genetically encoded calcium indicator jGCaMP7s to fluorescently indicate the moment of fertilization within a living organism. We have termed this reporter \"CaFE\" for Calcium during Fertilization in C. elegans. The CaFE reporter was engineered into a safe harbor locus in single copy, has no significant impact on physiology or fecundity, and produces a robust signal upon fertilization. Here, a series of protocols is presented for utilizing the CaFE reporter as an in vivo tool for dissecting the OET and embryogenesis. We include methods to synchronize worms, examine the effects of RNAi knockdown, mount worms for imaging, and to visualize calcium in oocytes and embryos. Additionally, we present the generation of additional worm strains to aid in this type of analysis. Demonstrating the utility of the CaFE reporter to visualize the timing of fertilization, we report that double ovulation occurs when ipp-5 is targeted by RNAi and that only the first oocyte undergoes immediate fertilization. Furthermore, the discovery of single-cell calcium transients during early embryogenesis is reported here, demonstrating that the CaFE reporter persists into early development. Importantly, the CaFE reporter in worms is simple enough to use for incorporation into course-based undergraduate research (CURE) laboratory classes. The CaFE reporter, coupled with the ordered gonad and ease of RNAi in worms, facilitates inquiry into the cell-cell dynamics required to regulate internal fertilization and early embryogenesis.",

Analyses with an improved channelrhodopsin-2 variant demonstrated that the peristalsis can artificially be generated in the developing gut. These studies unveiled novel functional coordination between different regions along the gut axis. In addition, imaging with GCaMP6s, a genetically encoded calcium indicator, enabled a fine mapping of developmental changes in the peristaltic patterns as Ca2+ signals.

Direct detection of these brief events using existing technologies remains challenging due to their transient nature. In addition, intrinsically disordered domains, intranuclear location, and lack of cofactor-dependent active sites of transcription factors further complicate the quantitative analysis of these critical processes. Here, we create a genetically encoded label-free sensor to identify the interaction between a motif of the MYC transcription factor, a primary cancer driver, and WDR5, a chromatin-associated protein hub. Using an engineered nanopore equipped with this motif, WDR5 is probed through reversible captures and releases in a one-by-one and time-resolved fashion. Our single-molecule kinetic measurements indicate a weak-affinity interaction arising from a relatively slow complex association and a fast dissociation of WDR5 from the tethered motif. Further, we validate this subtle interaction by determinations in an ensemble using single nanodisc-wrapped nanopores immobilized on a biolayer interferometry sensor. This study also provides the proof-of-concept for a sensor that reveals unique recognition signatures of different protein binding sites.

Genetically encoded fluorescent temperature indicators (GETIs) have been developed to visualize intracellular thermogenesis; however, the temperature sensitivity or localization capability in specific organelles should have been further improved to clearly capture when and where intracellular temperature changes at the subcellular level occur. Here, we developed a new GETI, gMELT, composed of donor and acceptor subunits, in which cyan and yellow fluorescent proteins, respectively, as a Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) pair were fused with temperature-sensitive domains. The donor and acceptor subunits associated and dissociated in response to temperature changes, altering the FRET efficiency. Consequently, gMELT functioned as a fluorescence ratiometric indicator. Untagged gMELT was expressed in the cytoplasm, whereas versions fused with specific localization signals were targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or mitochondria. All gMELT variations enabled more sensitive temperature measurements in cellular compartments than those in previous GETIs. The gMELTs, tagged with ER or mitochondrial targeting sequences, were used to detect thermogenesis in organelles stimulated chemically, a method previously known to induce thermogenesis. The observed temperature changes were comparable to previous reports, assuming that the fluorescence readout changes were exclusively due to temperature variations. Furthermore, we demonstrated how macromolecular crowding influences gMELT fluorescence given that this factor can subtly affect the fluorescence readout. Investigating thermogenesis with gMELT, accounting for factors such as macromolecular crowding, will enhance our understanding of intracellular thermogenesis phenomena.",

        "abstract": "During nutrient scarcity, plants can adapt their developmental strategy to maximize their chance of survival. Such plasticity in development is underpinned by hormonal regulation, which mediates the relationship between environmental cues and developmental outputs. In legumes, endosymbiosis with nitrogen-fixing bacteria (rhizobia) is a key adaptation for supplying the plant with nitrogen in the form of ammonium. Rhizobia are housed in lateral root-derived organs termed nodules that maintain an environment conducive to Nitrogenase in these bacteria. Several phytohormones are important for regulating the formation of nodules, with both positive and negative roles proposed for gibberellin (GA). In this study, we determine the cellular location and function of bioactive GA during nodule organogenesis using a genetically encoded second-generation GA biosensor, GIBBERELLIN PERCEPTION SENSOR 2 in Medicago truncatula. We find endogenous bioactive GA accumulates locally at the site of nodule primordia, increasing dramatically in the cortical cell layers, persisting through cell divisions, and maintaining accumulation in the mature nodule meristem. We show, through misexpression of GA-catabolic enzymes that suppress GA accumulation, that GA acts as a positive regulator of nodule growth and development. Furthermore, increasing or decreasing GA through perturbation of biosynthesis gene expression can increase or decrease the size of nodules, respectively. This is unique from lateral root formation, a developmental program that shares common organogenesis regulators. We link GA to a wider gene regulatory program by showing that nodule-identity genes induce and sustain GA accumulation necessary for proper nodule formation.",

Existing genetically encoded force sensors typically rely on fluorescence or bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (FRET or BRET) to visualize tension. However, these force sensing modules are relatively large, and interpreting measurements requires specialized image analysis and careful control experiments. Here, we report a compact molecular tension sensor that generates a bioluminescent signal in response to tension. This sensor (termed PILATeS) makes use of the split NanoLuc luciferase and consists of the <i>H. sapiens</i> titin I10 domain with the insertion of a 10-15 amino acid tag derived from the C-terminal β-strand of NanoLuc. Mechanical load across PILATeS mediates exposure of this tag to recruit the complementary split NanoLuc fragment, resulting in force-dependent bioluminescence. We demonstrate the ability of PILATeS to report biologically meaningful forces by visualizing forces at the interface between integrins and extracellular matrix substrates. We further use PILATeS as a genetically encoded sensor of tension experienced by the mechanosensing protein vinculin. We anticipate that PILATeS will provide an accessible means of visualizing molecular-scale forces in biological systems.",

Here, we developed a new genetically encoded fluorescent sensor, named PLpro-ERNuc, for detection of PLpro activity in living cells using a translocation-based readout. The sensor was designed as follows. A fragment of nsp3 protein was used to direct the sensor on the cytoplasmic surface of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, thus closely mimicking the natural target of PLpro. The fluorescent part included two bright fluorescent proteins-red mScarlet I and green mNeonGreen-separated by a linker with the PLpro cleavage site. A nuclear localization signal (NLS) was attached to ensure accumulation of mNeonGreen into the nucleus upon cleavage. We tested PLpro-ERNuc in a model of recombinant PLpro expressed in HeLa cells. The sensor demonstrated the expected cytoplasmic reticular network in the red and green channels in the absence of protease, and efficient translocation of the green signal into nuclei in the PLpro-expressing cells (14-fold increase in the nucleus/cytoplasm ratio). Then, we used PLpro-ERNuc in a model of Huh7.5 cells infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, where it showed robust ER-to-nucleus translocation of the green signal in the infected cells 24 h post infection. We believe that PLpro-ERNuc represents a useful tool for screening PLpro inhibitors as well as for monitoring virus spread in a culture.",

Herein, we introduce a multiplexed imaging strategy, 'sequential Fluorogenic RNA Imaging-Enabled Sensor' (seqFRIES), which enables live-cell target detection via sequential rounds of imaging-and-stripping. In seqFRIES, multiple orthogonal fluorogenic RNA aptamers are genetically encoded inside cells, and then the corresponding cell membrane permeable dye molecules are added, imaged, and rapidly removed in consecutive detection cycles. As a proof-of-concept, we have identified in this study four fluorogenic RNA aptamer/dye pairs that can be used for highly orthogonal and multiplexed imaging in living bacterial and mammalian cells. After further optimizing the cellular fluorescence activation and deactivation kinetics of these RNA/dye pairs, the whole four-color semi-quantitative seqFRIES process can be completed in ∼20 min. Meanwhile, seqFRIES-mediated simultaneous detection of critical signalling molecules and mRNA targets was also achieved within individual living cells. We expect our validation of this new seqFRIES concept here will facilitate the further development and potential broad usage of these orthogonal fluorogenic RNA/dye pairs for multiplexed and dynamic live-cell imaging and cell biology studies.",

We characterized the affinity, pharmacological profile, spectral properties, kinetics, ligand selectivity, and potential interaction with intracellular signal transducers of NOPLight in vitro. Its functionality was established in acute brain slices by exogeneous N/OFQ application and chemogenetic induction of endogenous N/OFQ release from PNOC neurons. In vivo studies with fibre photometry enabled direct recording of NOPLight binding to exogenous N/OFQ receptor ligands, as well as detection of endogenous N/OFQ release within the paranigral ventral tegmental area (pnVTA) during natural behaviors and chemogenetic activation of PNOC neurons. In summary, we show here that NOPLight can be used to detect N/OFQ opioid peptide signal dynamics in tissue and freely behaving animals.",

We employed the CRISPR-Cas9 system to generate transgenic locusts expressing the genetically encoded calcium indicator GCaMP in olfactory sensory neurons. Using two-photon functional imaging, we mapped the spatial activation patterns representing a wide range of ecologically relevant odors across all six developmental stages. Our findings reveal a functionally ring-shaped organization of the antennal lobe composed of specific glomerular clusters. This configuration establishes an odor-specific chemotopic representation by encoding different chemical classes and ecologically distinct odors in the form of glomerular rings. The ring-shaped glomerular arrangement, which we confirm by selective targeting of OR70a-expressing sensory neurons, occurs throughout development, and the odor-coding pattern within the glomerular population is consistent across developmental stages. Mechanistically, this unconventional spatial olfactory code reflects the locust-specific and multiplexed glomerular innervation pattern of the antennal lobe.",

Abnormalities in lysosomal function are closely linked to diseases, such as lysosomal storage disorders, neurodegeneration, intracellular infections, and cancer among others. Emerging body of research suggests the malfunction of lysosomal hydrolase trafficking pathway to be a common denominator of several disease pathologies. However, available conventional tools to assess lysosomal hydrolase trafficking are insufficient and fail to provide a comprehensive picture about the trafficking flux and location of lysosomal hydrolases. To address some of the shortcomings, we designed a genetically-encoded fluorescent reporter containing a lysosomal hydrolase tandemly tagged with pH sensitive and insensitive fluorescent proteins, which can spatiotemporally trace the trafficking of lysosomal hydrolases. As a proof of principle, we demonstrate that the reporter can detect perturbations in hydrolase trafficking, that are induced by pharmacological manipulations and pathophysiological conditions like intracellular protein aggregates.

Here we investigate responses of PV interneurons in different layers of primary somatosensory barrel cortex (BC) to different excitatory inputs. With the genetically-encoded hybrid voltage sensor, hVOS, we recorded voltage changes in many L2/3 and L4 PV interneurons simultaneously, with stimulation applied to either L2/3 or L4. A semi-automated procedure was developed to identify small regions of interest corresponding to single responsive PV interneurons. Amplitude, half-width, and rise-time were greater for PV interneurons residing in L2/3 compared to L4. Stimulation in L2/3 elicited responses in both L2/3 and L4 with longer latency compared to stimulation in L4. These differences in latency between layers could influence their windows for temporal integration. Thus, PV interneurons in different cortical layers of BC respond in a layer specific and input specific manner, and these differences have potential roles in cortical computations.",

To overcome these limitations and target neurons on the basis of specific PRTs for soma collection and subsequent single-cell RNA sequencing, we developed Voltage-Seq using the genetically encoded voltage indicator Voltron in acute brain slices from mice. We also created an onsite analysis tool, VoltView, to guide soma collection of specific PRTs using a classifier based on a previously acquired database of connectomes from multiple animals. Here we present our procedure for preparing the optical path, the imaging setup and detailing the imaging and analysis steps, as well as a complete procedure for sequencing library preparation. This enables researchers to conduct our high-throughput all-optical synaptic assay and to obtain single-cell transcriptomic data from selected postsynaptic neurons. This also allows researchers to resolve the connectivity ratio of a specific pathway and explore the diversity of PRTs within that connectome. Furthermore, combining high throughput with quick analysis gives unique access to find specific connections within a large postsynaptic connectome. Voltage-Seq also allows the investigation of correlations between connectivity and gene expression changes in a postsynaptic cell-type-specific manner for both excitatory and inhibitory connections.

TORSEL can specifically sense the physiological, pharmacological, and genetic inhibition of mTORC1 signaling in living cells and tissues. Importantly, TORSEL is a valuable tool for imaging-based visual screening of mTORC1 inhibitors. Using TORSEL, we identified histone deacetylase inhibitors that selectively block nutrient-sensing signaling to inhibit mTORC1. TORSEL is a unique living cell sensor that efficiently detects the inhibition of mTORC1 activity, and histone deacetylase inhibitors such as panobinostat target mTORC1 signaling through amino acid sensing.",

        "abstract": "Octopamine (OA), analogous to norepinephrine in vertebrates, is an essential monoamine neurotransmitter in invertebrates that plays a significant role in various biological functions, including olfactory associative learning. However, the spatial and temporal dynamics of OA <i>in vivo</i> remain poorly understood due to limitations associated with the currently available methods used to detect it. To overcome these limitations, we developed a genetically encoded GPCR  activation-based (GRAB) OA sensor called GRAB<sub>OA1.0</sub>. This sensor is highly selective for OA and exhibits a robust and rapid increase in fluorescence in response to extracellular OA. Using GRAB<sub>OA1.0</sub>, we monitored OA release in the <i>Drosophila</i> mushroom body (MB), the fly's learning center, and found that OA is released in response to both odor and shock stimuli in an aversive learning model. This OA release requires acetylcholine (ACh) released from Kenyon cells, signaling via nicotinic ACh receptors. Finally, we discovered that OA amplifies aversive learning behavior by augmenting dopamine-mediated punishment signals via Octβ1R in dopaminergic neurons, leading to alterations in synaptic plasticity within the MB. Thus, our new GRAB<sub>OA1.0</sub> sensor can be used to monitor OA release in real time under physiological conditions, providing valuable insights into the cellular and circuit mechanisms that underlie OA signaling.",

The level of histone H4 Lys20 monomethylation (H4K20me1) increases during the G2 to M phases of the cell cycle and is enriched in facultative heterochromatin, such as inactive X chromosomes in cycling cells. To track the dynamic changes of H4K20me1 in living cells, we have developed a genetically encoded modification-specific intracellular antibody (mintbody) probe that specifically binds to the modification. Here, we report the generation of knock-in mice in which the coding sequence of the mCherry-tagged version of the H4K20me1-mintbody is inserted into the Rosa26 locus. The knock-in mice, which ubiquitously expressed the H4K20me1-mintbody, developed normally and were fertile, indicating that the expression of the probe does not disturb the cell growth, development, or differentiation. Various tissues isolated from the knock-in mice exhibited nuclear fluorescence without the need for fixation. The H4K20me1-mintbody was enriched in inactive X chromosomes in developing embryos and in XY bodies during spermatogenesis.

An increasing amount of evidence suggests that intracellular calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) dynamics in oligodendrocytes mediates activity-dependent and activity-independent myelination. Unraveling how myelinating oligodendrocytes orchestrate and integrate Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals, particularly in relation to axonal firing, is crucial for gaining insights into their role in the CNS development and function, both in health and disease. In this framework, we used the recombinant adeno-associated virus/Olig001 capsid variant to express the genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator jGCaMP8s, under the control of the myelin basic protein promoter. In our study, this tool exhibits excellent tropism and selectivity for myelinating and mature oligodendrocytes, and it allows monitoring Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity in myelin-forming cells, both in isolated primary cultures and organotypic spinal cord explants. By live imaging of myelin Ca<sup>2+</sup> events in oligodendrocytes within organ cultures, we observed a rapid decline in the amplitude and duration of Ca<sup>2+</sup> events across different in vitro developmental stages. Active myelin sheath remodeling and growth are modulated at the level of myelin-axon interface through Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling, and, during early myelination in organ cultures, this phase is finely tuned by the firing of axon action potentials. In the later stages of myelination, Ca<sup>2+</sup> events in mature oligodendrocytes no longer display such a modulation, underscoring the involvement of complex Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in CNS myelination.",

        "abstract": "The accurate and rapid detection of blood lead concentration is of paramount importance for assessing human lead exposure levels. Fluorescent protein-based probes, known for their high detection capabilities and low toxicity, are extensively used in analytical sciences. However, there is currently a shortage of such probes designed for ultrasensitive detection of Pb<sup>2+</sup>, and no reported probes exist for the quantitative detection of Pb<sup>2+</sup> in blood samples. This study aims to fill this critical void by developing and evaluating a novel fluorescent protein-based probe that promises accurate and rapid lead quantification in blood. A simple and small-molecule fluorescent protein-based probe was successfully constructed herein using a peptide PbrBD designed for Pb<sup>2+</sup> recognition coupled to a single fluorescent protein, sfGFP. The probe retains a three-coordinate configuration to identify Pb<sup>2+</sup> and has a high affinity for it with a K<sub>d</sub>' of 1.48 ± 0.05 × 10<sup>-17</sup> M. It effectively transfers the conformational changes of the peptide to the chromophore upon Pb<sup>2+</sup> binding, leading to fast fluorescence quenching and a sensitive response to Pb<sup>2+</sup>. The probe offers a broad dynamic response range of approximately 37-fold and a linear detection range from 0.25 nM to 3500 nM. More importantly, the probe can resist interference of metal ions in living organisms, enabling quantitative analysis of Pb<sup>2+</sup> in the picomolar to millimolar range in serum samples with a recovery percentage of 96.64%-108.74 %. This innovative probe, the first to employ a single fluorescent protein-based probe for ultrasensitive and precise analysis of Pb<sup>2+</sup> in animal and human serum, heralds a significant advancement in environmental monitoring and public health surveillance. Furthermore, as a genetically encoded fluorescent probe, this probe also holds potential for the in vivo localization and concentration monitoring of Pb<sup>2+</sup>.",

In this study we explored the response of intracellular pH (pHi) to a one-minute CO2 pulse using a genetically encoded, ubiquitously expressed pH sensor, tpHusion, to monitor pHi within a live, intact, whole fly. We compared wild-type flies to flies lacking Imaginal disc growth factors (Idgfs), which are chitinase-like proteins that facilitate developmental processes and the innate immune response. Morphogenetic and cytoskeletal defects in Idgf-null flies are enhanced after CO2 exposure. We found that pHi drops sharply within seconds of the beginning of a CO2 pulse and recovers over several minutes. The initial profile was nearly identical in control and Idgf-null flies but diverged as the pHi returned to normal. This study demonstrates the feasibility of monitoring pH in live adult Drosophila.

        "abstract": "Octopamine (OA), analogous to norepinephrine in vertebrates, is an essential monoamine neurotransmitter in invertebrates that plays a significant role in various biological functions, including olfactory associative learning. However, the spatial and temporal dynamics of OA <i>in vivo</i> remain poorly understood due to limitations associated with the currently available methods used to detect it. To overcome these limitations, we developed a genetically encoded GPCR activation-based (GRAB) OA sensor called GRAB<sub>OA1.0</sub>. This sensor is highly selective for OA and exhibits a robust and rapid increase in fluorescence in response to extracellular OA. Using GRAB<sub>OA1.0</sub>, we monitored OA release in the <i>Drosophila</i> mushroom body (MB), the fly's learning center, and found that OA is released in response to both odor and shock stimuli in an aversive learning model. This OA release requires acetylcholine (ACh) released from Kenyon cells, signaling via nicotinic ACh receptors. Finally, we discovered that OA amplifies aversive learning behavior by augmenting dopamine-mediated punishment signals via Octβ1R in dopaminergic neurons, leading to alterations in synaptic plasticity within the MB. Thus, our new GRAB<sub>OA1.0</sub> sensor can be used to monitor OA release in real-time under physiological conditions, providing valuable insights into the cellular and circuit mechanisms that underlie OA signaling.",

        "abstract": "The serotonergic transmitter system plays fundamental roles in the nervous system in neurotransmission, synaptic plasticity, pathological processes, and therapeutic effects of antidepressants and psychedelics, as well as in the gastrointestinal and circulatory systems. We introduce a novel small molecule fluorescent agent, termed <b>SERTlight</b>, that specifically labels serotonergic neuronal cell bodies, dendrites, and axonal projections as a serotonin transporter (SERT) fluorescent substrate. SERTlight was developed by an iterative molecular design process, based on an aminoethyl-quinolone system, to integrate structural elements that impart SERT substrate activity, sufficient fluorescent brightness, and a broad absence of pharmacological activity, including at serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5HT) receptors, other G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), ion channels, and monoamine transporters. The high labeling selectivity is not achieved by high affinity binding to SERT itself but rather by a sufficient rate of SERT-mediated transport of SERTlight, resulting in accumulation of these molecules in 5HT neurons and yielding a robust and selective optical signal in the mammalian brain. SERTlight provides a stable signal, as it is not released via exocytosis nor by reverse SERT transport induced by 5HT releasers such as MDMA. SERTlight is optically, pharmacologically, and operationally orthogonal to a wide range of genetically encoded sensors, enabling multiplexed imaging. SERTlight enables labeling of distal 5HT axonal projections and simultaneous imaging of the release of endogenous 5HT using the GRAB<sub>5HT</sub> sensor, providing a new versatile molecular tool for the study of the serotonergic system.",

Thus, resolving voltage signals in non-excitable cells demands sensors with exceptionally high voltage sensitivity. In this study, the ultrabright, ultrasensitive, and calibratable genetically encoded voltage sensor rEstus is developed using structure-guided engineering. rEstus is most sensitive in the resting voltage range of non-excitable cells and offers a 3.6-fold improvement in brightness change for fast voltage spikes over its precursor ASAP3. Using rEstus, it is uncovered that the membrane voltage in several non-excitable cell lines (A375, HEK293T, MCF7) undergoes spontaneous endogenous alterations on a second to millisecond timescale. Correlation analysis of these optically recorded voltage alterations provides a direct, real-time readout of electrical cell-cell coupling, showing that visually connected A375 and HEK293T cells are also largely electrically connected, while MCF7 cells are only weakly coupled. The presented work provides enhanced tools and methods for non-invasive voltage imaging in living cells and demonstrates that spontaneous endogenous membrane voltage alterations are not limited to excitable cells but also occur in a variety of non-excitable cell types.",

Conventionally, cyan and yellow fluorescent proteins have been often used as FRET pairs. Meanwhile, bathochromically shifted indicators with green and red fluorescent protein pairs have various advantages, such as low toxicity and autofluorescence in cells. However, it remains difficult to develop them with a similar level of dynamic range as cyan and yellow fluorescent protein pairs. To improve this, we used Gamillus, which has a unique trans-configuration chromophore, as a green fluorescent protein. Based on one of the best high-dynamic-range GECIs, Twitch-NR, we developed a GECI with 1.5-times higher dynamic range (253%), Twitch-GmRR, using RRvT as a red fluorescent protein. Twitch-GmRR had high brightness and photostability and was successfully applied for imaging the Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics in live cells.

Calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) transients mediated signaling is known to be essential in cytokinesis across eukaryotic cells. However, the detailed spatiotemporal dynamics of Ca<sup>2+</sup> during plant cytokinesis remain largely unexplored. In this study, we employed GCaMP5, a genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor, to investigate cytokinetic Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients during cytokinesis in Nicotiana tabacum Bright Yellow-2 (BY-2) cells. We validated the effectiveness of GCaMP5 to capture fluctuations in intracellular free Ca<sup>2+</sup> in transgenic BY-2 cells. Our results reveal that Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics during BY-2 cell cytokinesis are distinctly different from those observed in embryonic and yeast cells. It is characterized by an initial significant Ca<sup>2+</sup> spike within the phragmoplast region. This spike is followed by a decrease in Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration at the onset of cytokinesis in phragmoplast, which then remains elevated in comparison to the cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> until the completion of cell plate formation. At the end of cytokinesis, Ca<sup>2+</sup> becomes uniformly distributed in the cytosol. This pattern contrasts with the typical dual waves of Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes observed during cytokinesis in animal embryonic cells and fission yeasts. Furthermore, applications of pharmaceutical inhibitors for either Ca<sup>2+</sup> or microtubules revealed a close correlation between Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients and microtubule organization in the regulation of cytokinesis.

        "abstract": "Genetically encoded reporters for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offer a valuable technology for making molecular-scale measurements of biological processes within living organisms with high anatomical resolution and whole-organ coverage without relying on ionizing radiation. However, most MRI reporters rely on contrast agents, typically paramagnetic metals and metal complexes, which often need to be supplemented exogenously to create optimal contrast. To eliminate the need for contrast agents, we previously introduced aquaporin-1, a mammalian water channel, as a new reporter gene for the fully autonomous detection of genetically labeled cells using diffusion-weighted MRI. In this study, we aimed to expand the toolbox of diffusion-based genetic reporters by modulating aquaporin membrane trafficking and harnessing the evolutionary diversity of water channels across species. We identified a number of new water channels that functioned as diffusion-weighted reporter genes. In addition, we show that loss-of-function variants of yeast and human aquaporins can be leveraged to design first-in-class diffusion-based sensors for detecting the activity of a model protease within living cells.",

However, comprehensive multiscale analysis of lactate metabolic dynamics in vitro and in vivo has remained an unsolved problem until now owing to the lack of a high-performance tool. We recently developed a series of genetically encoded fluorescent sensors for lactate, named FiLa, which illuminate lactate metabolism in cells, subcellular organelles, animals, and human serum and urine. In this protocol, we first describe the FiLa sensor-based strategies for real-time subcellular bioenergetic flux analysis by profiling the lactate metabolic response to different nutritional and pharmacological conditions, which provides a systematic-level view of cellular metabolic function at the subcellular scale for the first time. We also report detailed procedures for imaging lactate dynamics in live mice through a cell microcapsule system or recombinant adeno-associated virus and for the rapid and simple assay of lactate in human body fluids. This comprehensive multiscale metabolic analysis strategy may also be applied to other metabolite biosensors using various analytic platforms, further expanding its usability. The protocol is suited for users with expertise in biochemistry, molecular biology and cell biology. Typically, the preparation of FiLa-expressing cells or mice takes 2 days to 4 weeks, and live-cell and in vivo imaging can be performed within 1-2 hours. For the FiLa-based assay of body fluids, the whole measuring procedure generally takes ~1 min for one sample in a manual assay or ~3 min for 96 samples in an automatic microplate assay.",

Transgenic reporter lines to investigate physiological parameters during stress treatments remain scarce. We generated and characterized transgenic homozygous barley lines (cv. Golden Promise Fast) expressing the genetically encoded biosensor Grx1-roGFP2, which indicates the redox potential of the major antioxidant glutathione in the cytosol. Our results demonstrated functionality of the sensor in living barley plants. We determined the glutathione redox potential (EGSH) of the cytosol to be in the range of -308 mV to -320 mV. EGSH was robust against a combined NaCl (150 mM) and water deficit treatment (-0.8 MPa) but responded with oxidation to infiltration with the phytotoxic secretome of the necrotrophic fungus Botrytis cinerea. The generated reporter lines are a novel resource to study biotic and abiotic stress resilience in barley, pinpointing that even severe abiotic stress leading to a growth delay does not automatically induce cytosolic EGSH oxidation, while necrotrophic pathogens can undermine this robustness.",

To simultaneously visualize extracellular and cytosolic ATP, we developed bicistronic constructs featuring GRAB<sub>ATP1.0</sub> and MaLionR biosensors alongside the calcium sensor RCaMP, enabling multiparametric imaging.

To illuminate this essential anion across such a spectrum of biological processes, researchers have relied on fluorescence imaging with genetically encoded sensors. In large part, these have been derived from the green fluorescent protein found in the jellyfish <i>Aequorea victoria</i>. However, a standalone sensor with a turn-on intensiometric response at physiological pH has yet to be reported. Here, we address this technology gap by building on our discovery of the anion-sensitive fluorescent protein mNeonGreen (mNG). The targeted engineering of two non-coordinating residues, namely K143 and R195, in the chloride binding pocket of mNG coupled with an anion walking screening and selection strategy resulted in the ChlorON sensors: ChlorON-1 (K143W/R195L), ChlorON-2 (K143R/R195I), and ChlorON-3 (K143R/R195L). <i>In vitro</i> spectroscopy revealed that all three sensors display a robust turn-on fluorescence response to chloride (20- to 45-fold) across a wide range of affinities (<i>K</i><sub>d</sub> ≈ 30-285 mM). We further showcase how this unique sensing mechanism can be exploited to directly image labile chloride transport with spatial and temporal resolution in a cell model overexpressing the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator.

        "abstract": "The voltage sensing domain (VSD) is a four-helix modular protein domain that converts electrical signals into conformational changes, leading to open pores and active enzymes. In most voltage sensing proteins, the VSDs do not interact with one another and the S1-S3 helices are considered mainly as scaffolding. The two exceptions are the voltage sensing phosphatase (VSP) and the proton channel (Hv). VSP is a voltage-regulated enzyme and Hvs are channels that only have VSDs. To investigate the S1 contribution to VSP function, we individually mutated four hydrophobic amino acids in S1 to alanine (F127, I131, I134 and L137). We also combined these mutations to generate quadruple mutation designated S1-Q. Most of these mutations shifted the voltage dependence of activity to higher voltages though interestingly, not all substrate reactions were the same. The kinetics of enzymatic activity were also altered with some mutations significantly slowing down dephosphorylation. The voltage dependence of VSD motions were consistently shifted to lower voltages and indicated a second voltage dependent motion. Co-immunoprecipitation demonstrated that none of the mutations broke the VSP dimer indicating that the S1 impact could stem from intrasubunit and/or intersubunit interactions. Lastly, when the same alanine mutations were introduced into a genetically encoded voltage indicator, they dramatically altered the optical readings, making some of the kinetics faster and shifting the voltage dependence. These results indicate that the S1 helix in VSP plays a critical role in tuning the enzymes conformational response to membrane potential transients and influencing the function of the VSD.",

We demonstrate that Necrosensor is able to detect necrosis induced by various stresses in multiple tissues in both live and fixed conditions.

To develop intensiometric sensors with the capacity for ratiometric quantification, dual-FP Matryoshka sensors were generated by using a single cassette with a large Stokes shift (LSS) reference FP nested within the reporter FP (cpEGFP). Here, we present a genetically encoded calcium sensor that employs green apple (GA) Matryoshka technology by incorporating a newly designed red LSSmApple fluorophore. LSSmApple matures faster and provides an optimized excitation spectrum overlap with cpEGFP, allowing for monochromatic coexcitation with blue light. The LSS of LSSmApple results in improved emission spectrum separation from cpEGFP, thereby minimizing fluorophore bleed-through and facilitating imaging using standard dichroic and red FP (RFP) emission filters. We developed an image analysis pipeline for yeast (<i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>) timelapse imaging that utilizes LSSmApple to segment and track cells for high-throughput quantitative analysis.

Here, we create synthetic HSL sensors for Gram-positive <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> 168 using allosteric LuxR-type regulators (RpaR, LuxR, RhlR, and CinR) and synthetic promoters. Promoters were combinatorially designed from different sequence elements (-35, -16, -10, and transcriptional start regions). We quantified the effects of these combinatorial promoters on sensor activity and determined how regulator expression affects its activation, achieving up to 293-fold activation. Using the statistical design of experiments, we identified significant effects of promoter regions and pairwise interactions on sensor activity, which helped to understand the sequence-function relationships for synthetic promoter design.

These methods typically rely on genetically encoded sensors and actuators to monitor and control neural activity. For microendoscopic calcium imaging, injection of a virus followed by implantation of a lens probe is required to express a calcium sensor and enable optical access to the target brain region. This two-step process poses several challenges, chief among them being the risks associated with mistargeting and/or misalignment between virus expression zone, lens probe and target brain region. Here, we engineer an adeno-associated virus (AAV)-eluting polymer coating for gradient refractive index (GRIN) lenses enabling expression of a genetically encoded calcium indicator (GCaMP) directly within the brain region of interest upon implantation of the lens. This approach requires only one surgical step and guarantees alignment between GCaMP expression and lens in the brain. Additionally, the slow virus release from these coatings increases the working time for surgical implantation, expanding the brain regions and species amenable to this approach. These enhanced capabilities should accelerate neuroscience research utilizing optical methods and advance our understanding of the neural circuit mechanisms underlying brain function and behavior in health and disease.",

In this study, we revealed the innervation of the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) by Hcrt neurons in mice. Using the genetically encoded G-protein-coupled receptor activation-based Hcrt sensor, we observed a significant increase in Hcrt levels in the MEC during novel object-place exploration. We identified the function of Hcrt at presynaptic glutamatergic terminals, where it recruits fast-spiking parvalbumin-positive neurons and promotes gamma oscillations. Bidirectional manipulations of Hcrt neurons' projections from the lateral hypothalamus (LH<sub>Hcrt</sub>) to MEC revealed the essential role of this pathway in regulating object-place memory encoding, but not recall, through the modulation of gamma oscillations.

One challenge is a lack of methods for studying the dynamic nature of serotonin metabolism. Here, we report the development of a genetically encoded luminescent biosensor, termed iSero-Rluc, for the real-time detection of serotonin in live cells. The engineered serotonin binding domain (iSero) and Renilla luciferase (Rluc) reporter were cloned into yeast and mammalian expression vectors to create a fusion protein that could act as a biosensor to detect endogenous serotonin levels in live cells. The iSero-Rluc biosensor was stably expressed in the BON cell line and luciferase assays, mass spectroscopy, immunofluorescence, and Western blotting were used to study serotonin metabolism under different cell culture conditions. The iSero-Rluc sensor detected exogenous serotonin in a yeast model. When stably expressed in the BON cell line, iSero-Rluc revealed that serotonin biosynthesis is increased in an anchorage-independent growth state and is induced upon serum starvation. The iSero-Rluc biosensor is a powerful tool in the study of tumor serotonin metabolism. It enabled real-time detection of alterations in serotonin synthesis in living cells under various growth conditions and has the potential to provide greater insight into serotonin metabolism in different stages of tumor progression and to identify therapeutic strategies to target cancer metastases and carcinoid crises.",

Here, we developed a genetically encoded Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based reporter that visualizes the conformational changes in Ca2+-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs/CPKs). We focused on two CDPKs with distinct Ca2+-sensitivities, highly Ca2+-sensitive Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) AtCPK21 and rather Ca2+-insensitive AtCPK23, to report conformational changes accompanying kinase activation. In tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) pollen tubes, which naturally display coordinated spatial and temporal Ca2+ fluctuations, CPK21-FRET, but not CPK23-FRET, reported oscillatory emission ratio changes mirroring cytosolic Ca2+ changes, pointing to the isoform-specific Ca2+-sensitivity and reversibility of the conformational change. In Arabidopsis guard cells, CPK21-FRET-monitored conformational dynamics suggest that CPK21 serves as a decoder of signal-specific Ca2+ signatures in response to abscisic acid and the flagellin peptide flg22.

Our study was aimed at generating a stable cell line co-expressing hTRPV1 receptor and GCaMP6s calcium indicator protein and, based on this, developing high-throughput screening methods for targeting hTRPV1 agonists. The CHO-hTRPV1-GCaMP6s cell line stably expressing hTRPV1 and GCaMP6s was generated by co-transfection of hTRPV1 and GCaMP6s into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. The high-throughput screening methods were developed based on detecting the concentration of intracellular calcium ions ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>) by using chemically synthesized dyes and genetically encoded calcium indicator (GECI). Meanwhile, the sensitivity and adaptability of these methods in the evaluation of capsaicinoids were also compared. A stable cell line co-expressing hTRPV1 and GCaMP6s was generated and used to establish a functional high-throughput screening assay based on the measurement of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> by fluorometric imaging plate reader (FLIPR). The GECI exhibited a higher sensitivity and applicability than that of chemically synthesized dyes in detecting the changes in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> induced by capsaicin.

Several classes of PBD families have been recognized, which identify distinct parts of the PAR chain. Proteins encoding PBDs play an essential role in conveying the PAR-mediated signal through their interaction with PAR chains, which mediates many cellular functions, including the DDR. The WWE domain identifies the iso-ADP-ribose moiety of the PAR chain. We recently described the WWE domain of RNF146 as a robust genetically encoded probe, when fused to EGFP, for detection of PAR in live cells.

Here, the vast mutational landscape of proteins constitutes a significant obstacle that slows GEFI development, particularly for sensors that rely on mammalian host systems for testing. To overcome these obstacles, we developed a multiplexed high-throughput engineering platform called the optogenetic microwell array screening system (Opto-MASS) that functionally tests thousands of GEFI variants in parallel in mammalian cells. Opto-MASS represents the next step for engineering optogenetic tools as it can screen large variant libraries orders of magnitude faster than current methods.

Expanding the selection of available GECIs to include new colors and distinct photophysical properties could create new opportunities for <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> fluorescence imaging of neuronal activity.

        "abstract": "Acrosome exocytosis (AE), in which the sperm's single exocytotic vesicle fuses with the plasma membrane, is a complex, calcium-dependent process essential for fertilization. However, our understanding of how calcium signaling regulates AE is still incomplete. In particular, the interplay between intra-acrosomal calcium dynamics and the intermediate steps leading to AE is not well-defined. Here, we describe a method that provides spatial and temporal insights into acrosomal calcium dynamics and their relationship to membrane fusion and subsequent exocytosis of the acrosome vesicle. The method utilizes a novel transgenic mouse expressing an Acrosome-targeted Sensor for Exocytosis (AcroSensE). The sensor combines a genetically encoded calcium indicator (GCaMP) fused with mCherry. This fusion protein was specifically designed to enable the concurrent observation of acrosomal calcium dynamics and membrane fusion events. Real-time monitoring of acrosomal calcium dynamics and AE in live AcroSensE sperm is achieved using a combination of high frame-rate imaging and a stimulant delivery system that can target single sperm. This protocol also provides several examples of basic methods to quantify and analyze the raw data. Because the AcroSensE model is genetically encoded, its scientific significance can be augmented by using readily available genetic tools, such as crossbreeding with other mouse genetic models or gene-editing (CRISPR) based methods. With this strategy, the roles of additional signaling pathways in sperm capacitation and fertilization can be resolved. In summary, the method described here provides a convenient and effective tool to study calcium dynamics in a specific subcellular compartment-the sperm acrosome-and how those dynamics regulate the intermediate steps leading to membrane fusion and acrosome exocytosis.",

        "abstract": "Biochemical processes within the living cell occur in a highly crowded environment, where macromolecules, first of all proteins and nucleic acids, occupy up to 30% of the volume. The phenomenon of macromolecular crowding is not an exclusive feature of the cytoplasm and can be observed in the densely protein-packed, nonhomogeneous cellular membranes and at the membrane interfaces. Crowding affects diffusional and conformational dynamics of proteins within the lipid bilayer, alters kinetic and thermodynamic properties of biochemical reactions, and modulates the membrane organization. Despite its importance, the non-invasive quantification of the membrane crowding is not trivial. Here, we developed a genetically-encoded fluorescence-based sensor for probing the macromolecular crowding at the membrane interfaces. Two sensor variants, both composed of fluorescent proteins and a membrane anchor, but differing by flexible linker domains were characterized in vitro, and the procedures for the membrane reconstitution were established. Steric pressure induced by membrane-tethered synthetic and protein crowders altered the sensors' conformation, causing increase in the intramolecular Förster's resonance energy transfer. Notably, the effect of protein crowders only weakly correlated with their molecular weight, suggesting that other factors, such as shape and charge contribute to the crowding via the quinary interactions.

To test this, we first evaluated dLight photometry in mouse brain slices with simultaneous FSCV and found that both techniques yielded comparable results, but notable differences in responses to dopamine transporter inhibitors, including cocaine. We then used in vivo fiber photometry with dLight in mice to examine responses to cocaine in DLS. We also compared dopamine responses during Pavlovian conditioning across the striatum. We show that dopamine increases were readily detectable in DLS and describe transient dopamine kinetics, as well as slowly developing signals during conditioning. Overall, our findings indicate that dLight photometry is well suited to measuring dopamine dynamics in DLS.",

By conjugating circularly permuted green fluorescent protein (cp.GFP) to a split hLFABP construct, the biosensor was able to detect perfluorooctanoic acid PFOA in PBS as well as environmental water samples with LODs of 236 and 330 ppb respectively. Furthermore, E. coli cells cytosolically expressing the protein-based sensor were demonstrated to quickly detect PFOA, demonstrating feasibility of whole-cell sensing.

However, genetically encoded sensors with a general design remain to be developed. Here we develop genetically encoded RNA sensors with a modular design for ratiometric and multiplexed imaging of small molecules in live cells. The sensor utilizes aptazyme as a recognition module and the light-up RNA aptamer as a signal reporter. The conformation of light-up aptamers is abrogated by a blocking sequence, and aptazyme-mediated cleavage restores the correct conformation, delivering activated fluorescence for small molecule imaging. We first developed a genetically encoded ratiometric sensor using Mango aptamer as a reference and SRB2 as a reporter. It is shown that the sensor allows quantitative imaging and detection of theophylline in live cells. The generality of the design is further demonstrated for imaging other small molecules by replacing the aptazymes. Its ability for multiplexed imaging of small molecules is further explored via the integration of different small-molecule responsive aptazymes and light-up RNA aptamers.

Despite extensive studies on the regulation of nitrate uptake and downstream responses in various cells, our knowledge of the distribution of nitrogen forms in different root cell types and their cellular compartments is still limited. Previous physiological models have relied on in vitro biochemistry and metabolite level analysis, which limits the ability to differentiate between cell types and compartments. Here, to address this, we report a nuclear-localized, genetically encoded fluorescent biosensor, which we named nlsNitraMeter3.0, for the quantitative visualization of nitrate concentration and distribution at the cellular level in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>. This biosensor was specifically designed for nitrate measurements, not nitrite. Through genetic engineering to create and select sensors using yeast, <i>Xenopus</i> oocyte, and <i>Arabidopsis</i> expression systems, we developed a reversible and highly specific nitrate sensor. This method, combined with fluorescence imaging systems such as confocal microscopy, allows for the understanding and monitoring of nitrate transporter activity in plant root cells in a minimally invasive manner. Furthermore, this approach enables the functional analysis of nitrate transporters and the measurement of nitrate distribution in plants, providing a valuable tool for plant biology research. In summary, we provide a protocol for sensor development and a biosensor that can be used to monitor nitrate levels in plants. Key features This protocol builds upon the concept of FRET biosensors for in vivo visualization of spatiotemporal nitrate levels at a cellular resolution.

GEFIs are complex proteins with multiple dynamic states, rendering optimization by trial-and-error mutagenesis a challenging problem. We applied an alternative approach using machine learning to predict the outcomes of sensor mutagenesis by analyzing established libraries that link sensor sequences to functions. Using the GCaMP calcium indicator as a scaffold, we developed an ensemble of three regression models trained on experimentally derived GCaMP mutation libraries. We used the trained ensemble to perform an in silico functional screen on 1423 novel, uncharacterized GCaMP variants. As a result, we identified the novel ensemble-derived GCaMP (eGCaMP) variants, eGCaMP and eGCaMP+, that achieve both faster kinetics and larger fluorescent responses upon stimulation than previously published fast variants. Furthermore, we identified a combinatorial mutation with extraordinary dynamic range, eGCaMP2+, that outperforms the tested 6th, 7th, and 8th generation GCaMPs. These findings demonstrate the value of machine learning as a tool to facilitate the efficient pre-screening of mutants for functional characteristics. By leveraging the learning capabilities of our ensemble, we were able to accelerate the identification of promising mutations and reduce the experimental burden associated with trial-and-error mutagenesis.

Taking advantage of the calcium response that is a hallmark of sperm-egg fusion, we adapted the genetically encoded calcium indicator jGCaMP7s to visualize the moment of fertilization in Caenorhabditis elegans using fluorescence. We termed this tool the 'CaFE' reporter, for 'calcium during fertilization in C. elegans'. The CaFE reporter produced a robust signal that recapitulated the previously reported, biphasic nature of the calcium wave and had no significant deleterious effects on worm physiology or fecundity. Calcium waves were not observed at the restrictive temperature in the spe-9(hc88) strain, in which sperm can still trigger meiotic maturation but can no longer fuse with the oocyte. Demonstrating the utility of the CaFE reporter, we analyzed polyspermy induced by inhibition of egg-3 via RNAi and observed late calcium waves in the uterus. This finding provides support to the idea that calcium release is not restricted to the first sperm fusion event during polyspermy. Establishment of the CaFE reporter in the genetically tractable and optically transparent worm provides a powerful tool to dissect the oocyte-to-embryo transition inside a living animal.",

        "abstract": "Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is an abundantly expressed peptide in the nervous system. Its widespread distribution along with its receptors, both centrally and peripherally, indicates its broad functions in numerous biological processes. However, the low endogenous concentration and diffuse distribution of NPY make it challenging to study its actions and dynamics directly and comprehensively. Studies on the role of NPY have primarily been limited to exogenous application, transgene expression, or knock-out in biological systems, which are often combined with pharmacological probes to delineate the involvement of specific NPY receptors. Therefore, to better understand the function of NPY in time and space, direct visualization of the real-time dynamics of endogenous NPY is a valuable and desired tool. Using the first-generation and newly developed intensiometric green fluorescent G-protein-coupled NPY sensor (GRAB NPY1.0), we, for the first time, demonstrate and characterize the direct detection of endogenously released NPY in cultured cortical neurons. A dose-dependent fluorescent signal was observed upon exogenous NPY application in nearly all recorded neurons. Pharmacologically evoked neuronal activity induced a significant increase in fluorescent signal in 32% of neurons, reflecting the release of NPY, despite only 3% of all neurons containing NPY. The remaining pool of neurons expressing the sensor were either non-responsive or displayed a notable decline in the fluorescent signal. Such decline in fluorescent signal was not rescued in cortical cultures transduced with an NPY overexpression vector, where 88% of the neurons were NPY-positive. Overexpression of NPY did, however, result in sensor signals that were more readily distinguishable. This may suggest that biological factors, such as subtle changes in intracellular pH, could interfere with the fluorescent signal, and thereby underestimate the release of endogenous NPY when using this new sensor in its present configuration. However, the development of next-generation NPY GRAB sensor technology is expected soon, and will eventually enable much-wanted studies on endogenous NPY release dynamics in both cultured and intact biological systems.",

        "abstract": "The dynamics of phosphatidylserine in the plasma membrane is a tightly regulated feature of eukaryotic cells. Phosphatidylserine (PS) is found preferentially in the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane. Disruption of this asymmetry leads to the exposure of phosphatidylserine on the cell surface and is associated with cell death, synaptic pruning, blood clotting and other cellular processes. Due to the role of phosphatidylserine in widespread cellular functions, an efficient phosphatidylserine probe is needed to study them. Currently, a few different phosphatidylserine labelling tools are available; however, these labels have unfavourable signal-to-noise ratios and are difficult to use in tissues due to limited permeability. Their application in living tissue requires injection procedures that damage the tissue and release damage-associated molecular patterns, which in turn stimulates phosphatidylserine exposure. For this reason, we developed a novel genetically encoded phosphatidylserine probe based on the C2 domain of the lactadherin (MFG-E8) protein, suitable for labelling exposed phosphatidylserine in various research models. We tested the C2 probe specificity to phosphatidylserine on hybrid bilayer lipid membranes by observing surface plasmon resonance angle shift. Then, we analysed purified fused C2 proteins on different cell culture lines or engineered AAVs encoding C2 probes on tissue cultures after apoptosis induction. For in vivo experiments, neurotropic AAVs were intravenously injected into perinatal mice, and after 2 weeks, brain slices were collected to observe C2-SNAP expression. The biophysical analysis revealed the high specificity of the C2 probe for phosphatidylserine. The fused recombinant C2 proteins were suitable for labelling phosphatidylserine on the surface of apoptotic cells in various cell lines. We engineered AAVs and validated them in organotypic brain tissue cultures for non-invasive delivery of the genetically encoded C2 probe and showed that these probes were expressed in the brain in vivo after intravenous AAV delivery to mice. We have demonstrated that the developed genetically encoded PS biosensor can be utilised in a variety of assays as a two-component system of C2 and C2m2 fusion proteins. This system allows for precise quantification and PS visualisation at directly specified threshold levels, enabling the evaluation of PS exposure in both physiological and cell death processes.",

Although conventional fluorescent protein-based sensors have been designed, RNA-based sensors are promising imaging tools. Numerous RNA-based sensors have been developed.

With Pepper, we engineered various sensors for metabolites, synthetic compounds, proteins and metal ions in vitro and in living cells. In addition, these sensors show high activation and selectivity, demonstrating their universality and robustness. In the case of sensors responding to S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), a metabolite produced by methionine adenosyltransferase (MATase), we showed that our sensors exhibited positively correlated fluorescence responding to different SAM levels. Importantly, we revealed the SAM biosynthesis pathway and monitored MATase activity and gene expression spatiotemporally in living individual human cells. Additionally, we constructed a ratiometric SAM sensor to determine the inhibition efficacy of a MATase inhibitor in living cells. Together, these sensors comprising Pepper provide a useful platform for imaging diverse cellular targets and their signaling pathway.",

However, it remains a significant challenge to gain specificity. Here, we present a genetically encoded boronolectin which is a hybrid protein consisting of a noncanonical amino acid (ncAA) <i>p</i>-boronophenylalanine (<i>p</i>BoF), natural-lectin-derived peptide sequences, and a circularly permuted red fluorescent protein (cpRFP). The genetic encodability permitted a straightforward protein engineering process to derive a red fluorescent biosensor that can specifically bind uridine diphosphate <i>N</i>-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc), an important nucleotide sugar involved in metabolic sensing and cell signaling.

In addition, we combined bapaUGAc with UGAcS, a recently reported green fluorescent UDP-GlcNAc sensor based on an alternative sensing mechanism, to monitor UDP-GlcNAc level changes in the ER and cytosol simultaneously.

Two of the resulting GEVIs, ASAP4b and ASAP4e, respond to 100-mV depolarizations with ≥180% fluorescence increases, compared with the 50% fluorescence decrease of the parental ASAP3. With standard microscopy equipment, ASAP4e enables single-trial detection of spikes in mice over the course of minutes. Unlike GEVIs previously used for one-photon voltage recordings, ASAP4b and ASAP4e also perform well under two-photon illumination. By imaging voltage and calcium simultaneously, we show that ASAP4b and ASAP4e can identify place cells and detect voltage spikes with better temporal resolution than commonly used calcium indicators.

In addition, picosecond dynamics of intermolecular energy transfer in fluorescent proteins has been observed. Here, we present the development of a genetically encoded fluorescent sensor that can detect changes in hydrophobicity by monitoring ultrafast fluorescence depolarisation. Our sensor is composed of a pair of dimeric enhanced green fluorescent proteins (dEGFPs) linked by a flexible amino-acid linker. We show dimerisation is perturbed by the addition of glycerol which interferes with the hydrophobic interaction of the two proteins. Time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy revealed a systematic attenuation of ultrafast fluorescence depolarisation when the sensor was exposed to increasing glycerol concentrations. This suggests that as hydrophobicity increases, dEGFP pairing decreases within a tandem dimer. Un-pairing of the protein fluorophores dramatically alters the rate of energy transfer between the proteins, resulting in an increase in the limiting anisotropy of the sensor.",

Our work reveals temporal dynamics of FAK activity during FA turnover. Most importantly, our study unveils polarized FAK activity at the distal tip of newly formed single FAs in the leading edge of a migrating cell. By combining FAK-SPARK with DNA tension probes, we show that tensions applied to FAs precede FAK activation and that FAK activity is proportional to the strength of tension.

Despite its importance, the neuromodulatory transmission in most tissues and organs remains poorly understood due to the limitations of current tools for direct measurement of neuromodulatory transmitters. In order to study the functional roles of neuromodulatory transmitters in animal behaviors and brain disorders, new fluorescent sensors based on bacterial periplasmic binding proteins (PBPs) and G-protein coupled receptors have been developed, but their results have not been compared to or multiplexed with traditional methods such as electrophysiological recordings. In this study, a multiplexed method was developed to measure acetylcholine (ACh), norepinephrine (NE), and serotonin (5-HT) in cultured rat hippocampal slices using simultaneous whole-cell patch clamp recordings and genetically encoded fluorescence sensor imaging. The strengths and weaknesses of each technique were compared, and the results showed that both techniques did not interfere with each other. In general, genetically encoded sensors GRAB<sub><i>NE</i></sub> and GRAB<sub>5<i>HT</i>1</sub>.<sub>0</sub> showed better stability compared to electrophysiological recordings in detecting NE and 5-HT, while electrophysiological recordings had faster temporal kinetics in reporting ACh.

In sum, this study demonstrates the use of combined techniques to measure neurotransmitter dynamics and highlights the potential for future multianalyte monitoring.",

Successful application of GCaMP biosensors to a wide range of biological questions requires that sensor properties such as brightness and dynamic range, ligand affinity and response kinetics be tuned to the specific conditions or phenomena to be investigated. Random as well as rational targeted mutations of such sensor molecules have led to a number of important breakthroughs in this field, including the calcium sensors GCaMP6f and GCaMP6f<i><sub><i>u</i></sub></i>. jGCaMP8f of the most recently developed generation is promising a step-change in <i>in vivo</i> imaging with further increased fluorescence dynamic range.

Despite substantial advances in the field of neurotoxicology, there remain significant knowledge gaps in our understanding of cellular targets and molecular mechanisms that mediate the neurotoxicological endpoints associated with exposure to both legacy contaminants and emerging contaminants of concern. Zebrafish are a powerful neurotoxicological model given their high degree sequence conservation with humans and the similarities they share with mammals in micro- and macro-level brain structures. Many zebrafish studies have effectively utilized behavioral assays to predict the neurotoxic potential of different compounds, but behavioral phenotypes are rarely able to predict the brain structures, cell types, or mechanisms affected by chemical exposures. Calcium-modulated photoactivatable ratiometric integrator (CaMPARI), a recently developed genetically-encoded calcium indicator, undergoes a permanent green to red switch in the presence of elevated intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations and 405-nm light, which allows for a \"snapshot\" of brain activity in freely-swimming larvae. To determine whether behavioral results are predictive of patterns of neuronal activity, we assessed the effects of three common neurotoxicants, ethanol, 2,2',3,5',6-pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB 95), and monoethylhexyl phthalate (MEHP), on both brain activity and behavior by combining the behavioral light/dark assay with CaMPARI imaging. We demonstrate that brain activity profiles and behavioral phenotypes are not always concordant and, therefore, behavior alone is not sufficient to understand how toxicant exposure affects neural development and network dynamics. We conclude that pairing behavioral assays with functional neuroimaging tools such as CaMPARI provides a more comprehensive understanding of the neurotoxic endpoints of compounds while still offering a relatively high throughput approach to toxicity testing.",

A new dimension in protein imaging can be offered by combining protein tags with polarity-sensitive fluorescent probes, which provide information about local nanoscale environments of target proteins within the subcellular compartments (organelles). Here, we designed three fluorescent probes based on solvatochromic nile red dye, conjugated to a HaloTag reactive targeting group through polyethylene glycol linkers of varying lengths. The probe with medium linker length, NR12-Halo, was found to label specifically a large variety of proteins localized in defined cell compartments, such as plasma membranes (outer and inner leaflets), endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, cytosol, microtubules, actin, and chromatin. Owing to its polarity-sensitive fluorophore, the probe clearly distinguished the proteins localized within apolar lipid membranes from other proteins. Moreover, it revealed dramatic changes in the environment during the life cycle of proteins from biosynthesis to their expected localization and, finally, to recycling inside lysosomes. Heterogeneity in the local polarity of some membrane proteins also suggested a formation of low-polar protein aggregates, for example, within cell-cell contacts. The approach also showed that mechanical stress (cell shrinking by osmotic shock) induced a general polarity decrease in membrane proteins, probably due to the condensation of biomolecules. Finally, the nanoenvironment of some membrane proteins was affected by a polyunsaturated fatty acid diet, which provided the bridge between organization of lipids and proteins. The developed solvatochromic HaloTag probe constitutes a promising tool for probing nanoscale environments of proteins and their interactions within subcellular structures.",

As a proof-of-concept, we have identified in this study five <i>in vitro</i> orthogonal fluorogenic RNA aptamer/dye pairs (>10-fold higher fluorescence signals), four of which can be used for highly orthogonal and multiplexed imaging in living bacterial and mammalian cells. After further optimizing the cellular fluorescence activation and deactivation kinetics of these RNA/dye pairs, the whole four-color semi-quantitative seqFRIES process can now be completed in ~20 min. Meanwhile, seqFRIES-mediated simultaneous detection of two critical signaling molecules, guanosine tetraphosphate and cyclic diguanylate, was also achieved within individual living cells. We expect our validation of this new seqFRIES concept here will facilitate the further development and potential broad usage of these orthogonal fluorogenic RNA/dye pairs for highly multiplexed and dynamic cellular imaging and cell biology studies.",

Here we establish a novel genetically encoded voltage indicator candidate based on the recently discovered subfamily of the microbial rhodopsin clade, termed heliorhodopsins. We discovered that upon excitation at 530 to 560 nm, wildtype heliorhodopsin exhibits near-infrared fluorescence, which is sensitive to membrane voltage. We characterized the fluorescence brightness, photostability, voltage sensitivity, and kinetics of wildtype heliorhodopsin in HEK293T cells and further examined the impact of mutating key residues near the retinal chromophore. The S237A mutation significantly improved the fluorescence response of heliorhodopsin by 76% providing a highly promising starting point for further protein evolution.",

        "abstract": "Among the biologically relevant reactive oxygen species (ROS), hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) has special properties. H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> can diffuse across membranes, has a low reactivity, and is very stable. Deprotonated cysteine residues in proteins can be oxidized by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> into a highly reactive sulfenic acid derivative (-SOH), which can react with another cysteine to form a disulfide. Under higher oxidative stress the sulfenic acid undergo further oxidation to sulfinic acid (Cys-SO<sub>2</sub>H), which can subsequently be reduced. The sulfinic acid can be hyperoxidized to sulfonic acid (Cys-SO<sub>3</sub>H), whose reduction is irreversible. Formation of sulfenic acids can have a role in sensing oxidative stress, signal transduction, modulating localization and activity to regulate protein functions. Therefore, there is an emerging interest in trying to understand the pool of proteins that result in these sorts of modification in response to oxidative stress. This is known as the sulfenome and several approaches have been developed in animal and plant cells to analyze the sulfenome under different stress responses. These approaches can be proteomic, molecular, immunological (i.e., antibodies), or expressing genetically encoded probes that specifically react to sulfenic modifications. In this chapter, we describe an additional approach that allows visualization of sulfenic modification in vivo. This is newly developed fluorescent probe DCP-Rho1 can be implemented in any plant cell to analyze the sulfenic modification.",

Under pathophysiological conditions, disturbances in these pools have been linked to altered intracellular communication and cellular dysfunction. To facilitate studies of subcellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in beta cells and, particularly, signaling between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria, we designed a novel dual Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor which we termed DS-1. DS-1 encodes two stoichiometrically fluorescent proteins within a single plasmid, G-CEPIA-er, targeted to the ER and R-CEPIA3-mt, targeted to mitochondria. Our goal was to simultaneously measure the ER and mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> in cells in real time. The <i>K<sub>ds</sub></i> of G-CEPIA-er and R-CEPIA3-mt for Ca<sup>2+</sup> are 672 and 3.7 μM, respectively. Confocal imaging of insulin-secreting INS-1 832/13 expressing DS-1 confirmed that the green and red fluorophores correctly colocalized with organelle-specific fluorescent markers as predicted. Further, we tested whether DS-1 exhibited the functional properties expected by challenging an INS-1 cell to glucose concentrations or drugs having well-documented effects on the ER and mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling. The data obtained were consistent with those seen using other single organelle targeted probes. These results taken together suggest that DS-1 is a promising new approach for investigating Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling within multiple organelles of the cell.",

Still, the exact mechanism governing magnesium transport by this protein complex is not well understood. Herein, we have developed a genetically encoded intracellular magnesium-specific reporter and demonstrate that the CNNM family inhibits the function of the TRPM7 magnesium channel. We show that the small GTPase ARL15 increases CNNM3/TRPM7 protein complex formation to reduce TRPM7 activity. Conversely, PRL-2 overexpression counteracts ARL15 binding to CNNM3 and enhances the function of TRPM7 by preventing the interaction between CNNM3 and TRPM7. Moreover, while TRPM7-induced cell signaling is promoted by PRL-1/2, it is reduced when CNNM3 is overexpressed. Lowering cellular magnesium levels reduces the interaction of CNNM3 with TRPM7 in a PRL-dependent manner, whereby knockdown of PRL-1/2 restores the protein complex formation. Cotargeting of TRPM7 and PRL-1/2 alters mitochondrial function and sensitizes cells to metabolic stress induced by magnesium depletion. These findings reveal the dynamic regulation of TRPM7 function in response to PRL-1/2 levels, to coordinate magnesium transport and reprogram cellular metabolism.",

        "abstract": "Exosomes contain a plethora of unique disease biomarkers involving cellular homeostasis, infection dissemination, cancer development, and cardiac diseases. Exosomes originating from cancer cells have promising biomarkers for the early detection and assessment of the therapeutic response to cancer. The exosomal epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a potential biomarker which is overexpressed in cancer; thus, the level of EGFR expression is investigated by so many methods in a liquid and solid biopsy. The optimal method for isolating pure exosomal EGFRs has not been well understood so far. Current approaches are complicated and time-consuming, therefore hampering their clinical applications. Here, we demonstrate the creation of an innovative fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) sensor, named ExoSen (exosome sensor), which can be implemented to determine the concentration of exosomal EGFRs at in vitro as well as in vivo levels. In this study, a sensing element for A549 exosomes, mitogen-inducible gene 6 (MIG6), has been employed between the FRET pair ECFP and Venus. MIG6 binding to ExoSen induced a conformational change that can be monitored by a variation in the FRET ratio. Moreover, the developed sensor, expressed in bacterial, yeast, and HEK-293T cells, demonstrates an increased FRET ratio with the addition of A549 exosomes, which can quantify the A549 exosomes noninvasively. The ExoSen enables rapid detection of A549 exosomes with great sensitivity at a concentration of 3.5 × 10<sup>9</sup> particles/mL. ExoSen is stable to pH fluctuations and provides a highly accurate, real-time optical readout in cell-based experiments by using confocal microscopy.",

A H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-low (HyPerion-low) subset of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells was enriched with leukemia-initiating cells, which were endowed with high colony-forming ability, potent drug resistance, endosteal rather than vascular localization, and short survival.

Unfortunately, many HSCR patients have persistent dysmotility (e.g., constipation, incontinence) and enterocolitis after surgery, suggesting that the remaining bowel is not normal despite having ENS ganglia. Anatomical and neurochemical alterations have been observed in the ENS-innervated proximal bowel from HSCR patients and mice, but no studies have recorded ENS activity to define the circuit mechanisms underlying post-surgical HSCR dysfunction. Here, we generated a HSCR mouse model with a genetically-encoded calcium indicator to map the ENS connectome in the proximal colon. We identified abnormal spontaneous and synaptic ENS activity in proximal colons from GCaMP-Ednrb <sup>-/-</sup> mice with HSCR that corresponded to motor dysfunction. Many HSCR-associated defects were also observed in GCaMP-Ednrb <sup>+/-</sup> mice, despite complete ENS innervation. Results suggest that functional abnormalities in the ENS-innervated bowel contribute to post-surgical bowel complications in HSCR patients, and HSCR-related mutations that do not cause aganglionosis may cause chronic colon dysfunction in patients without a HSCR diagnosis.",

The genetically encoded sensor rapidly detects intracellular LC-acyl-CoAs generated from exogenous and endogenous fatty acids (FAs), as well as synthetic ABHD5 ligands. Stimulation of lipolysis in brown adipocytes elevated intracellular LC-acyl-CoAs in a cyclic fashion, which was eliminated by inhibiting PNPLA2 (ATGL), the major triglyceride lipase.

The genetic encodability permitted a straightforward protein engineering process to derive a red fluorescent biosensor that can specifically bind uridine diphosphate N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc), an important nucleotide sugar involved in metabolic sensing and cell signaling. We further characterized the resultant boronic acid-and peptide-assisted UDP-GlcNAc sensor (bapaUGAc) both in vitro and in live mammalian cells.

        "abstract": "Adenosine 5' triphosphate (ATP) is the energy currency of life, which is produced in mitochondria (~90%) and cytosol (less than 10%). Real-time effects of metabolic changes on cellular ATP dynamics remain indeterminate. Here we report the design and validation of a genetically encoded fluorescent ATP indicator that allows for real-time, simultaneous visualization of cytosolic and mitochondrial ATP in cultured cells. This dual-ATP indicator, called smacATPi (simultaneous mitochondrial and cytosolic ATP indicator), combines previously described individual cytosolic and mitochondrial ATP indicators. The use of smacATPi can help answer biological questions regarding ATP contents and dynamics in living cells. As expected, 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG, a glycolytic inhibitor) led to substantially decreased cytosolic ATP, and oligomycin (a complex V inhibitor) markedly decreased mitochondrial ATP in cultured HEK293T cells transfected with smacATPi. With the use of smacATPi, we can also observe that 2-DG treatment modestly attenuates mitochondrial ATP and oligomycin reduces cytosolic ATP, indicating the subsequent changes of compartmental ATP. To evaluate the role of ATP/ADP carrier (AAC) in ATP trafficking, we treated HEK293T cells with an AAC inhibitor, Atractyloside (ATR). ATR treatment attenuated cytosolic and mitochondrial ATP in normoxia, suggesting AAC inhibition reduces ADP import from the cytosol to mitochondria and ATP export from mitochondria to cytosol. In HEK293T cells subjected to hypoxia, ATR treatment increased mitochondrial ATP along with decreased cytosolic ATP, implicating that ACC inhibition during hypoxia sustains mitochondrial ATP but may not inhibit the reversed ATP import from the cytosol. Furthermore, both mitochondrial and cytosolic signals decrease when ATR is given in conjunction with 2-DG in hypoxia. Thus, real-time visualization of spatiotemporal ATP dynamics using smacATPi provides novel insights into how cytosolic and mitochondrial ATP signals respond to metabolic changes, providing a better understanding of cellular metabolism in health and disease.",

Here, we developed the first pan-neuronal genetic driver in a Hymenopteran model organism, the honey bee, and expressed the calcium indicator GCaMP6f under the control of the honey bee synapsin promoter. We show that GCaMP6f is widely expressed in the honey bee brain, allowing to record neural activity from multiple brain regions. To assess the power of this tool, we focused on the olfactory system, recording simultaneous responses from the antennal lobe, and from the more poorly investigated lateral horn (LH) and mushroom body (MB) calyces. Neural responses to 16 distinct odorants demonstrate that odorant quality (chemical structure) and quantity are faithfully encoded in the honey bee antennal lobe. In contrast, odor coding in the LH departs from this simple physico-chemical coding, supporting the role of this structure in coding the biological value of odorants. We further demonstrate robust neural responses to several bee pheromone odorants, key drivers of social behavior, in the LH. Combined, these brain recordings represent the first use of a neurogenetic tool for recording large-scale neural activity in a eusocial insect and will be of utility in assessing the neural underpinnings of olfactory and other sensory modalities and of social behaviors and cognitive abilities.",

Monitoring and silencing peptidergic and glutamatergic transmissions from presynaptic terminals using our newly developed tools and existing genetic tools, respectively, reveal that neuropeptides, not glutamate, are the primary transmitter in encoding unconditioned stimulus during Pavlovian threat learning.

        "abstract": "Glutathione (GSH), the constituent of the redox buffer system, is a scavenger of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and its ratio to oxidized glutathione (GSSG) is a key indicator of oxidative stress in the cell. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a highly aggressive hematopoietic malignancy characterized by aberrant levels of reduced and oxidized GSH due to oxidative stress. Therefore, the real-time, dynamic, and highly sensitive detection of GSH/GSSG in AML cells is of great interest for the clinical diagnosis and treatment of leukemia. The application of genetically encoded sensors to monitor GSH/GSSG levels in AML cells is not explored, and the underlying mechanism of how the drugs affect GSH/GSSG dynamics remains unclear. In this study, we developed subcellular compartment-specific sensors to monitor GSH/GSSG combined with high-resolution fluorescence microscopy that provides insights into basal GSH/GSSG levels in the cytosol, mitochondria, nucleus, and endoplasmic reticulum of AML cells, in a decreasing order, revealing substantial heterogeneity of GSH/GSSG level dynamics in different subcellular compartments. Further, we investigated the response of GSH/GSSG ratio in AML cells caused by Prussian blue and Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> nanoparticles, separately and in combination with cytarabine, pointing to steep gradients. Moreover, cytarabine and doxorubicin downregulated the GSH/GSSG levels in different subcellular compartments. Similarly, live-cell imaging showed a compartment-specific decrease in response to various drugs, such as CB-839, parthenolide (PTL), and piperlongumine (PLM). The enzymatic activity assay revealed the mechanism underlying fluctuations in GSH/GSSG levels in different subcellular compartments mediated by these drugs in the GSH metabolic pathway, suggesting some potential therapeutic targets in AML cells.",

Since then, investigation of calcium dynamics in liver explants and culture has greatly increased our understanding of calcium signaling. A bottleneck, however, exists in observing calcium dynamics in a noninvasive manner because of the optical inaccessibility of the mammalian liver. Here, we aimed to take advantage of the transparency of the zebrafish larvae to image hepatocyte calcium dynamics in vivo at cellular resolution. We developed a transgenic model expressing a calcium sensor, GCaMP6s, specifically in zebrafish hepatocytes. Using this, we provide a quantitative assessment of intracellular calcium dynamics during multiple contexts, including growth, feeding, ethanol-induced stress, and cell ablation. Specifically, we show that synchronized calcium oscillations are present in vivo , which are lost upon starvation. Starvation induces lipid accumulation in the liver. Feeding recommences calcium waves in the liver, but in a spatially restricted manner, as well as resolves starvation-induced hepatic steatosis. By using a genetically encoded scavenger for calcium, we show that dampening of calcium signaling accelerates the accumulation of starvation-related lipid droplets in the liver. Furthermore, ethanol treatment, as well as cell ablation, induces calcium flux, but with different dynamics. The former causes asynchronous calcium oscillations, whereas the latter leads to a single calcium spike. We demonstrate the presence of oscillations, waves, and spikes in vivo . Calcium waves are present in response to nutrition and negatively regulate starvation-induced accumulation of lipid droplets.",

This unique property was previously used to label neurons based upon their tuning properties in order to map synaptic connectivity and to record large-scale neuronal activity in freely moving mice without attaching any mechanical device to them. The latest version of CaMPARI (CaMPARI2) was engineered to enhance the contrast generated by photoconverting the green protein to the activity-dependent red form and to reduce the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent photoconversion rate compared to the first generation of CaMPARI (CaMPARI1). However, here we show that this optimization process also resulted in reduced photoconversion efficiency of active neurons in the mouse cortex and hippocampus. Through side-by-side comparison of the two CaMPARI sensors under several experimental conditions, we show that CaMPARI1 exhibits a substantially higher red-to-green ratio in active cells than CaMPARI2. In addition, we show that CaMPARI1 also functions as a more sensitive traditional Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor than CaMPARI2 by producing larger activity-driven dynamic fluorescence changes in the observed neurons. Therefore, we conclude that during the optimization process of CaMPARI2, some of the sensor's characteristics were not predicted properly by <i>in vitro</i> screening assays, and therefore <i>in vivo</i> screening and validation steps should be included in future optimization attempts to increase the predictability of screening pipelines.",

Our prior work suggested that TRPC1 forms Ca<sup>2+</sup> leak channels located in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) membrane. Prior studies suggested that TRPC1 channels in the cell membrane are mechanosensitive, but this was not yet investigated in cardiomyocytes or for SR localized TRPC1 channels.

Sensor variants with different affinities for serotonin were engineered to increase the versatility in imaging of serotonin dynamics. Experiments in vitro and in vivo showed the feasibility of imaging serotonin dynamics with high temporal and spatial resolution.

However, the structural complexity, need for sophisticated equipment, and relatively small fluorescent change limit the use of FRET indicators for subcellular targeting and development of high-throughput screening methodologies. Using the bacterial periplasmic binding protein TTHA0766 from <i>Thermus thermophilus</i>, we have now developed a single-fluorophore indicator for lactate, CanlonicSF. This indicator exhibits a maximal fluorescence change of 200% and a <i>K</i><sub>D</sub> of ∼300 μM. The fluorescence is not affected by other monocarboxylates. The lactate indicator was not significantly affected by Ca<sup>2+</sup> at the physiological concentrations prevailing in the cytosol, endoplasmic reticulum, and extracellular space, but was affected by Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the low micromolar range. Targeting the indicator to the endoplasmic reticulum revealed for the first time sub-cellular lactate dynamics. Its improved lactate-induced fluorescence response permitted the development of a multiwell plate assay to screen for inhibitors of the monocarboxylate transporters MCTs, a pharmaceutical target for cancer and inflammation. The functionality of the indicator in living tissue was demonstrated in the brain of <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> larvae. CanlonicSF is well suited to explore lactate dynamics with sub-cellular resolution in intact systems.",

Imaging of cAMPFIREs in awake mice reveals tonic levels of cAMP in cortical neurons that are associated with wakefulness, modulated by opioids, and differentially regulated across subcellular compartments.

A FbFP derived from <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> (CreiLOV) is a promising platform for designing new metal sensors. Some FbFPs are intrinsically quenched by metal ions, but the question of where metals bind and how to tune metal affinity has not been addressed. We used site-directed mutagenesis of CreiLOV to probe a hypothesized copper(II) binding site that led to fluorescence quenching. Most mutations changed the fluorescence quenching level, supporting the proposed site. One key mutation introducing a second cysteine residue in place of asparagine (CreiLOV<sub>N41C</sub>) significantly altered metal affinity and selectivity, yielding a zinc sensor. The fluorescence intensity and lifetime of CreiLOV<sub>N41C</sub> were reversibly quenched by Zn<sup>2+</sup> ions with a biologically relevant affinity (apparent dissociation constant, <i>K</i><sub>d</sub>, of 1 nM). Copper quenching of CreiLOV<sub>N41C</sub> was retained but with several orders of magnitude higher affinity than CreiLOV (<i>K</i><sub>d</sub> = 0.066 fM for Cu<sup>2+</sup>, 5.4 fM for Cu<sup>+</sup>) and partial reversibility. We also show that CreiLOV<sub>N41C</sub> is an excellent intensity- and lifetime-based zinc sensor in aerobic and anaerobic live bacterial cells. Zn<sup>2+</sup>-induced fluorescence quenching is reversible over several cycles in <i>Escherichia coli</i> cell suspensions and can be imaged by fluorescence microscopy.

        "abstract": "Heme is both an essential cofactor and an abundant source of nutritional iron for the human pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis. While heme is required for M. tuberculosis survival and virulence, it is also potentially cytotoxic. Since M. tuberculosis can both synthesize and take up heme, the <i>de novo</i> synthesis of heme and its acquisition from the host may need to be coordinated in order to mitigate heme toxicity. However, the mechanisms employed by M. tuberculosis to regulate heme uptake, synthesis, and bioavailability are poorly understood. By integrating ratiometric heme sensors with mycobacterial genetics, cell biology, and biochemistry, we determined that <i>de novo</i>-synthesized heme is more bioavailable than exogenously scavenged heme, and heme availability signals the downregulation of heme biosynthetic enzyme gene expression. Ablation of heme synthesis does not result in the upregulation of known heme import proteins. Moreover, we found that <i>de novo</i> heme synthesis is critical for survival from macrophage assault. Altogether, our data suggest that mycobacteria utilize heme from endogenous and exogenous sources differently and that targeting heme synthesis may be an effective therapeutic strategy to treat mycobacterial infections. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Mycobacterium tuberculosis infects ~25% of the world's population and causes tuberculosis (TB), the second leading cause of death from infectious disease. Heme is an essential metabolite for M. tuberculosis, and targeting the unique heme biosynthetic pathway of M. tuberculosis could serve as an effective therapeutic strategy. However, since M. tuberculosis can both synthesize and scavenge heme, it was unclear if inhibiting heme synthesis alone could serve as a viable approach to suppress M. tuberculosis growth and virulence. The importance of this work lies in the development and application of genetically encoded fluorescent heme sensors to probe bioavailable heme in M. tuberculosis and the discovery that endogenously synthesized heme is more bioavailable than exogenously scavenged heme. Moreover, it was found that heme synthesis protected M. tuberculosis from macrophage killing, and bioavailable heme in M. tuberculosis is diminished during macrophage infection. Altogether, these findings suggest that targeting M. tuberculosis heme synthesis is an effective approach to combat M. tuberculosis infections.",

Our results show that the GVs-miRFP680 MG1655 bacteria can effectively integrate the advantages of low tissue absorbance from near-infrared fluorescent proteins and non-invasiveness from gas vesicles. We successfully developed GVs-miRFP680 MG1655 bacteria, which have both acoustic and optical imaging abilities in vitro and in vivo.

Creation of transcription factor-based biosensors in a clinically-relevant strain often requires significant tuning of the genetic parts and gene expression to achieve the dynamic range and sensitivity required. Here, we propose an approach to efficiently engineer transcription-factor based metabolite biosensors that uses a design prototyping construct to quickly assay the gene expression design space and identify an optimal genetic design. We demonstrate this approach using the probiotic bacterium <i>Escherichia coli</i> Nissle 1917 (EcN) and two neuroactive gut metabolites: the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and the short-chain fatty acid propionate. The EcN propionate sensor, utilizing the PrpR transcriptional activator from <i>E. coli</i>, has a large 59-fold dynamic range and >500-fold increased sensitivity that matches biologically-relevant concentrations<i>.</i> Our EcN GABA biosensor uses the GabR transcriptional repressor from <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> and a synthetic GabR-regulated promoter created in this study.

Compared to apoptosis, necrosis is a nonspecific form of sudden cell death in response to an invasive external stimulus which in turn is devoid of active programmed intracellular signaling leading to the sudden release of the soluble cellular contents consequent to the rupture of the cell membrane. This fundamental difference between apoptosis and necrosis made us believe that the former is the safe form of cell death and the latter is an undesirable one which often elicits an inflammatory response to the adjacent cells. Recent studies have shown that necrosis also involves a few defined cellular and complex biochemical events similar to apoptosis rendering it difficult to distinguish these two events at the single-cell level using the currently used popular assays.Here we provide a newly described detailed methodology encompassing cell system development along with a multiparametric flow cytometry-based approach to discriminate apoptotic cells from necrotic cells using a stable cell line expressing genetically encoded probe for detecting caspase activation and DsRed targeted at the mitochondria.",

In addition, synthetic engineering of BiFC probes which can be readily used for multiplexing imaging is also highly valuable for uncovering more or new layers of information on PPIs. In this report, we developed a bright stable green fluorescent protein Springgreen-M based on our previously evolved fast reversible photoswitching fluorescent protein (RSFP) GMars-T.

A somewhat generalizable approach for this challenge is demonstrated here by evolving a naturally occurring chemically induced heterodimer into a genetically encoded sensor for herbicides. The interaction between PYRABACTIN-RESISTANT-like receptors and type-2C protein phosphatases is induced by abscisic acid─a small-molecule hormone in plants. We considered abscisic acid receptors as a potential scaffold for the development of biosensors because of past successes in their engineering, a structurally defined ligand cavity and the availability of large-scale assays for their activation. A panel of 475 receptor variants, mutated at ligand-proximal residues, was screened for activation by 37 herbicides from several classes. Twelve compounds activated at least one member of the mutant panel. To facilitate the subsequent improvement of herbicide receptors through directed evolution, we engineered a yeast two-hybrid platform optimized for sequential positive and negative selection using fluorescence-activated cell sorting. By utilizing this system, we were able to isolate receptors with low nanomolar sensitivity and a broad dynamic range in sensing a ubiquitous group of chloroacetamide herbicides.

        "abstract": "Fluorescent Correlation Spectroscopy (FCS) allows us to determine interactions of labeled proteins or changes in the oligomeric state. The FCS method needs a low amount of fluorescent dye, near nanomolar concentrations. To control the amount of fluorescent dye, we used new photoconvertible FP SAASoti. This work is devoted to the proof of principle of using photoconvertible proteins to measure caspase enzymatic activity in a single live cell. The advantage of this approach is that partial photoconversion of the FP makes FCS measurements possible when studying enzymatic reactions. To investigate the process, in vivo we used HeLa cell line expressing the engineered FRET sensor, SAASoti-23-KFP. This FRET sensor has a cleavable (DEVD) sequence in the linker between two FPs for the detection of one of the key enzymes of apoptosis, caspase-3. Caspase-3 activity was detected by registering the increase in the fluorescent lifetimes of the sensor, whereas the diffusion coefficient of SAASoti decreased. This can be explained by an increase in the total cell viscosity during apoptosis. We can suppose that in the moment of detectible caspase-3 activity, cell structure already has crucial changes in viscosity.",

        "abstract": "In the SARS-CoV-2 lifecycle, papain-like protease PLpro cuts off the non-structural proteins nsp1, nsp2, and nsp3 from a large polyprotein. This is the earliest viral enzymatic activity, which is crucial for all downstream steps. Here, we designed two genetically encoded fluorescent sensors for the real-time detection of PLpro activity in live cells. The first sensor was based on the Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) between the red fluorescent protein mScarlet as a donor and the biliverdin-binding near-infrared fluorescent protein miRFP670 as an acceptor. A linker with the PLpro recognition site LKGG in between made this FRET pair sensitive to PLpro cleavage. Upon the co-expression of mScarlet-LKGG-miRFP670 and PLpro in HeLa cells, we observed a gradual increase in the donor fluorescence intensity of about 1.5-fold. In the second sensor, both PLpro and its target-green mNeonGreen and red mScarletI fluorescent proteins separated by an LKGG-containing linker-were attached to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. Upon cleavage by PLpro, mScarletI diffused from the ER throughout the cell. About a two-fold increase in the nucleus/cytoplasm ratio was observed as a result of the PLpro action. We believe that the new PLpro sensors can potentially be used to detect the earliest stages of SARS-CoV-2 propagation in live cells as well as for the screening of PLpro inhibitors.",

        "abstract": "Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) is a canonical intracellular messenger playing diverse roles in cell functions. In neurons, cAMP promotes axonal growth during early development, and mediates sensory transduction and synaptic plasticity after maturation. The molecular cascades of cAMP are well documented, but its spatiotemporal profiles associated with neuronal functions remain hidden. Hence, we developed a genetically encoded cAMP indicator based on a bacterial cAMP-binding protein. This indicator \"gCarvi\" monitors [cAMP]<sub>i</sub> at 0.2 to 20 µM with a subsecond time resolution and a high specificity over cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). gCarvi can be converted to a ratiometric probe for [cAMP]<sub>i</sub> quantification and its expression can be specifically targeted to various subcellular compartments. Monomeric gCarvi also enables simultaneous multisignal monitoring in combination with other indicators. As a proof of concept, simultaneous cAMP/Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging in hippocampal neurons revealed a tight linkage of cAMP to Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals. In cerebellar presynaptic boutons, forskolin induced nonuniform cAMP elevations among boutons, which positively correlated with subsequent increases in the size of the recycling pool of synaptic vesicles assayed using FM dye.

        "abstract": "The baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS) has become an important platform for the expression of recombinant proteins and is especially useful for the production of large protein complexes such as virus-like particles (VLPs). An important application for VLPs is their use as vehicles for targeted delivery of drugs or toxins which requires the development of methods for efficient loading with the intended cargo. Our research intends to employ the BEVS for the production of VLPs for the delivery of insecticidal dsRNA molecules to targeted insect pests (as \"dsRNA-VLPs\"). A convenient strategy would be the co-expression of long dsRNAs with viral capsid proteins and their simultaneous encapsulation during VLP assembly but the capacity of the BEVS for the production of long dsRNA has not been assessed so far. In this study, the efficiency of production of long RNA hairpins targeting the <i>luciferase</i> gene (\"dsLuc\") by the <i>polyhedrin</i> promoter during baculovirus infection was evaluated. However, RNAi reporter assays could not detect significant amounts of dsLuc in Hi5 cells infected with recombinant baculovirus, even in the presence of co-expressed dsRNA-binding protein B2-GFP or the employment of the MS2-MCP system. Nevertheless, dot blot analyses using anti-dsRNA antibody revealed that baculovirus-mediated expression of B2-GFP resulted in significant increases in dsRNA levels in infected cells that may correspond to hybridized complementary viral transcripts. Using B2-GFP as a genetically encoded sensor, dsRNA foci were detected in the nuclei that partially co-localized with DAPI staining, consistent with their localization at the virogenic stroma. Co-localization experiments with the baculovirus proteins vp39, Ac93, ODV-E25 and gp64 indicated limited overlap between B2-GFP and the ring zone compartment where assembly of nucleocapsids and virions occurs. Stability experiments showed that exogenous dsRNA is resistant to degradation in extracts of non-infected and infected Hi5 cells and it is proposed that strong unwinding activity at the virogenic stroma in the infected nuclei may neutralize the annealing of complementary RNA strands and block the production of long dsRNAs. Because the strong stability of exogenous dsRNA, transfection can be explored as an alternative method for delivery of cargo for dsRNA-VLPs during their assembly in baculovirus-infected Hi5 cells.",

However, the limited fluorescent properties of these proteins, such as their insufficient quantum yield and dynamic range, restrict their practical use. In this study, we developed an expression-screening-directed evolution system and used it to improve ZapCY1, a genetically encoded fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) sensor. After four rounds of directed evolution, the FRET dynamic range of the modified sensor (designated ZapTV-EH) was increased by 1.5-1.7-fold. With its enhanced signal-to-noise ratio and ability to detect a wide Zn<sup>2+</sup> concentration range, ZapTV-EH proves to be a better visualization tool for monitoring Zn<sup>2+</sup> at the subcellular level.

At the same time, there is a distinct lack of methods to effectively code linkers at the level of DNA and tailor them to the functional requirements of different fusion proteins. Addressing these limitations, a scalable framework is presented to compose co-polymeric linkers of variable lengths and amino acid composition based on a limited number of linker fragments stored in sequence-verified entry plasmids.

        "abstract": "In Alzheimer's disease (AD), synaptic dysfunction is thought to occur many years before the onset of cognitive decline. Detecting synaptic dysfunctions at the earliest stage of AD would be desirable in both clinic and research settings. Population voltage imaging allows monitoring of synaptic depolarizations, to which calcium imaging is relatively blind. We developed an AD mouse model (APPswe/PS1dE9 background) expressing a genetically-encoded voltage indicator (GEVI) in the neocortex. GEVI was restricted to the excitatory pyramidal neurons (unlike the voltage-sensitive dyes). Expression of GEVI did not disrupt AD model formation of amyloid plaques. GEVI expression was stable in both AD model mice and Control (healthy) littermates (CTRL) over 247 days postnatal. Brain slices were stimulated in layer 2/3. From the evoked voltage waveforms, we extracted several parameters for comparison AD versus CTRL. Some parameters (e.g., temporal summation, refractoriness, and peak latency) were weak predictors, while other parameters (e.g., signal amplitude, attenuation with distance, and duration (half-width) of the evoked transients) were stronger predictors of the AD condition. Around postnatal age 150 days (P150) and especially at P200, synaptically-evoked voltage signals in brain slices were weaker in the AD groups versus the age- and sex-matched CTRL groups, suggesting an AD-mediated synaptic weakening that coincides with the accumulation of plaques. However, at the youngest ages examined, P40 and P80, the AD groups showed differentially stronger signals, suggesting \"hyperexcitability\" prior to the formation of plaques. Our results indicate bidirectional alterations in cortical physiology in AD model mice; occurring both prior (P40-80), and after (P150-200) the amyloid deposition.",

While interactors for the class I interaction, which involves binding of a SUMO-interacting motif (SIM) to a hydrophobic groove in SUMO-1 and SUMO-2/3, are widely abundant, only a couple of examples have been reported for the other two types of interactions. Class II binding is conveyed by the E67 loop region on SUMO-1. Many previous studies to identify SUMO binders using pull-down or microarray approaches did not strategize on the SUMO binding mode. Identification of SUMO binding partners is further complicated due to the typically transient and low affinity interactions with the modifier. Here we aimed to identify SUMO-1 binders selectively enriched for class II binding. Using a genetically encoded photo-crosslinker approach, we have designed SUMO-1 probes to covalently capture class II SUMO-1 interactors by strategically positioning the photo-crosslinking moiety on the SUMO-1 surface. The probes were validated using known class II and class I binding partners. We utilized the probe with p-benzoyl-phenylalanine (BzF, also termed BpF or Bpa) at the position of Gln69 to identify binding proteins from mammalian cell extracts using mass spectrometry. By comparison with results obtained with a similarly designed SUMO-1 probe to target SIM-mediated binders of the class I type, we identified 192 and 96 proteins specifically enriched by either probe, respectively. The implicated preferential class I or class II binding modes of these proteins will further contribute to unveiling the complex interplay of SUMO-1-mediated interactions.",

Furthermore, live cell imaging of mitochondrial matrix-targeted G-Flamp2 confirmed cytosolic cAMP was able to enter the mitochondrial matrix. G-Flamp2 imaging also showed that adipose tissue extract activated the Gi protein-coupled orphan GPCR GPR50 in HEK293T cells. Taken together, our results showed that the high-performance of G-Flamp2 would facilitate sensitive intracellular cAMP imaging and activity measurement of compounds targeting GPCR-cAMP signaling pathway during early drug development.",

To monitor sarcomere shortening and relaxation in cardiomyocytes in real-time, we generated a α-cardiac actinin (ACTN2)-copepod (cop) green fluorescent protein (GFP<sup>+</sup>)-human-induced pluripotent stem cell line by using the CRISPR-Cas9 and a homology directed recombination approach.

        "abstract": "Secretion of the acrosome, a single vesicle located rostrally in the head of a mammalian sperm, through a process known as \"acrosome exocytosis\" (AE), is essential for fertilization. However, the mechanisms leading to and regulating this complex process are controversial. In particular, poor understanding of Ca2+ dynamics between sperm subcellular compartments and regulation of membrane fusion mechanisms have led to competing models of AE. Here, we developed a transgenic mouse expressing an Acrosome-targeted Sensor for Exocytosis (AcroSensE) to investigate the spatial and temporal Ca2+ dynamics in AE in live sperm. AcroSensE combines a genetically encoded Ca2+ indicator (GCaMP) fused with an mCherry indicator to spatiotemporally resolve acrosomal Ca2+ rise (ACR) and membrane fusion events, enabling real-time study of AE. We found that ACR is dependent on extracellular Ca2+ and that ACR precedes AE. In addition, we show that there are intermediate steps in ACR and that AE correlates better with the ACR rate rather than absolute Ca2+ amount. Finally, we demonstrate that ACR and membrane fusion progression kinetics and spatial patterns differ with different stimuli and that sites of initiation of ACR and sites of membrane fusion do not always correspond. These findings support a model involving functionally redundant pathways that enable a highly regulated, multistep AE in heterogeneous sperm populations, unlike the previously proposed \"acrosome reaction\" model.",

The fluctuations of lactate levels within biological tissues, in particular in the interstitial space, are crucial to assess with high spatial and temporal resolution, and this is best achieved using cellular imaging approaches. In this study, we evaluated the suitability of the lactate receptor, hydroxycarboxylic acid receptor 1 (HCAR1, formerly named GPR81), as a basis for the development of a genetically encoded fluorescent lactate biosensor. We used a biosensor strategy that was successfully applied to molecules such as dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine, based on their respective G-protein-coupled receptors. In this study, a set of intensiometric sensors was constructed and expressed in living cells. They showed selective expression at the plasma membrane and responded to physiological concentrations of lactate. However, these sensors lost the original ability of HCAR1 to selectively respond to lactate versus other related small carboxylic acid molecules. Therefore, while representing a promising building block for a lactate biosensor, HCAR1 was found to be sensitive to perturbations of its structure, affecting its ability to distinguish between related carboxylic molecules.",

However, the relationships between the redox status and ROS production during apoptosis remain poorly explored. In this study, we present an investigation on the correlations between the production of ROS, the redox ratio FAD/NAD(P)H, the proportions of the reduced nicotinamide cofactors NADH and NADPH, and caspase-3 activity in cancer cells at the level of individual cells. Two-photon excitation fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) was applied to monitor simultaneously apoptosis using the genetically encoded sensor of caspase-3, mKate2-DEVD-iRFP, and the autofluorescence of redox cofactors in colorectal cancer cells upon stimulation of apoptosis with staurosporine, cisplatin or hydrogen peroxide. We found that, irrespective of the apoptotic stimulus used, ROS accumulation correlated well with both the elevated pool of mitochondrial, enzyme-bound NADH and caspase-3 activation. Meanwhile, a shift in the contribution of bound NADH could develop independently of the apoptosis, and this was observed in the case of cisplatin. An increase in the proportion of bound NADPH was detected only in staurosporine-treated cells, this likely being associated with a high level of ROS production and their resulting detoxification. The results of the study favor the discovery of new therapeutic strategies based on manipulation of the cellular redox balance, which could help improve the anti-tumor activity of drugs and overcome apoptotic resistance.",

A plethora of synthetic switches, circuits, and even higher order networks has been implemented in different organisms, such as bacteria and mammalian cells, and facilitates the study of signaling and metabolic pathways.

For this, we utilized three different Aux/IAAs as sensor modules and analyzed their degradation behavior in response to auxin. Our experimental approach requires simple hardware and experimental reagents and can thus be implemented in every plant-related or cell culture laboratory.

In this context, the unicellular intraerythrocytic parasite <i>Plasmodium</i>, the causative agent of malaria, represents a challenge, as the small size of the organism results in weak fluorescence signals that complicate precise measurements, especially for cell compartment-specific observations.

To address this, we developed an endoplasmic reticulum-targeted calcium indicator, ER-GCaMP6f, which is anchored to the cytosolic side of the organelle and measures signaling that occurs in close proximity to the endoplasmic reticulum of astrocytes. Using a combination of confocal and super-resolution microscopy techniques, we demonstrate the localization of the indicator in the endoplasmic reticulum in both cell soma and processes of astrocytes. Combining ER-GCaMP6f with total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy, we show that Ca<sup>2+</sup> fluctuations in small astrocytic processes can be detected, which are otherwise not observable with existing indicators and standard wide-field and confocal techniques. We also compared the ER-GCaMP6f indicator against currently used plasma membrane-tethered and cytosolic GCaMP6f indicators. ER-GCaMP6f identifies dynamics in calcium signaling of endoplasmic reticulum resident receptors that are missed by plasma membrane-anchored indicators. We also generated an adeno-associated virus (AAV5) and demonstrate that ER-GCaMP6f can be expressed <i>in vivo</i> and by measured calcium activity in brain slices. ER-GCaMP6f provides a powerful tool to study calcium signaling in close proximity to the endoplasmic reticulum in astrocyte cell soma and processes both in culture and in brain slices.",

        "abstract": "Hippocampal place cells are a well-known object in neuroscience, but their place field formation in the first moments of navigating in a novel environment remains an ill-defined process. To address these dynamics, we performed in vivo imaging of neuronal activity in the CA1 field of the mouse hippocampus using genetically encoded green calcium indicators, including the novel NCaMP7 and FGCaMP7, designed specifically for in vivo calcium imaging. Mice were injected with a viral vector encoding calcium sensor, head-mounted with an NVista HD miniscope, and allowed to explore a completely novel environment (circular track surrounded by visual cues) without any reinforcement stimuli, in order to avoid potential interference from reward-related behavior. First, we calculated the average time required for each CA1 cell to acquire its place field. We found that 25% of CA1 place fields were formed at the first arrival in the corresponding place, while the average tuning latency for all place fields in a novel environment equaled 247 s. After 24 h, when the environment was familiar to the animals, place fields formed faster, independent of retention of cognitive maps during this session. No cumulation of selectivity score was observed between these two sessions. Using dimensionality reduction, we demonstrated that the population activity of rapidly tuned CA1 place cells allowed the reconstruction of the geometry of the navigated circular maze; the distribution of reconstruction error between the mice was consistent with the distribution of the average place field selectivity score in them. Our data thus show that neuronal activity recorded with genetically encoded calcium sensors revealed fast behavior-dependent plasticity in the mouse hippocampus, resulting in the rapid formation of place fields and population activity that allowed the reconstruction of the geometry of the navigated maze.",

As the only transporters known to facilitate the cellular release of sugars in plants, SWEETs play critical roles in the allocation of sugars from photosynthetic leaves to storage tissues in seeds, fruits, and tubers. Here, we report the design and use of genetically encoded biosensors to measure the activity of SWEETs. We created a SweetTrac1 sensor by inserting a circularly permutated green fluorescent protein into the <i>Arabidopsis</i> SWEET1, resulting in a chimera that translates substrate binding during the transport cycle into detectable changes in fluorescence intensity. We demonstrate that a combination of cell sorting and bioinformatics can accelerate the design of biosensors and formulate a mass action kinetics model to correlate the fluorescence response of SweetTrac1 with the transport of glucose. Our analysis suggests that SWEETs are low-affinity, symmetric transporters that can rapidly equilibrate intra- and extracellular concentrations of sugars. This approach can be extended to SWEET homologs and other transporters.",

An essential aspect of adaptation is ion regulation, and many insights into such complex processes can be obtained through measurement of the plasma membrane potential (PMP) of cells during stress. We recently established genetically encoded voltage indicator proteins that could be utilized to report the yeast PMP change in real time. In this work, we employed this method to monitor the early change in the PMP of yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae with intact cell wall, immediately following hyperosmotic up-shock due to various stress agents. The results pointed to differential effects of NaCl, sorbitol and polyethylene glycol (PEG) 6000. Yeast PMP was more responsive toward PEG 6000 than NaCl and sorbitol at comparable osmotic pressure, and PEG 6000 stimulated the largest response magnitude, followed by sorbitol and NaCl, respectively. After prolonged treatment, PEG 6000 also instigated distinct cell morphology from NaCl and sorbitol. Accordingly, this study presents new evidence supporting multiple pathways underlying yeast adaptation to varying hyperosmotic conditions, enabled through the optical physiology approach. Our findings promote better understanding of the yeast cellular response to hyperosmotic stress, with tenable relevance to the physiologically related plant cells.",

RNAP2 has a long heptapeptide repeat (Tyr1-Ser2-Pro3-Thr4-Ser5-Pro6-Ser7), and Ser2 is phosphorylated on an elongation form. To detect RNAP2 Ser2 phosphorylation (RNAP2 Ser2ph) in living cells, we developed a genetically encoded modification-specific intracellular antibody (mintbody) probe. The RNAP2 Ser2ph-mintbody exhibited numerous foci, possibly representing transcription \"factories,\" and foci were diminished during mitosis and in a Ser2 kinase inhibitor. An in vitro binding assay using phosphopeptides confirmed the mintbody's specificity. RNAP2 Ser2ph-mintbody foci were colocalized with proteins associated with elongating RNAP2 compared with factors involved in the initiation. These results support the view that mintbody localization represents the sites of RNAP2 Ser2ph in living cells. RNAP2 Ser2ph-mintbody foci showed constrained diffusional motion like chromatin, but they were more mobile than DNA replication domains and p300-enriched foci, suggesting that the elongating RNAP2 complexes are separated from more confined chromatin domains.",

Herbivory, for instance, appears to trigger local apoplasmic glutamate accumulation, systemic electrical signals, and calcium waves that travel to report insect damage to neighboring leaves and initiate defense. To monitor extra- and intracellular glutamate concentrations in plants, we generated Arabidopsis lines expressing genetically encoded fluorescent glutamate sensors. In contrast to cytosolically localized sensors, extracellularly displayed variants inhibited plant growth and proper development. Phenotypic analyses of high-affinity display sensor lines revealed that root meristem development, particularly the quiescent center, number of lateral roots, vegetative growth, and floral architecture were impacted. Notably, the severity of the phenotypes was positively correlated with the affinity of the display sensors, intimating that their ability to sequester glutamate at the surface of the plasma membrane was responsible for the defects. Root growth defects were suppressed by supplementing culture media with low levels of glutamate. Together, the data indicate that sequestration of glutamate at the cell surface either disrupts the supply of glutamate to meristematic cells and/or impairs localized glutamatergic signaling important for developmental processes.",

Here, we present Strigo-D2, a genetically encoded ratiometric SL signaling sensor that enables the examination of SL signaling distribution at cellular resolution and is capable of rapid response to altered SL levels in intact Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) plants. By monitoring the abundance of a truncated and fluorescently labeled SUPPRESSOR OF MAX2 1-LIKE 6 (SMXL6) protein, a proteolytic target of the SL signaling machinery, we show that all cell types investigated have the capacity to respond to changes in SL levels but with very different dynamics. In particular, SL signaling is pronounced in vascular cells but low in guard cells and the meristematic region of the root. We also show that other hormones leave Strigo-D2 activity unchanged, indicating that initial SL signaling steps work in isolation from other hormonal signaling pathways.

Here, we report on a sensing strategy in which a conformational change directly modifies the fluorescence quantum yield and fluorescence lifetime of a circular permutated turquoise fluorescent protein. The fluorescence lifetime is an absolute parameter that enables straightforward quantification, eliminating intensity-related artifacts. An engineering strategy that optimizes lifetime contrast led to a biosensor that shows a 3-fold change in the calcium-dependent quantum yield and a fluorescence lifetime change of 1.3 ns. We dub the biosensor Turquoise Calcium Fluorescence LIfeTime Sensor (Tq-Ca-FLITS). The response of the calcium sensor is insensitive to pH between 6.2-9.

Despite their physiological importance, untangling the relationship between DA and NE in the fine control of output function is currently challenging, primarily due to a lack of techniques to allow the observation of spatiotemporal dynamics with sufficiently high selectivity. Although genetically encoded fluorescent biosensors have been developed to detect DA, their poor selectivity prevents distinguishing DA from NE. Here, we report the development of a red fluorescent genetically encoded GPCR (G protein-coupled receptor)-activation reporter for DA termed 'R-GenGAR-DA'. More specifically, a circular permutated red fluorescent protein (cpmApple) was replaced by the third intracellular loop of human DA receptor D1 (DRD1) followed by the screening of mutants within the linkers between DRD1 and cpmApple. We developed two variants: R-GenGAR-DA1.1, which brightened following DA stimulation, and R-GenGAR-DA1.2, which dimmed. R-GenGAR-DA1.2 demonstrated a reasonable dynamic range (ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> = - 43%), DA affinity (EC<sub>50</sub> = 0.92 µM) and high selectivity for DA over NE (66-fold) in HeLa cells. Taking advantage of the high selectivity of R-GenGAR-DA1.2, we monitored DA in presence of NE using dual-color fluorescence live imaging, combined with the green-NE biosensor GRAB<sub>NE1m</sub>, which has high selectivity for NE over DA (> 350-fold) in HeLa cells and hippocampal neurons grown from primary culture. Thus, this is a first step toward the multiplex imaging of these neurotransmitters in, for example, freely moving animals, which will provide new opportunities to advance our understanding of the high spatiotemporal dynamics of DA and NE in normal and abnormal brain function.",

        "abstract": "Biocatalysis is increasingly used for synthetic purposes in the chemical and especially the pharmaceutical industry. Enzyme discovery and optimization which is frequently needed to improve biocatalytic performance rely on high-throughput methods for activity determination. These methods should ideally be generic and applicable to entire enzyme families. Hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) is a product of several biocatalytic oxidations and its formation can serve as a proxy for oxidative activity. We designed a genetically encoded sensor for activity measurement of oxidative biocatalysts <i>via</i> the amount of intracellularly-formed H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. A key component of the sensor is an H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-sensitive transcriptional regulator, OxyR, which is used to control the expression levels of fluorescent proteins. We employed the OxyR sensor to monitor the oxidation of glycerol to glyceraldehyde and of toluene to <i>o</i>-cresol catalysed by recombinant <i>E. coli</i> expressing an alcohol oxidase and a P450 monooxygenase, respectively. In case of the P450 BM3-catalysed reaction, we additionally monitored <i>o</i>-cresol formation <i>via</i> a second genetically encoded sensor based on the phenol-sensitive transcriptional activator, DmpR, and an orthogonal fluorescent reporter protein. Single round screens of mutant libraries by flow cytometry or by visual inspection of colonies on agar plates yielded significantly improved oxidase and oxygenase variants thus exemplifying the suitability of the sensor system to accurately assess whole-cell oxidations in a high-throughput manner.",

        "abstract": "Genetically encoded reporters have greatly increased our understanding of biology. While fluorescent reporters have been widely used, photostability and phototoxicity have hindered their use in long-term experiments. Bioluminescence overcomes some of these challenges but requires the addition of an exogenous luciferin limiting its use. Using a modular approach, Autonomous Molecular BioluminEscent Reporter (AMBER), an indicator of membrane potential is engineered. Unlike other bioluminescent systems, AMBER is a voltage-gated luciferase coupling the functionalities of the Ciona voltage-sensing domain (VSD) and bacterial luciferase, luxAB. When co-expressed with the luciferin-producing genes, AMBER reversibly switches the bioluminescent intensity as a function of membrane potential. Using biophysical and biochemical methods, it is shown that AMBER switches its enzymatic activity from an OFF to an ON state as a function of the membrane potential. Upon depolarization, AMBER switches from a low to a high enzymatic activity state, showing a several-fold increase in the bioluminescence output (ΔL/L). AMBER in the pharyngeal muscles and mechanosensory touch neurons of Caenorhabditis elegans is expressed. Using the compressed sensing approach, the electropharingeogram of the C. elegans pharynx is reconstructed, validating the sensor in vivo. Thus, AMBER represents the first fully genetically encoded bioluminescent reporter without requiring exogenous luciferin addition.",

UDP-GlcNAc is thus a central metabolite connecting nutrition, metabolism, signaling, and disease. There is a great interest in monitoring UDP-GlcNAc in biological systems. Here, we present the first genetically encoded, green fluorescent UDP-GlcNAc sensor (UGAcS), an optimized insertion of a circularly permuted green fluorescent protein (cpGFP) into an inactive mutant of an <i>Escherichia coli</i> UDP-GlcNAc transferase, for ratiometric monitoring of UDP-GlcNAc dynamics in live mammalian cells. Although UGAcS responds to UDP-GlcNAc quite selectively among various nucleotide sugars, UDP and uridine triphosphate (UTP) interfere with the response. We thus developed another biosensor named UXPS, which is responsive to UDP and UTP but not UDP-GlcNAc. We demonstrated the use of the biosensors to follow UDP-GlcNAc levels in cultured mammalian cells perturbed with nutritional changes, pharmacological inhibition, and knockdown or overexpression of key enzymes in the UDP-GlcNAc synthesis pathway.

        "abstract": "Membrane-less organelles (MLOs) formed by liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) play pivotal roles in biological processes. During LLPS, proteins and nucleotides are extremely condensed, resulting in changes in their conformation and biological functions. Disturbed LLPS homeostasis in MLOs is thought to associate with fatal diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Therefore, it is important to detect changes in the degree of crowding in MLOs. However, it has not been investigated well due to the lack of an appropriate method. To address this, we developed a genetically encoded macromolecular crowding sensor CRONOS (crowding sensor with mNeonGreen and mScarlet-I) that senses the degree of macromolecular crowding in MLOs using a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) system. CRONOS is a bright biosensor with a wide dynamic range and successfully detects changes in the macromolecular volume fraction in solution. By fusing to the scaffold protein of each MLO, we delivered CRONOS to MLO of interest and detected previously undescribed differences in the degree of crowding in each MLO. CRONOS also detected changes in the degree of macromolecular crowding in nucleolus induced by environmental stress or inhibition of transcription. These findings suggest that CRONOS can be a useful tool for the determination of molecular crowding and detection of pathological changes in MLOs in live cells.",

Here, we used engineered cortisol-detecting sensor cells to screen for natural mimetics of cortisol.

The developed sensor cells were able to detect known biological targets from human-derived analytes as well as natural product extracts, such as deer antlers and ginseng. The multi-use capability and versatility to screen in different cellular environments were also demonstrated. The sensor cells were used to identify novel GR effectors from medicinal plant extracts. Our results suggest that decursin from dongquai had the GR effector function as a selective GR agonist (SEGRA), making it a potent drug candidate with anti-inflammatory activity.

Here, a genetically encoded protein thermometer (human enhanced gene activation thermometer; HEAT) is designed that can trigger transgene expression in the range of 37-40 °C by linking a mutant coiled-coil temperature-responsive protein sensor to a synthetic transcription factor. To validate the construct, a HEAT-transgenic monoclonal human cell line, FeverSense, is generated and it is confirmed that it works as a fever sensor that can temperature- and exposure-time-dependently trigger reporter gene expression in vitro and in vivo. For translational proof of concept, microencapsulated designer cells stably expressing a HEAT-controlled insulin production cassette in a mouse model of type-1 diabetes are subcutaneously implanted and topical heating patches are used to apply heat corresponding to a warm sensation in humans.

The H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> increase coincides with the intracellular NAD(P)H decrease and is absent in NOX2 KO islets. NOX2 KO confers better glucose tolerance and protects against cytokine-induced islet secretory dysfunction and death.

Gene perturbation screens could provide a powerful approach to probe the molecular mechanisms of protein trafficking, but only if protein localization or mislocalization can be tied to a simple and robust phenotype for cell selection, such as cell proliferation or fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). To empower the study of protein trafficking processes with gene perturbation, we developed a genetically encoded molecular tool named HiLITR (High-throughput Localization Indicator with Transcriptional Readout). HiLITR converts protein colocalization into proteolytic release of a membrane-anchored transcription factor, which drives the expression of a chosen reporter gene. Using HiLITR in combination with FACS-based CRISPRi screening in human cell lines, we identified genes that influence the trafficking of mitochondrial and ER tail-anchored proteins. We show that loss of the SUMO E1 component SAE1 results in mislocalization and destabilization of many mitochondrial tail-anchored proteins. We also demonstrate a distinct regulatory role for EMC10 in the ER membrane complex, opposing the transmembrane-domain insertion activity of the complex. Through transcriptional integration of complex cellular functions, HiLITR expands the scope of biological processes that can be studied by genetic perturbation screening technologies.",

However, GETIs have suffered from poor temperature sensitivity, which may not be sufficient to resolve small heat production from a biological process. Here, we develop a highly-sensitive GETI, denoted as ELP-TEMP, comprised of a temperature-responsive elastin-like polypeptide (ELP) fused with a cyan fluorescent protein (FP), mTurquoise2 (mT), and a yellow FP, mVenus (mV), as the donor and acceptor, respectively, of Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET). At elevated temperatures, the ELP moiety in ELP-TEMP undergoes a phase transition leading to an increase in the FRET efficiency. In HeLa cells, ELP-TEMP responded to the temperature from 33 to 40 °C with a maximum temperature sensitivity of 45.1 ± 8.1%/°C, which was the highest ever temperature sensitivity among hitherto-developed fluorescent nanothermometers. Although ELP-TEMP showed sensitivity not only to temperature but also to macromolecular crowding and self-concentration, we were able to correct the output of ELP-TEMP to achieve accurate temperature measurements at a subcellular resolution. We successfully applied ELP-TEMP to accurately measure temperature changes in cells induced by a local heat spot, even if the temperature difference was as small as < 1 °C, and to visualize heat production from stimulated Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx in live HeLa cells induced by a chemical stimulation. Furthermore, we investigated temperatures in the nucleus and cytoplasm of live HeLa cells and found that their temperatures were almost the same within the temperature resolution of our measurement. Our study would contribute to better understanding of cellular temperature dynamics, and ELP-TEMP would be a useful GETI for the investigation of cell thermobiology.",

The generation of ROS can be both the cause and a consequence of ER stress pathways, and an increasing number of human diseases are characterized by tissue atrophy in response to ER stress and oxidative injury. For the assessment of modulators of ER luminal ROS generation and for mechanistic studies, methods to monitor changes in ER reduction-oxidation (redox) states in a time-resolved and organelle-specific manner are needed. This has been greatly facilitated by the development of genetically encoded fluorescent probes, which can be targeted to different subcellular locations by specific amino acid extensions.

We engineered a set of green-red ratiometric calcium sensors that fused two fluorescent proteins and calcium sensing domain within an alternate configuration. The best performing elements of this palette of sensors, Twitch-GR and Twitch-NR, inherited the superior photophysical properties of their constituent fluorescent proteins.

        "abstract": "Acetylation of lysine in the histone H4 N-terminal is one of the most significant epigenetic modifications in cells. Aberrant changes involving lysine acetylation modification are commonly reported in multiple types of cancers. Currently, whether it is for in vivo or in vitro, there are limited approaches for the detection of H4 lysine acetylation levels. In particular, the main problems are the high cost and the cumbersome detection process, such as for radioactive <sup>14</sup>C isotope detection. Therefore, there is an important need to develop a simple, fast, and low-cost means of detection. In this study, we reported the development of a gene-coding protein sensor. This protein sensor was designed based on the mechanism of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). The four kinds of sensors, varying from substrate and linker length, were evaluated, with ~20% increases in response efficiency. Next, sensors with different lysine mutation sites in the substrate sequence or mutation of key amino acids in the binding domain were also analyzed to determine site specificity. We found single-site lysine mutant could not cause a significant decrease in response efficiency. Furthermore, addition of MG149, a histone acetyltransferase inhibitor, resulted in a decrease in the ratio change value. Moreover, histone deacetylase1 HDAC1 was also found to reduce the ratio change values when added to reaction system. Finally, the optimized sensor was applied to living cells and established to provide a sensitive response with overexpression and knockdown of MOF (males absent on the first). These results indicated that the sensor can be used for screening chemical drugs regulating H4 N-terminal lysine acetylation level in vitro, as well as monitoring dynamic changes of lysine acetylation levels in living cells.",

For three resulting sensor constructs the corresponding glucose induced conformational changes were measured by small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and compared to recently published single molecule FRET results (Höfig et al., <i>ACS Sensors</i>, 2018). For one construct which exhibits a high change in energy transfer and a large change of the radius of gyration upon ligand binding, we performed coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations for the ligand-free and the ligand-bound state. Our analysis indicates that a carefully designed attachment of the donor FP is crucial for the proper transfer of the glucose induced conformational change of the glucose binding protein into a well pronounced FRET signal change as measured in this sensor construct. Since the other FP (acceptor) does not experience such a glucose induced alteration, it becomes apparent that only one of the FPs needs to have a well-adjusted attachment to the glucose binding protein.",

        "abstract": "<i>N</i>-acetyl-5-neuraminic acid (NeuAc) plays crucial role in improving the growth, brain development, brain health maintenance, and immunity enhancement of infants. Commercially, it is used in the production of antiviral drugs, infant milk formulas, cosmetics, dietary supplements, and pharmaceutical products. Because of the rapidly increasing demand, metabolic engineering approach has attracted increasing attention for NeuAc biosynthesis. However, knowledge of metabolite flux in biosynthetic pathways is one of the major challenges in the practice of metabolic engineering. So, an understanding of the flux of NeuAc is needed to determine its cellular level at real time. The analysis of the flux can only be performed using a tool that has the capacity to measure metabolite level in cells without affecting other metabolic processes. A Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET)-based genetically-encoded nanosensor has been generated in this study to monitor the level of NeuAc in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. Sialic acid periplasmic binding protein (SiaP) from <i>Haemophilus influenzae</i> was exploited as a sensory element for the generation of nanosensor. The enhanced cyan fluorescent protein (ECFP) and Venus were used as Fluroscence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) pair. The nanosensor, which was termed fluorescent indicator protein for sialic acid (FLIP-SA), was successfully transformed into, and expressed in <i>Escherichia coli</i> BL21 (DE3) cells. The expressed protein of the nanosensor was isolated and purified. The purified nanosensor protein was characterized to assess the affinity, specificity, and stability in the pH range. The developed nanosensor exhibited FRET change after addition to NeuAc. The developed nanosensor was highly specific, exhibited pH stability, and detected NeuAc levels in the nanomolar to milimolar range. FLIP-SA was successfully introduced in bacterial and yeast cells and reported the real-time intracellular levels of NeuAc non-invasively. The FLIP-SA is an excellent tool for the metabolic flux analysis of the NeuAc biosynthetic pathway and, thus, may help unravel the regulatory mechanism of the metabolic pathway of NeuAc. Furthermore, FLIP-SA can be used for the high-throughput screening of <i>E. coli</i> mutant libraries for varied NeuAc production levels.",

        "abstract": "Melanocytes are specialized cells that produce melanin pigments responsible for skin, hair, and eye pigmentation. The synthesis and storage of melanin occurs in unique lysosome-related organelles called melanosomes, which regulate melanin production via complex regulatory mechanisms. Maintenance of the melanosome luminal ionic environment and pH is crucial for proper function of the main melanogenic enzymes. Defects in genes encoding pH-regulating melanosomal proteins result in oculocutaneous albinism, which is characterized by hypopigmentation, impaired vision, and increased susceptibility to skin and eye cancers. We recently uncovered several ion channels and transporters that modulate melanin synthesis by acidifying or neutralizing the luminal pH of melanosomes. However, our understanding of how melanosomes and other related organelles maintain their luminal pH is far from complete. The study of melanosome pH regulation requires robust imaging and quantification tools. Despite recent advances in the development of such methods, many limitations remain, particularly for quantitative analysis of individual organelle pH. In this chapter, we will provide an overview of the available methods used for melanosome pH determination, including their advantages, limitations, and challenges. To address the critical, unmet need for reliable melanosome pH quantification tools, we engineered a novel genetically encoded, ratiometric pH sensor for melanosomes that we named RpHiMEL. Here, we describe the design and optimization of RpHiMEL, and provide a pH quantification method for individual melanosomes in live cells. We demonstrate that RpHiMEL is a highly versatile tool with the potential to advance our understanding of pH regulation in melanosomes and related organelles.",

MCS between any known intercellular organelles, including endoplasmic reticulum (ER), mitochondria, Golgi, endosomes, peroxisomes, lysosomes, lipid droplets, and the plasma membrane (PM), have been largely documented and in some cases the molecules responsible for the tethering also identified. They represent specific membrane hubs where a tightly coordinated exchange of ions, lipids, nutrients, and factors required to maintain proper cellular homeostasis takes place. Their delicate, dynamic, and sometimes elusive nature prevented and/or delayed the development of tools to easily image interorganelle proximity under physiological conditions and in living organisms. Nowadays, this aspect received great momentum due to the finding that MCSs' dysregulation is involved in several pathological conditions. We have recently developed modular, split-GFP-based contact site sensors (SPLICS) engineered to fluoresce when homo- and heterotypic juxtapositions between ER and mitochondria occur over a range of specific distances.

Genetically encoded fluorescent biosensors are powerful tools to dissect compartmentalized signaling, but current approaches to probe these microdomains typically rely on biosensor fusion and overexpression of critical regulatory elements. Here, we present a novel class of biosensors named FluoSTEPs (fluorescent sensors targeted to endogenous proteins) that combine self-complementing split green fluorescent protein, CRISPR-mediated knock-in, and fluorescence resonance energy transfer biosensor technology to probe compartmentalized signaling dynamics in situ. We designed FluoSTEPs for simultaneously highlighting endogenous microdomains and reporting domain-specific, real-time signaling events including kinase activities, guanosine triphosphatase activation, and second messenger dynamics in live cells. A FluoSTEP for 3',5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) revealed distinct cAMP dynamics within clathrin microdomains in response to stimulation of G protein-coupled receptors, showcasing the utility of FluoSTEPs in probing spatiotemporal regulation within endogenous signaling architectures.",

The sensors are designed so that the interhelical stabilizing interactions in the three-way junction are only induced upon ligand binding. We use these RNA-based devices to measure the dynamics of S-adenosylmethionine levels in mammalian cells in real time. We show that this strategy is compatible with diverse metabolite-binding RNA aptamers, fluorogenic aptamers, and three-way junctions. Overall, these data demonstrate a versatile method for readily generating RNA devices that function in living cells.",

Phosphorylation levels at Ser2 in heptad repeats within the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II, representing the elongation form, is an indicator of transcription.

This sucrose sensor was engineered on the basis of an <i>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</i> sugar-binding protein.

The resulting series of sucrose sensors may enable investigation of sucrose transporter candidates and comprehensive in vivo analyses of sucrose concentration in plants.

The cellular devices can be used for sensing and responding to natural and artificial signals. However, a major challenge in the field is that the crosstalk between many cellular signaling pathways use the same signaling endogenous molecules that can result in undesired activation. To overcome this problem, we utilized a specific promoter that can activate genes with a natural, non-toxic ligand at a highly-induced transcription level with low background or undesirable off-target expression. Here we used the orphan aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), a ligand-activated transcription factor that upon activation binds to specific AHR response elements (AHRE) of the Cytochrome P450, family 1, subfamily A, polypeptide 1 (CYP1A1) promoter. Flavonoids have been identified as AHR ligands. Data presented here show the successful creation of a synthetic gene \"off\" switch that can be monitored directly using an optical reporter gene.

However, currently available methods are inadequate for directly assessing 5-HT2AR conformation both in vitro and in vivo. Here, we developed psychLight, a genetically encoded fluorescent sensor based on the 5-HT2AR structure. PsychLight detects behaviorally relevant serotonin release and correctly predicts the hallucinogenic behavioral effects of structurally similar 5-HT2AR ligands. We further used psychLight to identify a non-hallucinogenic psychedelic analog, which produced rapid-onset and long-lasting antidepressant-like effects after a single administration.

As a result of the depletion of its natural sources, researchers have tried to employ metabolic engineering to enhance α-tocopherol production to meet the human consumption demand. However, the metabolic engineering approach relies on the metabolic flux of a metabolite in its biosynthetic pathway. Analysis of the metabolic flux of a metabolite needs a method that can monitor the α-tocopherol level in living cells. This study was undertaken to construct a FRET (fluorescence resonance energy transfer)-based nanosensor for monitoring the α-tocopherol flux in prokaryotic and eukaryotic living cells. The human α-TTP was sandwiched between a pair of FRET fluorophores to construct the nanosensor, which was denoted as FLIP-α (the fluorescence indicator for α-tocopherol). FLIP-α showed excellence in monitoring the α-tocopherol flux with high specificity. The sensor was examined for its pH stability for physiological applications, where it shows no pH hindrance to its activity. The calculated affinity of this nanosensor was 100 μM. It monitored the real-time flux of α-tocopherol in bacterial and yeast cells, proving its biocompatibility in monitoring the α-tocopherol dynamics in living cells. Being noninvasive, FLIP-α provides high temporal and spatial resolutions, which holds an indispensable significance in bioimaging metabolic pathways that are highly compartmentalized.",

Its dynamic redistribution has an essential role in almost every aspect of plant life, ranging from cell shape and division to organogenesis and responses to light and gravity<sup>1,2</sup>. So far, it has not been possible to directly determine the spatial and temporal distribution of auxin at a cellular resolution. Instead it is inferred from the visualization of irreversible processes that involve the endogenous auxin-response machinery<sup>3-7</sup>; however, such a system cannot detect transient changes. Here we report a genetically encoded biosensor for the quantitative in vivo visualization of auxin distribution. The sensor is based on the Escherichia coli tryptophan repressor<sup>8</sup>, the binding pocket of which is engineered to be specific to auxin. Coupling of the auxin-binding moiety with selected fluorescent proteins enables the use of a fluorescence resonance energy transfer signal as a readout. Unlike previous systems, this sensor enables direct monitoring of the rapid uptake and clearance of auxin by individual cells and within cell compartments in planta. By responding to the graded spatial distribution along the root axis and its perturbation by transport inhibitors-as well as the rapid and reversible redistribution of endogenous auxin in response to changes in gravity vectors-our sensor enables real-time monitoring of auxin concentrations at a (sub)cellular resolution and their spatial and temporal changes during the lifespan of a plant.",

While recent advancements of fluorescence microscopy including super-resolution microscopy have enabled us to determine the positions of fluorophores with unprecedented accuracy, monitoring the orientation of fluorescently labeled molecules within living cells in real time is challenging. Fluorescence polarization microscopy (FPM) reports the orientation of emission dipoles and is therefore a promising solution. For imaging with FPM, target proteins need labeling with fluorescent probes in a sterically constrained manner, but because of difficulties in the rational three-dimensional design of protein connection, a universal method for constrained tagging with fluorophore was not available. Here, we report POLArIS, a genetically encoded and versatile probe for molecular orientation imaging. Instead of using a direct tagging approach, we used a recombinant binder connected to a fluorescent protein in a sterically constrained manner that can target specific biomolecules of interest by combining with phage display screening. As an initial test case, we developed POLArIS<sup>act</sup>, which specifically binds to F-actin in living cells.

To fill this need, we designed and characterized a genetically encoded fluorescent reporter, called Single-chain Protein-based Opioid Transmission Indicator Tool for MOR (M-SPOTIT). M-SPOTIT represents a new and unique mechanism for fluorescent reporter design and can detect MOR activation, leaving a persistent green fluorescence mark for image analysis. M-SPOTIT showed an opioid-dependent signal to noise ratio (S/N) up to 12.5 and was able to detect as fast as a 30-second opioid exposure in HEK293T cell culture.

Among the different ROS, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is best characterized with respect to roles in cellular signaling. H2O2 has been implicated during the development in several species. For example, a transient increase in H2O2 has been detected in zebrafish embryos during the first days following fertilization. Furthermore, depleting an important cellular H2O2 source, NADPH oxidase (NOX), impairs nervous system development such as the differentiation, axonal growth, and guidance of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) both in vivo and in vitro. Here, we describe a method for imaging intracellular H2O2 levels in cultured zebrafish neurons and whole larvae during development using the genetically encoded H2O2-specific biosensor, roGFP2-Orp1. This probe can be transiently or stably expressed in zebrafish larvae. Furthermore, the ratiometric readout diminishes the probability of detecting artifacts due to differential gene expression or volume effects. First, we demonstrate how to isolate and culture RGCs derived from zebrafish embryos that transiently express roGFP2-Orp1. Then, we use whole larvae to monitor H2O2 levels at the tissue level. The sensor has been validated by the addition of H2O2. Additionally, this methodology could be used to measure H2O2 levels in specific cell types and tissues by generating transgenic animals with tissue-specific biosensor expression. As zebrafish facilitate genetic and developmental manipulations, the approach demonstrated here could serve as a pipeline to test the role of H2O2 during neuronal and general embryonic development in vertebrates.",

Continued development and optimization in GECIs, combined with advances in gene manipulation, offer new opportunities for investigating the mechanism of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in fungi, ranging from documenting Ca<sup>2+</sup> signatures under diverse conditions and genetic backgrounds to evaluating how changes in Ca<sup>2+</sup> signature impact calcium-binding proteins and subsequent cellular changes. Here, we attempted to express multi-color (green, yellow, blue, cyan, and red) circularly permuted fluorescent protein (FP)-based Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicators driven by multiple fungal promoters in Fusarium oxysporum, F. graminearum, and Neurospora crassa. Several variants were successfully expressed, with GCaMP5G driven by the Magnaporthe oryzae ribosomal protein 27 and F. verticillioides elongation factor-1α gene promoters being optimal for F. graminearum and F. oxysporum, respectively. Transformants expressing GCaMP5G were compared with those expressing YC3.60, a ratiometric Cameleon Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator. Wild-type and three Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling mutants of F. graminearum expressing GCaMP5G exhibited improved signal-to-noise and increased temporal and spatial resolution and are also more amenable to studies involving multiple FPs compared to strains expressing YC3.60.",

        "abstract": "Ca<sup>2+</sup> cycling plays a critical role in regulating cardiomyocyte (CM) function under both physiological and pathological conditions. Mitochondria have been implicated in Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling in adult cardiomyocytes (ACMs). However, little is known about their role in the regulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics in human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs). In the present study, we developed a multifunctional genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> probe capable of simultaneously measuring cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> in real time. Using this novel probe, we determined and compared mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity and the coupling with cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics in hiPSC-CMs and ACMs. Our data showed that while ACMs displayed a highly coordinated beat-by-beat response in mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> in sync with cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup>, hiPSC-CMs showed high cell-wide variability in mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity that is poorly coordinated with cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup>. We then revealed that mitochondrial-sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) tethering, as well as the inter-mitochondrial network connection, is underdeveloped in hiPSC-CM compared to ACM, which may underlie the observed spatiotemporal decoupling between cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics. Finally, we showed that knockdown of mitofusin-2 (Mfn2), a protein tethering mitochondria and SR, led to reduced cytosolic-mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> coupling in ACMs, albeit to a lesser degree compared to hiPSC-CMs, suggesting that Mfn2 is a potential engineering target for improving mitochondrial-cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> coupling in hiPSC-CMs. Physiological relevance: The present study will advance our understanding of the role of mitochondria in Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling and cycling in CMs, and guide the development of hiPSC-CMs for healing injured hearts.",

        "abstract": "Eukaryotic cells exploit dynamic and compartmentalized ionic strength to impact a myriad of biological functions such as enzyme activities, protein-protein interactions, and catalytic functions. Herein, we investigated the fluorescence depolarization dynamics of recently developed ionic strength biosensors (mCerulean3-linker-mCitrine) in Hofmeister salt (KCl, NaCl, NaI, and Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>) solutions. The mCerulean3-mCitrine acts as a Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) pair, tethered together by two oppositely charged α-helices in the linker region. We developed a time-resolved fluorescence depolarization anisotropy approach for FRET analyses, in which the donor (mCerulean3) is excited by 425-nm laser pulses, followed by fluorescence depolarization analysis of the acceptor (mCitrine) in KE (lysine-glutamate), arginine-aspartate, and arginine-glutamate ionic strength sensors with variable amino acid sequences. Similar experiments were carried out on the cleaved sensors as well as an E6G2 construct, which has neutral α-helices in the linker region, as a control. Our results show distinct dynamics of the intact and cleaved sensors. Importantly, the FRET efficiency decreases and the donor-acceptor distance increases as the environmental ionic strength increases. Our chemical equilibrium analyses of the collapsed-to-stretched conformational state transition of KE reveal that the corresponding equilibrium constant and standard Gibbs free energy changes are ionic strength dependent. We also tested the existing theoretical models for FRET analyses using steady-state anisotropy, which reveal that the angle between the dipole moments of the donor and acceptor in the KE sensor are sensitive to the ionic strength. These results help establish the time-resolved depolarization dynamics of these genetically encoded donor-acceptor pairs as a quantitative means for FRET analysis, which complement traditional methods such as time-resolved fluorescence for future in vivo studies.",

Despite considerable progress made to elucidate the players and mechanisms involved in histone ubiquitination, there remains a lack of tools to monitor these PTMs, especially in live cells. To address this, we combined an avidity-based strategy with in silico approaches to design sensors for specifically ubiquitinated nucleosomes. By linking Ub-binding domains to nucleosome-binding peptides, we engineered proteins that target H2AK13/15Ub and H2BK120Ub with Kd values from 10-8 to 10-6 M; when fused to fluorescent proteins, they work as PTM sensors in cells.

        "abstract": "The phase of the cell cycle determines numerous aspects of cancer cell behaviour including invasiveness, ability to migrate and responsiveness to cytotoxic drugs. To non-invasively monitor progression of cell cycle in vivo, a family of genetically encoded fluorescent indicators, FUCCI (fluorescent ubiquitination-based cell cycle indicator), has been developed. Existing versions of FUCCI are based on fluorescent proteins of two or more different colors fused to cell-cycle-dependent degradation motifs. Thus, FUCCI-expressing cells emit light of different colors in different phases providing a robust way to monitor cell cycle progression by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry but limiting the possibility to simultaneously visualize other markers. To overcome this limitation, we developed a single-color variant of FUCCI, called FUCCI-Red, which utilizes two red fluorescent proteins with distinct fluorescence lifetimes, mCherry and mKate2. Similarly to FUCCI, these proteins carry cell cycle-dependent degradation motifs to resolve G1 and S/G2/M phases. We showed utility of FUCCI-Red by visualizing cell cycle progression of cancer cells in 2D and 3D cultures and monitoring development of tumors in vivo by confocal and fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM). Single-channel registration and red-shifted spectra make FUCCI-Red sensor a promising instrument for multiparameter in vivo imaging applications, which was demonstrated by simultaneous detection of cellular metabolic state using endogenous fluorescence in the blue range.",

We developed a genetically encoded probe to identify glutamatergic synaptic vesicles at the levels of both light and electron microscopy (EM) by fusing the mini singlet oxygen generator (miniSOG) probe to an intralumenal loop of the vesicular glutamate transporter-2. We then used a 3D imaging method, serial block-face scanning EM, combined with a deep learning approach for automatic segmentation of labeled synaptic vesicles to assess the subcellular distribution of transporter-defined vesicles at nanometer scale.

Recently, we have shown that nuclear calcium elevation triggers rapid and transient actin filament assembly inside the nucleus.

By fusing a nuclear localization signal to jGCaMP7f, we achieved highly efficient nuclear-specific targeting. Comparing the jGCaMP7f-NLS probe with the previous GCaMP6f-NLS calcium sensor showed clearly that jGCaMP7f-NLS is more sensitive and reverses significantly quicker thereby reflecting rapid nuclear calcium transients in a closely physiological manner. We further confirm that nuclear calcium transients precede nuclear actin polymerization by several seconds. Our data show that calcium-triggered nuclear actin assembly in fibroblasts is independent of the actin nucleating Arp2/3 complex. Together, jGCaMP7f-NLS represents an easy to use, reliable and highly sensitive nuclear calcium sensor that allows to tightly interrogate real-time, spatiotemporal calcium signalling and calcium-elicited effects in the nucleus of living cells.",

While C. albicans is a heme prototroph, we show here that it can also efficiently utilise external heme as a cellular heme source. Using genetically encoded ratiometric fluorescent heme sensors, we show that heme extracted from haemoglobin and free hemin enter the cells with different kinetics. Heme supplied as haemoglobin is taken up via the Common in Fungal Extracellular Membrane (CFEM) hemophore cascade, and reaches the cytoplasm over several hours, whereas entry of free hemin via CFEM-dependent and independent pathways is much faster, less than an hour. To prevent an influx of extracellular heme from reaching toxic levels in the cytoplasm, the cells deploy Hmx1, a heme oxygenase. Hmx1 was previously suggested to be involved in utilisation of haemoglobin and hemin as iron sources, but we find that it is primarily required to prevent heme toxicity. Taken together, the combination of novel heme sensors with genetic analysis revealed new details of the fungal mechanisms of heme import and homeostasis, necessary to balance the uses of heme as essential cofactor and potential iron source against its toxicity.",

Compared to the R-GECO1 indicator in vitro, the purified protein FRCaMP had similar spectral characteristics, brightness, and pH stability but a 1.3-fold lower ΔF/F calcium response and 2.6-fold tighter calcium affinity with K<sub>d</sub> of 441 nM and 2.4-6.6-fold lower photostability. In the cytosol of cultured HeLa cells, FRCaMP visualized calcium transients with a ΔF/F dynamic range of 5.6, which was similar to that of R-GECO1. FRCaMP robustly visualized the spontaneous activity of neuronal cultures and had a similar ΔF/F dynamic range of 1.7 but 2.1-fold faster decay kinetics vs. NCaMP7. On electrically stimulated cultured neurons, FRCaMP demonstrated 1.8-fold faster decay kinetics and 1.7-fold lower ΔF/F values per one action potential of 0.23 compared to the NCaMP7 indicator.

        "abstract": "Oxygen levels in plant tissues may vary, depending on metabolism, diffusion barriers, and environmental availability. Current techniques to assess the oxic status of plant cells rely primarily on invasive microoptodes or Clark-type electrodes, which are not optimally suited for experiments that require high spatial and temporal resolution. In this case, a genetically encoded oxygen biosensor is required instead. This article reports the design, test, and optimization of a hypoxia-signaling reporter, based on five-time repeated hypoxia-responsive promoter elements (HRPE) driving the expression of different reporter proteins. Specifically, this study aimed to improve its performance as a reporter of hypoxic conditions by testing the effect of different untranslated regions (UTRs) at the 5' end of the reporter coding sequence. Next, we characterized an optimized version of the <i>HRPE</i> promoter (<i>HRPE-Ω</i>) in terms of hypoxia sensitivity and time responsiveness. We also observed that severe oxygen deficiency counteracted the reporter activity due to inhibition of GFP maturation, which requires molecular oxygen. To overcome this limitation, we therefore employed an oxygen-independent UnaG fluorescent protein-coupled to an O<sub>2</sub>-dependent mCherry fluorophore under the control of the optimized <i>HRPE-Ω</i> promoter. Remarkably, this sensor, provided a different mCherry/UnaG ratiometric output depending on the externally imposed oxygen concentration, providing a solution to distinguish between different degrees of tissue hypoxia. Moreover, a ubiquitously expressed UnaG-mCherry fusion could be used to image oxygen concentrations directly, albeit at a narrow range. The luminescent and fluorescent hypoxia-reporters described here can readily be used to conduct studies that involve anaerobiosis in plants.",

The H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> also acts as a central signaling molecule and regulates numerous pathways in living cells. To better understand the generation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in environmental responses and its role in cellular signaling, there is a need to study the flux of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> at high spatio-temporal resolution in a real-time fashion. Herein, we developed a genetically encoded Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET)-based nanosensor (FLIP-H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) by sandwiching the regulatory domain (RD) of OxyR between two fluorescent moieties, namely ECFP and mVenus. This nanosensor was pH stable, highly selective to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, and showed insensitivity to other oxidants like superoxide anions, nitric oxide, and peroxynitrite. The FLIP-H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> demonstrated a broad dynamic range and having a binding affinity (Kd) of 247 µM. Expression of sensor protein in living bacterial, yeast, and mammalian cells showed the localization of the sensor in the cytosol. The flux of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> was measured in these live cells using the FLIP-H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> under stress conditions or by externally providing the ligand. Time-dependent FRET-ratio changes were recorded, which correspond to the presence of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Using this sensor, real-time information of the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> level can be obtained non-invasively. Thus, this nanosensor would help to understand the adverse effect of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> on cell physiology and its role in redox signaling.",

The morphology of corneal nerves has been studied extensively. However, corneal nerve function has only been studied in a limited fashion owing to a lack of tools. Here, we present a new system for studying corneal nerve function. Optical imaging was performed on the cornea of excised murine globes taken from a model animal expressing a genetically encoded calcium indicator, GCaMP6f, to record calcium transients. A custom perfusion and imaging chamber for ex vivo murine globes was designed to maintain and stabilize the cornea, while allowing the introduction of chemical stimulation during imaging. Imaging of calcium signals in the ex vivo murine cornea was demonstrated. Strong calcium signals with minimal photobleaching were observed in experiments lasting up to 10 minutes. Concentrated potassium and lidocaine solutions both modulated corneal nerve activity. Similar responses were observed in the same neurons across multiple chemical stimulations, suggesting the feasibility of using chemical stimulations to test the response of the corneal nerves. Our studies suggest that this tool will be of great use for studying functional changes to corneal nerves in response to disease and ocular procedures. This process will enable preclinical testing of new ocular procedures to minimize damage to corneal innervation and therapies for diminished neural function.",

Recently, red and green genetically encoded sensors for DA (dLight, GRAB-DA) were developed and now provide the ability to track release dynamics at a subsecond resolution, with submicromolar affinity and high molecular specificity. Combined with rapid developments in in vivo imaging, these sensors have the potential to transform the field of DA sensing and DA-based drug discovery. When implementing these tools in the laboratory, it is important to consider there is not a 'one-size-fits-all' sensor. Sensor properties, most importantly their affinity and dynamic range, must be carefully chosen to match local DA levels. Molecular specificity, sensor kinetics, spectral properties, brightness, sensor scaffold and pharmacology can further influence sensor choice depending on the experimental question. In this review, we use DA as an example; we briefly summarize old and new techniques to monitor DA release, including DA biosensors. We then outline a map of DA heterogeneity across the brain and provide a guide for optimal sensor choice and implementation based on local DA levels and other experimental parameters.

However, the exploration of plant nanobiotechnology is still in its outset. The search for novel tools to monitor plant biomolecules is an emerging issue for the nanobiotechnologists. Given this, a genetically encoded FRET-based nanobiosensor has been developed to monitor the popular plant cardiac glycoside - digoxin, which is used as the most common prescription drug for heart-related illnesses across the world. Digoxin is sourced from the leaves of the foxglove plant (Digitalis purpurea L.) and has a significant demand in the medical sector. Moreover, with the rising popularity of the herbal formulations in the global market, attention towards the authentication and quality control of the herbal drugs is important. Furthermore, digoxin has a very narrow therapeutic range, i.e., 0.6 nM - 2.6 nM. Therefore, strict monitoring of blood digoxin levels is necessary. Besides, previously used techniques for drug authentication and quantification of small-molecule drugs in blood samples are not the best choice available. The nanobiosensor is based on the FRET (Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer) mechanism, and it is constructed in such a way that it gives a changed FRET output in the presence of digoxin. Two fluorophores, enhanced cyan fluorescent protein (ECFP) and Venus, were attached on either end of the sensory domain - human nuclear receptor ROR-gamma (RORγt). The developed nanobiosensor was named as fluorescent indicator protein for digoxin, (FLIP-digoxin). The ligand binding affinity of FLIP-digoxin was calculated as 425 μM. Affinity mutants of the FLIP-digoxin were also generated to measure digoxin in wide concentration ranges. This sensor offers high-throughput qualitative analysis of digoxin in Digitalis preparations procured from local drug stores. It confirms the authenticity of the preparations through the detection of digoxin. The FLIP-1n was also able to monitor digoxin concentration in serum samples in lesser than 5 min. The nanobiosensor was found pH stable, digoxin-specific, non- interfered by the biological serum species and can perform high throughput screening of the Digitalis powder, infusion and tincture preparations.",

        "abstract": "Understanding how the brain encodes and processes information requires the recording of neural activity that underlies different behaviors. Recent efforts in fluorescent protein engineering have succeeded in developing powerful tools for visualizing neural activity, in general by coupling neural activity to different properties of a fluorescent protein scaffold. Here, we take advantage of a previously unexploited class of reversibly switchable fluorescent proteins to engineer a new type of calcium sensor. We introduce rsCaMPARI, a genetically encoded calcium marker engineered from a reversibly switchable fluorescent protein that enables spatiotemporally precise marking, erasing, and remarking of active neuron populations under brief, user-defined time windows of light exposure. rsCaMPARI photoswitching kinetics are modulated by calcium concentration when illuminating with blue light, and the fluorescence can be reset with violet light. We demonstrate the utility of rsCaMPARI for marking and remarking active neuron populations in freely swimming zebrafish.",

Many fluorescent genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicators (GECIs) have been developed, but those with ratiometric readout seem more appropriate to image a moving organ such as the heart. Four ratiometric GECIs based on troponin C, TN-XXL, Twitch-1, Twitch-2B, and Twitch-4 were expressed transiently in the heart of zebrafish embryos. Their emission ratio reported the Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels in both the atrium and the ventricle. We measured several kinetic parameters of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients: systolic and diastolic ratio, the amplitude of the systolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> rise, the heart rate, as well as the rise and decay times and slopes. The systolic ratio change decreased in cells expressing high biosensor concentration, possibly caused by Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffering. The GECIs were able to report the effect of nifedipine and propranolol on the heart, which resulted in changes in heart rate, diastolic and systolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels, and Ca<sup>2+</sup> kinetics. As a result, Twitch-1 and Twitch-4 (<i>K</i>d 0.25 and 2.8 µM, respectively) seem the most promising GECIs for generating transgenic zebrafish lines, which could be used for modeling heart disorders, for drug screening, and for cardiotoxicity assessment during drug development.",

In addition, since biothiols such as glutathione (GSH, pK<sub>a</sub> 8.3), possessing similar chemical properties with Sec, commonly exist in living systems at high levels. Thus, it is of great importance and high challenge to identify novel probes for selectively monitoring Sec over biothiols. In this paper, we proposed a smart strategy which allowed us to develop a lysosome targetable probe for specifically sensing Sec. By restricting weak acidic microenvironment, the probe shows a specific detection for Sec with 85-fold fluorescence enhancement owing to the remaining high activity of Sec at pH 5.0. Moreover, being low cytotoxicity to the cells verified by MTS assay, the probe was then successfully applied for imaging exogenous and endogenous Sec in lysosomes, indicating its potential for the biological investigation of Sec in subcellular organelles.",

However, how neural activity underlying the sleep-wake cycle controls adenosine release in the brain remains unclear. Using a newly developed genetically encoded adenosine sensor, we found an activity-dependent rapid increase in the concentration of extracellular adenosine in mouse basal forebrain (BF), a critical region controlling sleep and wakefulness. Although the activity of both BF cholinergic and glutamatergic neurons correlated with changes in the concentration of adenosine, optogenetic activation of these neurons at physiological firing frequencies showed that glutamatergic neurons contributed much more to the adenosine increase. Mice with selective ablation of BF glutamatergic neurons exhibited a reduced adenosine increase and impaired sleep homeostasis regulation.

To visualize local connections, we previously developed a genetically encoded fluorescent indicator, GRAPHIC, which labels cell-cell contacts by restricting the reconstituted green fluorescent protein (GFP) signal to the contact site. Here, we modify GRAPHIC to give the reconstituted GFP motility within the membrane, to detect cells that make contact with other specific cells. Removal of leucine zipper domains, located between the split GFP fragment and glycophosphatidylinositol anchor domain, allowed GFP reconstituted at the contact site to diffuse throughout the entire plasma membrane, revealing cell morphology. Further, depending on the structural spacers employed, the reconstituted GFP could be selectively targeted to N terminal (NT)- or C terminal (CT)-probe-expressing cells. Using these novel constructs, we demonstrated that we can specifically label NT-probe-expressing cells that made contact with CT-probe-expressing cells in an epithelial cell culture and in Xenopus 8-cell-stage blastomeres. Moreover, we showed that diffusible GRAPHIC (dGRAPHIC) can be used in neuronal circuits to trace neurons that make contact to reveal a connection map. Finally, application in the developing brain demonstrated that the dGRAPHIC signal remained on neurons that had transient contacts during circuit development to reveal the contact history. Altogether, dGRAPHIC is a unique probe that can visualize cells that made specific cell-cell contact.",

Specific and efficacious genetically encoded biosensors have been developed to monitor cAMP fluctuations with high spatial and temporal resolution in living cells or tissue. A well characterized biosensor for cAMP is the Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based Epac1-camps protein. Pharmacological characterization of newly developed ligands acting at GPCRs often includes numerical quantification of the second messenger amount that was produced. To quantify cellular cAMP concentrations, we bacterially over-expressed and purified Epac1-camps and applied the purified protein in a cell-free detection assay for cAMP in a multi-well format. We found that the biosensor can detect as little as 0.15 pmol of cAMP, and that the sensitivity is not impaired by non-physiological salt concentrations or pH values. Notably, the assay tolerated desiccation and storage of the protein without affecting Epac1-camps cyclic nucleotide sensitivity. We found that determination cAMP in lysates obtained from cell assays or tissue samples by purified Epac1-camps is a robust, fast, and sensitive assay suitable for routine and high throughput analyses.",

        "abstract": "Intracellular calcium can be monitored by various calcium-specific fluorescent dyes including gene-encoded calcium indicators (GECI). GCaMP is a widely-used GECI that emits green fluorescence proportional to the level of intracellular calcium. However, since many tagging proteins also emit green fluorescence, GCaMP cannot be used with another green fluorescent protein. Therefore, it would be ideal to develop a GECI that has a distinct color profile other than green. In this regard, we developed a novel blue fluorescent calcium indicator modified from GCaMP called Ser<sup>222</sup>-Ala<sup>229</sup>-Cys<sup>330</sup>-BCaMP3. Specifically, a simple threonine to histidine substitution to a green fluorescent Cys<sup>330</sup>-GCaMP3 successfully changed its fluorescence to blue (Cys<sup>330</sup>-BCaMP3, B for blue). Furthermore, a couple of additional amino acid substitutions resulted in more enhanced blue fluorescence intensity. Among other Cys<sup>330</sup>-BCaMP3 variants, it was found that Ser<sup>222</sup>-Ala<sup>229</sup>-Cys<sup>330</sup>-BCaMP3 exhibited the strongest blue fluorescence intensity. When Ser<sup>222</sup>-Ala<sup>229</sup>-Cys<sup>330</sup>-BCaMP3 was co-expressed with TRPA1 - a non-selective cation channel - in HEK293T cells, it showed moderate blue fluorescence. One of the drawbacks of Ser<sup>222</sup>-Ala<sup>229</sup>-Cys<sup>330</sup>-BCaMP3 was that the fluorescence intensity was not enough when cells were cultured under 37°C. However, this limitation was circumvented by lowering cell culture temperature to 28°C, allowing much more enhanced blue fluorescence. Although Ser<sup>222</sup>-Ala<sup>229</sup>-Cys<sup>330</sup>-BCaMP3 mandates further optimization, the present study has found a promising blue fluorescent GECI that is derived from GCaMP3.",

We previously engineered genetically encoded red-shifted redox-sensitive fluorescent protein sensors using a Förster resonance energy transfer relay strategy. Here, we developed a second-generation excitation ratiometric sensor called rogRFP2 with improved red emission for quantitative live-cell imaging. Using this sensor to measure activity-dependent redox changes in individual cultured neurons, we observed an anticorrelation in which mitochondrial oxidation was accompanied by a concurrent reduction in the cytosol. This behavior was dependent on the activity of Complex I of the mitochondrial electron transport chain and could be modulated by the presence of cocultured astrocytes. We also demonstrated that the red fluorescent rogRFP2 facilitates ratiometric one- and two-photon redox imaging in rat brain slices and Drosophila retinas.

Geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP), and to a lesser extent other isoprenoid pyrophosphates, interfere with the binding of CrtR to its target DNA in vitro, suggesting they act as inducers of carotenoid biosynthesis. CrtR homologs are encoded in the genomes of many other actinobacteria. In order to determine if and to what extent the function of CrtR, as a metabolite-dependent transcriptional repressor of carotenoid biosynthesis genes responding to GGPP, is conserved among <i>actinobacteria</i>, five CrtR orthologs were characterized in more detail. EMSA assays showed that the CrtR orthologs from <i>Corynebacterium</i><i>callunae</i>, <i>Acidipropionibacterium</i><i>jensenii</i>, <i>Paenarthrobacter</i><i>nicotinovorans</i>, <i>Micrococcus</i><i>luteus</i> and <i>Pseudarthrobacter</i><i>chlorophenolicus</i> bound to the intergenic region between their own gene and the divergently oriented gene, and that GGPP inhibited these interactions.

Moreover, the CrtR orthologs functioned in <i>C. glutamicum</i> in vivo at least partially, as they complemented the defects in the pigmentation and expression of a P<i>crtE</i>_<i>gfp</i>uv transcriptional fusion that were observed in a <i>crtR</i> deletion mutant to varying degrees. Subsequently, the utility of the P<i>crtE</i>_<i>gfp</i>uv transcriptional fusion and chromosomally encoded CrtR from <i>C. glutamicum</i> as genetically encoded biosensor for GGPP was studied.

        "abstract": "To understand the role of intracellular metabolites in cellular processes, it is important to measure the dynamics and fluxes of small molecules in living cells. Although conventional metabolite sensors composed of fluorescent proteins have been made to detect some metabolites, an emerging approach is to use genetically encoded sensors composed of RNA. Because of the ability to rapidly generate metabolite-binding RNA aptamers, RNA-based sensors have the potential to be designed more readily than protein-based sensors. Numerous strategies have been developed to convert the green-fluorescent Spinach or Broccoli fluorogenic RNA aptamers into metabolite-regulated sensors. Nevertheless, red fluorescence is particularly desirable because of the low level of red background fluorescence in cells. However, the red fluorescent variant of the Broccoli aptamer, Red Broccoli, does not exhibit red fluorescence in cells when imaged with its cognate fluorophore. It is not known why Red Broccoli is fluorescent <i>in vitro</i> but not in live mammalian cells. Here, we develop a new fluorophore, OBI (3,5-difluoro-4-hydroxybenzylidene-imidazolinone-2-oxime-1-benzoimidazole), which binds Red Broccoli with high affinity and makes Red Broccoli resistant to thermal unfolding. We show that OBI enables Red Broccoli to be readily detected in live mammalian cells.

        "abstract": "In yeast, adaptation to varying conditions often requires proper regulation of the plasma membrane potential. To determine yeast membrane potential change, optical methods involving potentiometric dyes have been supplemental to the direct electrode-based method. However, the hydrophobic nature of the dyes and their slow distribution across the membrane still limits their utilization. Genetically encoded voltage indicator (GEVI) proteins employed in neuroscience offer a tantalizing alternative for monitoring yeast membrane potential change. In this work, several widely used GEVI proteins were assessed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae for their expression and function as a voltage reporter. Among them, only ArcLight and Accelerated Sensor of Action Potential (ASAP) proteins could be expressed and transported to the plasma membrane. While the voltage-sensing capability was demonstrated for both ArcLight and ASAP, ArcLight fluorescence was sensitive to the intracellular pH change concurrently with the voltage change. Therefore, we established that ASAP is the more suitable GEVI protein for reporting yeast membrane potential change. This voltage-sensing reporter for yeast based on ASAP offers a new effective strategy for real-time optical detection of yeast membrane potential change, which potentially facilitates many areas of yeast research including optimizing growth conditions for industrial use and investigating yeast ion transport system.",

        "abstract": "Changes in transcellular bioelectrical patterns are known to play important roles during developmental and regenerative processes. The Drosophila follicular epithelium has proven to be an appropriate model system for studying the mechanisms by which bioelectrical signals emerge and act. Fluorescent indicator dyes in combination with various inhibitors of ion-transport mechanisms have been used to investigate the generation of membrane potentials (V<sub>mem</sub>) and intracellular pH (pH<sub>i</sub>). Both parameters as well as their anteroposterior and dorsoventral gradients were affected by the inhibitors which, in addition, led to alterations of microfilament and microtubule patterns equivalent to those observed during follicle-cell differentiation. We expressed two genetically-encoded fluorescent sensors for V<sub>mem</sub> and pH<sub>i</sub>, ArcLight and pHluorin-Moesin, in the follicular epithelium of Drosophila. By means of the respective inhibitors, we obtained comparable effects on V<sub>mem</sub> and/or pH<sub>i</sub> as previously described for V<sub>mem</sub>- and pH<sub>i</sub>-sensitive fluorescent dyes. In a RNAi-knockdown screen, five genes of ion-transport mechanisms and gap-junction subunits were identified exerting influence on ovary development and/or oogenesis. Loss of ovaries or small ovaries were the results of soma knockdowns of the innexins inx1 and inx3, and of the DEG/ENaC family member ripped pocket (rpk). Germline knockdown of rpk also resulted in smaller ovaries. Soma knockdown of the V-ATPase-subunit vha55 caused size-reduced ovaries with degenerating follicles from stage 10A onward. In addition, soma knockdown of the open rectifier K<sup>+</sup>channel 1 (ork1) resulted in a characteristic round-egg phenotype with altered microfilament and microtubule organisation in the follicular epithelium. The genetic tool box of Drosophila provides means for a refined and extended analysis of bioelectrical phenomena. Tissue-specifically expressed V<sub>mem</sub>- and pH<sub>i</sub>-sensors exhibit some practical advantages compared to fluorescent indicator dyes. Their use confirms that the ion-transport mechanisms targeted by inhibitors play important roles in the generation of bioelectrical signals. Moreover, modulation of bioelectrical signals via RNAi-knockdown of genes coding for ion-transport mechanisms and gap-junction subunits exerts influence on crucial processes during ovary development and results in cytoskeletal changes and altered follicle shape. Thus, further evidence amounts for bioelectrical regulation of developmental processes via the control of both signalling pathways and cytoskeletal organisation.",

Current approaches do not allow detection of the lactate/pyruvate ratio in a single readout with high spatial/temporal resolution in living systems. Using a Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based screening strategy, we found that the orphan transcriptional factor <i>LutR</i> from <i>Bacillus licheniformis</i> is an endogenous sensor of the lactate/pyruvate ratio, suitable for use as a binding moiety to develop a lactate/pyruvate ratio FRET-based genetically encoded indicator, Lapronic. The sensitivity of the indicator to lactate and pyruvate was characterized through changes in the fluorescence FRET ratio and validated with isothermal titration calorimetry. Lapronic was insensitive to physiological pH and temperature and did not respond to structurally related molecules acetate and β-hydroxybutyrate or cofactors NAD<sup>+</sup> and NADH. Lapronic was expressed in HEK 293 cells showing a homogeneous cytosolic localization and was also targeted to the mitochondrial matrix. A calibration protocol was designed to quantitatively assess the lactate/pyruvate ratio in intact mammalian cells.

Little is known about whether and how Orai1 channel activity may vary between individual puncta. Previously, we developed and validated optical recording of Orai channel activity, using genetically encoded Ca2+ indicators fused to Orai1 or Orai3 N or C termini. We have now combined total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy with whole-cell recording to map functional properties of channels at individual puncta. After Ca2+ store depletion in HEK cells cotransfected with mCherry-STIM1 and Orai1-GCaMP6f, Orai1-GCaMP6f fluorescence increased progressively with increasingly negative test potentials and robust responses could be recorded from individual puncta. Cell-wide fluorescence half-rise and -fall times during steps to -100 mV test potential indicated probe response times of <50 ms. The in situ Orai1-GCaMP6f affinity for Ca2+ was 620 nM, assessed by monitoring fluorescence using buffered Ca2+ solutions in \"unroofed\" cells. Channel activity and temporal activation profile were tracked in individual puncta using image maps and automated puncta identification and recording. Simultaneous measurement of mCherry-STIM1 fluorescence uncovered an unexpected gradient in STIM1/Orai1 ratio that extends across the cell surface. Orai1-GCaMP6f channel activity was found to vary across the cell, with inactive channels occurring in the corners of cells where the STIM1/Orai1 ratio was lowest; low-activity channels typically at edges displayed a slow activation phase lasting hundreds of milliseconds. Puncta with high STIM1/Orai1 ratios exhibited a range of channel activity that appeared unrelated to the stoichiometric requirements for gating. These findings demonstrate functional heterogeneity of Orai1 channel activity between individual puncta and establish a new experimental platform that facilitates systematic comparisons between puncta composition and activity.",

To date, little is known on the behaviour of individual hypoxic tumour cells in their microenvironment. To explore this issue in a spatial and temporally controlled manner, we developed a genetically encoded sensor by fusing the O<sub>2</sub>-labile hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) protein to eGFP and a tamoxifen-regulated Cre recombinase. Under normoxic conditions, HIF-1α is degraded but, under hypoxia, the HIF-1α-GFP-Cre-ER<sup>T2</sup> fusion protein is stabilised and in the presence of tamoxifen activates a tdTomato reporter gene that is constitutively expressed in hypoxic progeny. We visualise the random distribution of hypoxic tumour cells from hypoxic or necrotic regions and vascularised areas using immunofluorescence and intravital microscopy. Once tdTomato expression is induced, it is stable for at least 4 weeks. Using this system, we could show <i>in vivo</i> that the post-hypoxic cells were more proliferative than non-labelled cells. Our results demonstrate that single-cell lineage tracing of hypoxic tumour cells can allow visualisation of their behaviour in living tumours using intravital microscopy.

In an effort to sustain the steady progression toward ever-improved GECIs, we undertook the development of a new GECI based on the bright monomeric GFP, mNeonGreen (mNG). The resulting indicator, mNG-GECO1, is 60% brighter than GCaMP6s in vitro and provides comparable performance as demonstrated by imaging Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics in cultured cells, primary neurons, and in vivo in larval zebrafish.

Today, major efforts are devoted toward optimizing red-emitting [red fluorescent protein (RFP)-based] GECIs (R-GECI), as these provide several advantages over GFP-based reporters, for instance, increased imaging depth, reduced photodamage by longer imaging wavelengths and, in principle, are better suited for use with prevalent blue-absorbing optogenetic tools (e.g., channelrhodopsin). However, excessive fluorescence from intersecting neighboring cells in very dense tissues, notably the brain, hinders the ability to collect signals from single cells and their processes. This challenge can be addressed by photoactivatable (PA) fluorescent proteins that can be rendered fluorescent <i>on demand</i> by user-defined targeted light. This allows activation and, thereby, collection of fluorescent signals exclusively from desired cells and their processes, while leaving all neighboring cells in the dark (i.e., non-fluorescent). Nevertheless, there are no PA R-GECIs. Here, we sought to develop PA-R-GECIs. To do so, we initially explored a recently discovered phenomenon of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent increases in fluorescence (i.e., artifacts) in an emerging R-GECI, which has led us to rationally engineer several functional PA-R-GECIs.

        "abstract": "Linking neural circuitry to behavior by mapping active neurons <i>in vivo</i> is a challenge. Both genetically encoded calcium indicators (GECIs) and intermediate early genes (IEGs) have been used to pinpoint active neurons during a stimulus or behavior but have drawbacks such as limiting the movement of the organism, requiring <i>a priori</i> knowledge of the active region or having poor temporal resolution. Calcium-modulated photoactivatable ratiometric integrator (CaMPARI) was engineered to overcome these spatial-temporal challenges. CaMPARI is a photoconvertible protein that only converts from green to red fluorescence in the presence of high calcium concentration and 405 nm light. This allows the experimenter to precisely mark active neurons within defined temporal windows. The photoconversion can then be quantified by taking the ratio of the red fluorescence to the green. CaMPARI promises the ability to trace active neurons during a specific stimulus; however, CaMPARI's uses in adult <i>Drosophila</i> have been limited to photoconversion during fly immobilization. Here, we demonstrate a method that allows photoconversion of multiple freely-moving intact adult flies during a stimulus. Flies were placed in a dish with filter paper wet with acetic acid (pH = 2) or neutralized acetic acid (pH = 7) and exposed to photoconvertible light (60 mW) for 30 min (500 ms on, 200 ms off). Immediately following photoconversion, whole flies were fixed and imaged by confocal microscopy. The red:green ratio was quantified for the DC4 glomerulus, a bundle of neurons expressing <i>Ir64a</i>, an ionotropic receptor that senses acids in the <i>Drosophila</i> antennal lobe. Flies exposed to acetic acid showed 1.3-fold greater photoconversion than flies exposed to neutralized acetic acid. This finding was recapitulated using a more physiological stimulus of apple cider vinegar. These results indicate that CaMPARI can be used to label neurons in intact, freely-moving adult flies and will be useful for identifying the circuitry underlying complex behaviors.",

Although previous studies demonstrated the potential for using 7-HCAA as an acceptor for tryptophan, this approach has not yet been explored within a single protein containing multiple tryptophan residues. A structure-based analysis of a hexokinase enzyme with multiple native tryptophan residues identified glutamate 50 as a potential site of 7-HCAA incorporation; Glu50 moves closer to the native tryptophans upon substrate binding. Substitution of 7-HCAA at residue 50 led to an increase in FRET efficiency in the presence of the substrate; this effect was not observed in a control protein where no change in distance between 7-HCAA and the native tryptophans occurs on substrate binding. This system was then used to directly observe differences in binding affinity of the hexokinase that occur at a number of pH values. Our approach builds on previous research in that it eliminates the need for the incorporation of multiple fNCAAs or fluorescent labels within a target protein and can be used to study substrate binding with native ligands. As such, it serves to expand the versatility of FRET-based techniques.",

Genetically encoded RNA-based sensors are emerging powerful tools for this purpose. However, it was challenging to use these sensors to precisely determine the intracellular concentrations of target analytes. To solve this problem, we have recently developed ratiometric sensors using an orthogonal pair of RNA/fluorophore conjugates: Broccoli/DFHBI-1T (3,5-difluoro-4-hydroxybenzylidene-1-trifluoroethyl-imidazolinone) and DNB (dinitroaniline-binding aptamer)/SR-DN (sulforhodamine B-dinitroaniline).

Unfortunately, due to the instability of the SR-DN dye, this ratiometric sensor is difficult to use for monitoring target dynamics. Herein, by replacing SR-DN with a stable TMR (tetramethylrhodamine)-DN dye, we developed a ratiometric sensor system based on Broccoli/DFHBI-1T and DNB/TMR-DN, which can be used for dynamic imaging in living cells.

Mechanistically, STAT3 transactivated MDH1 to sustain the malate-aspartate NADH shuttle activity and HSC self-renewal and differentiation. We reveal an unexpected metabolic program of FL-HSCs and provide a powerful genetic tool for metabolic studies of HSCs or other types of stem cells.",

Here, we report development of a method combining genetically encoded fluorescent sensors with high-resolution imaging and analysis algorithms which permits the first direct visualization of neuromodulatory transmitter diffusion at various neuronal and non-neuronal cells. Our analysis reveals that acetylcholine and monoamines diffuse at individual release sites with a spread length constant of ∼0.75 μm. These transmitters employ varied numbers of release sites, and when spatially close-packed release sites coactivate they can spillover into larger subcellular areas. Our data indicate spatially restricted (i.e., nonvolume) neuromodulatory transmission to be a prominent intercellular communication mode, reshaping current thinking of control and precision of neuromodulation crucial for understanding behaviors and diseases.",

        "abstract": "Genetically encoded calcium indicators (GECIs) have become a widespread tool for the visualization of neuronal activity. As compared to popular GCaMP GECIs, the FGCaMP indicator benefits from calmodulin and M13-peptide from the fungi <i>Aspergillus niger</i> and <i>Aspergillus fumigatus</i>, which prevent its interaction with the intracellular environment. However, FGCaMP exhibits a two-phase fluorescence behavior with the variation of calcium ion concentration, has moderate sensitivity in neurons (as compared to the GCaMP6s indicator), and has not been fully characterized in vitro and in vivo. To address these limitations, we developed an enhanced version of FGCaMP, called FGCaMP7. FGCaMP7 preserves the ratiometric phenotype of FGCaMP, with a 3.1-fold larger ratiometric dynamic range in vitro. FGCaMP7 demonstrates 2.7- and 8.7-fold greater photostability compared to mEGFP and mTagBFP2 fluorescent proteins in vitro, respectively. The ratiometric response of FGCaMP7 is 1.6- and 1.4-fold higher, compared to the intensiometric response of GCaMP6s, in non-stimulated and stimulated neuronal cultures, respectively. We reveal the inertness of FGCaMP7 to the intracellular environment of HeLa cells using its truncated version with a deleted M13-like peptide; in contrast to the similarly truncated variant of GCaMP6s. We characterize the crystal structure of the parental FGCaMP indicator. Finally, we test the in vivo performance of FGCaMP7 in mouse brain using a two-photon microscope and an NVista miniscope; and in zebrafish using two-color ratiometric confocal imaging.",

When expressed in CMs, Archon1 demonstrated fast kinetics comparable with patch-clamp electrophysiology and high SNR significantly greater than the VSD Di-8-ANEPPS.

For the control and regulation of sulfate in a metabolic network through fluxomics, a non-invasive tool is highly desirable that opens the door to monitor the level of the sulfate in real time and space in living cells without fractionation of the cells or tissue. Here, we engineered a FRET (fluorescence resonance energy transfer) based sensor for sulfate, which is genetically-encoded and named as FLIP-SP (Fluorescent indicator protein for sulfate). The FLIP-SP can measure the level of the sulfate in live cells. This sensor was constructed by the fusion of fluorescent proteins at the N- and C-terminus of sulfate binding protein (sbp). The FLIP-SP is highly specific to sulfate, and showed pH stability. Real-time monitoring of the level of sulfate in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells showed sensor bio-compatibility with living cells.

        "abstract": "(+)-Catechin is an important antioxidant of green tea (<i>Camelia sinensis</i> (L.) O. Kuntze). Catechin is known for its positive role in anticancerous activity, extracellular matrix degradation, cell death regulation, diabetes, and other related disorders. As a result of enormous interest in and great demand for catechin, its biosynthesis using metabolic engineering has become the subject of concentrated research with the aim of enhancing (+)-catechin production. Metabolic flux is an essential concept in the practice of metabolic engineering as it helps in the identification of the regulatory element of a biosynthetic pathway. In the present study, an attempt was made to analyze the metabolic flux of the (+)-catechin biosynthesis pathway in order to decipher the regulatory element of this pathway. Firstly, a genetically encoded fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based nanosensor (FLIP-Cat, fluorescence indicator protein for (+)-catechin) was developed for real-time monitoring of (+)-catechin flux. <i>In vitro</i> characterization of the purified protein of the nanosensor showed that the nanosensor was pH stable and (+)-catechin specific. Its calculated <i>K</i><sub>d</sub> was 139 µM. The nanosensor also performed real-time monitoring of (+)-catechin in bacterial cells. In the second step of this study, an entire (+)-catechin biosynthesis pathway was constructed and expressed in <i>E. coli</i> in two sets of plasmid constructs: pET26b-PT7-rbs-PAL-PT7-rbs-4CL-PT7-rbs-CHS-PT7-rbs-CHI and pET26b-T7-rbs-F3H-PT7-rbs- DFR-PT7-rbs-LCR. The <i>E. coli</i> harboring the FLIP-Cat was transformed with these plasmid constructs. The metabolic flux analysis of (+)-catechin was carried out using the FLIP-Cat. The FLIP-Cat successfully monitored the flux of catechin after adding tyrosine, 4-coumaric acid, 4-coumaroyl CoA, naringenin chalcone, naringenin, dihydroquercetin, and leucocyanidin, individually, with the bacterial cells expressing the nanosensor as well as the genes of the (+)-catechin biosynthesis pathway. Dihydroflavonol reductase (DFR) was identified as the main regulatory element of the (+)-catechin biosynthesis pathway. Information about this regulatory element of the (+)-catechin biosynthesis pathway can be used for manipulating the (+)-catechin biosynthesis pathway using a metabolic engineering approach to enhance production of (+)-catechin.",

        "abstract": "Synapses are highly compartmentalized functional units that operate independently on each other. In Huntington's disease (HD) and other neurodegenerative disorders, this independence might be compromised due to insufficient glutamate clearance and the resulting spill-in and spill-out effects. Altered astrocytic coverage of the presynaptic terminals and/or dendritic spines as well as a reduced size of glutamate transporter clusters at glutamate release sites have been implicated in the pathogenesis of diseases resulting in symptoms of dys-/hyperkinesia. However, the mechanisms leading to the dysfunction of glutamatergic synapses in HD are not well understood. Improving and applying synapse imaging we have obtained data shedding new light on the mechanisms impeding the initiation of movements. Here, we describe the principle elements of a relatively inexpensive approach to achieve single synapse resolution by using the new genetically encoded ultrafast glutamate sensor iGluu, wide-field optics, a scientific CMOS (sCMOS) camera, a 473 nm laser and a laser positioning system to evaluate the state of corticostriatal synapses in acute slices from age appropriate healthy or diseased mice. Glutamate transients were constructed from single or multiple pixels to obtain estimates of i) glutamate release based on the maximal elevation of the glutamate concentration [Glu] next to the active zone and ii) glutamate uptake as reflected in the time constant of decay (TauD) of the perisynaptic [Glu]. Differences in the resting bouton size and contrasting patterns of short-term plasticity served as criteria for the identification of corticostriatal terminals as belonging to the intratelencephalic (IT) or the pyramidal tract (PT) pathway. Using these methods, we discovered that in symptomatic HD mice ~40% of PT-type corticostriatal synapses exhibited insufficient glutamate clearance, suggesting that these synapses might be at risk to excitotoxic damage. The results underline the usefulness of TauD as a biomarker of dysfunctional synapses in Huntington mice with a hypokinetic phenotype.",

Measuring the blood lead level (BLL) is the only way to officially evaluate the degree of exposure to lead. The so-called \"safe value\" of the BLL seems to unreliably represent the secure threshold for children. In general, lead's underlying toxicological mechanism remains unclear and needs to be elucidated. Therefore, we developed a novel genetically encoded fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based lead biosensor, Met-lead, and applied it to transgenic Drosophila to perform further investigations. We combined Met-lead with the <i>UAS-GAL4</i> system to the sensor protein specifically expressed within certain regions of fly brains. Using a suitable imaging platform, including a fast epifluorescent or confocal laser-scanning/two-photon microscope with high resolution, we recorded the changes in lead content inside fly brains ex vivo and in vivo and at different life stages. The blood-brain barrier was found to play an important role in the protection of neurons in the brain against damage due to the heavy metal lead, either through food or microinjection into the abdomen. Met-lead has the potential to be a powerful tool for the sensing of lead within living organisms by employing either a fast epi-FRET microscope or high-resolution brain imaging.",

The classical Hebbian paradigm of synaptic memory, long-term potentiation (LTP) of transmission, has been widely associated with an increase in the postsynaptic receptor current. Whether and to what degree LTP induction also enhances presynaptic glutamate release has been the subject of debate. Here, we took advantage of the recently developed genetically encoded optical sensors of glutamate (iGluSnFR) to monitor its release at CA3-CA1 synapses in acute hippocampal slices, before and after the induction of LTP. We attempted to trace release events at multiple synapses simultaneously, by using two-photon excitation imaging in fast frame-scanning mode. We thus detected a significant increase in the average iGluSnFR signal during potentiation, which lasted for up to 90 min. This increase may reflect an increased amount of released glutamate or, alternatively, reduced glutamate binding to high-affinity glutamate transporters that compete with iGluSnFR.",

We therefore expressed a low affinity Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator (ER-GCaMP6-150) in the ER, and measured its fluorescence both in dissociated ommatidia and <i>in vivo</i> from intact flies of both sexes. Blue excitation light induced a rapid (tau ∼0.8 s), PLC-dependent decrease in fluorescence, representing depletion of ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores, followed by a slower decay, typically reaching ∼50% of initial dark-adapted levels, with significant depletion occurring under natural levels of illumination. The ER stores refilled in the dark within 100-200 s. Both rapid and slow store depletion were largely unaffected in InsP<sub>3</sub> receptor mutants, but were much reduced in <i>trp</i> mutants. Strikingly, rapid (but not slow) depletion of ER stores was blocked by removing external Na<sup>+</sup> and in mutants of the Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchanger, CalX, which we immuno-localized to ER membranes in addition to its established localization in the plasma membrane.

Primary transgenic endothelial cells stimulated by ATP showed a definite and short influx of Ca<sup>2+</sup> into the cytosol, whereas exposure to human serum resulted in a more intense and sustained response. Surprisingly, not all endothelial cells reacted identically to a stimulus, rather activation took place in adjacent cells in a timely decelerated way and with distinct intensities.

Finally, we show clear evidence that antibody binding alone significantly activated endothelial cells, whereas antibody depletion dramatically reduced the stimulatory potential of serum.

        "abstract": "The kinetics/dynamics of signaling are of increasing value for G-protein-coupled receptor therapeutic development, including spatiotemporal signaling and the kinetic context of biased agonism. Effective application of signaling kinetics to developing new therapeutics requires reliable kinetic assays and an analysis framework to extract kinetic pharmacological parameters. Here we describe a platform for measuring arrestin recruitment kinetics to GPCRs using a high quantum yield, genetically encoded fluorescent biosensor, and a data analysis framework to quantify the recruitment kinetics. The sensor enabled high temporal resolution measurement of arrestin recruitment to the angiotensin AT<sub>1</sub> and vasopressin V<sub>2</sub> receptors. The analysis quantified the initial rate of arrestin recruitment (k<sub>τ</sub>), a biologically-meaningful kinetic drug efficacy parameter, by fitting time course data using routine curve-fitting methods. Biased agonism was assessed by comparing k<sub>τ</sub> values for arrestin recruitment with those for Gq signaling via the AT<sub>1</sub> receptor. The k<sub>τ</sub> ratio values were in good agreement with bias estimates from existing methods. This platform potentially improves and simplifies assessment of biased agonism because the same assay modality is used to compare pathways (potentially in the same cells), the analysis method is parsimonious and intuitive, and kinetic context is factored into the bias measurement.",

        "abstract": "An FcεRI-IgE-based genetically encoded microfluidic cell sensor was constructed for fast Gram-negative bacterial screening in food samples. CD14-Fcε IgE, produced by the gene engineered antibodies (GEAs) technology, was used for the recognition of the target bacteria or lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Stable cell lines expressing GCaMP6s, a genetically encoded indicator of calcium flux, were first established for monitoring mast cell activation and improving detection sensitivity. The microfluidic system was designed to improve automation and control the reaction time. Once Gram-negative bacteria bound to the CD14-Fcε IgE on the RBL-2H3 cell surface, RBL-2H3 cell receptor (FcεRI)-induced Ca2+ signaling pathway was immediately activated to release Ca2+. The elevated intracellular Ca2+ triggers GCaMP6s for reporting the presence of Gram-negative bacteria. The developed biosensor was able to detect 80 CFU mL-1 Gram-negative bacteria within 2.5 min in pure culture samples. The biosensor was used to detect Gram-negative bacteria in pork samples. With its short screening time and easy operation, the proposed biosensor shows promise in future applications of foodborne pathogen testing in 1 h to 1 day.",

Knowledge of the cellular energy states and the underlying regulatory mechanisms is therefore key to understanding cell physiology and to design therapeutic interventions. Cellular energy states are characterised by concentration ratios of adenylates, in particular ATP:ADP and ATP:AMP. We applied synthetic biology approaches to design, engineer and validate a genetically encoded nano-sensor for cellular energy state, AMPfret. It employs the naturally evolved energy sensing of eukaryotic cells provided by the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Our synthetic nano-sensor relies on fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) to detect changes in ATP:ADP and ATP:AMP ratios both in vitro and in cells in vivo. Construction and iterative optimisation relied on ACEMBL, a parallelised DNA assembly and construct screening technology we developed, facilitated by a method we termed tandem recombineering (TR). Our approach allowed rapid testing of numerous permutations of the AMPfret sensor to identify the most sensitive construct, which we characterised and validated both in the test tube and within cells.",

Here we present a sensing platform, termed proximity-activated imaging reporter (PAIR), which combines activity-based methionine bioconjugation and antibody labeling with proximity-dependent oligonucleotide-based amplification to monitor dynamic changes of a given analyte in cells and animals through context-dependent methionine labeling of specific protein targets. We establish this PAIR method to develop sensors for imaging reactive oxygen species (ROS) and calcium ions through oxaziridine-directed labeling of reactive methionine residues on β-actin and calmodulin (CaM), respectively, where the extent of methionine bioconjugation on these protein targets can serve as an indicator of oxidative stress or calcium status. In particular, application of PAIR to activity-based CaM detection provides a method for imaging integrated calcium activity in both in vitro cell and in vivo zebrafish models. By relying on native protein biochemistry, PAIR enables redox and metal imaging without introduction of external small molecules or genetically encoded indicators that can potentially buffer the natural/existing pools. This approach can be potentially generalized to target a broader range of analytes by pairing appropriate activity-based protein probes with protein detection reagents in a proximity-driven manner, providing a starting point not only for designing new sensors but also for monitoring endogenous activity of specific protein targets in biological specimens with spatial and temporal fidelity.",

However, our current understanding of physiological and pathological GSH changes at high spatial and temporal resolution is limited due to non-availability of practicable GSH-detection methods. In order to measure GSH at real-time, a ratiometric genetically encoded nanosensor was developed using fluorescent proteins and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) approach. The construction of the sensor involved the introduction of GSH binding protein (YliB) as a sensory domain between cyan fluorescent protein (CFP; FRET donor) and yellow fluorescent protein (YFP; FRET acceptor). The developed sensor, named as FLIP-G (Fluorescence Indicator Protein for Glutathione) was able to measure the GSH level under in vitro and in vivo conditions. When the purified FLIP-G was titrated with different concentrations of GSH, the FRET ratio increased with increase in GSH-concentration. The sensor was found to be specific for GSH and also stable to changes in pH. Moreover, in live bacterial cells, the constructed sensor enabled the real-time quantification of cytosolic GSH that is controlled by the oxidative stress level. When expressed in yeast cells, FRET ratio increased with the external supply of GSH to living cells. Therefore, as a valuable tool, the developed FLIP-G can monitor GSH level in living cells and also help in gaining new insights into GSH metabolism.",

The Cys-FS is pH stable, specific to cysteine and has an affinity of 1.2 × 10<sup>-</sup><sup>5</sup> M. A range of affinity mutants were also developed with a cumulative cysteine detection range from 800 nM to 3.5 mM. The Cys-FS nanosensor was expressed in bacterial, yeast and mammalian cells, and the dynamics of cysteine level was measured in living cells using the confocal microscopy. The results showed that the Cys-FS nanosensor successfully monitored the dynamics of cysteine in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems without disrupting the cell. Thus, this study presents a novel nanosensor that can measure cysteine in living cells. This nanosensor is minimally invasive and non-toxic.",

To pair the speed and sensitivity of chemically synthesized fluorescent indicators with cell-type specific genetic methods, we here develop Rhodamine-based Voltage Reporters (RhoVR) that can be covalently tethered to genetically encoded, self-labeling enzymes. These chemical-genetic hybrids feature a photoinduced electron transfer triggered RhoVR voltage-sensitive indicator coupled to a chloroalkane HaloTag ligand through a long, water-soluble polyethylene glycol linker (RhoVR-Halo). When applied to cells, RhoVR-Halo dyes selectively and covalently bind to surface-expressed HaloTag enzyme on genetically modified cells. RhoVR-Halo dyes maintain high voltage sensitivities-up to 34% Δ<i>F</i>/<i>F</i> per 100 mV-and fast response times typical of untargeted RhoVRs, while gaining the selectivity of genetically encodable voltage indicators. We show that RhoVR-Halos can record action potentials in single trials from cultured rat hippocampal neurons and can be used in concert with green-fluorescent Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicators like GCaMP to provide simultaneous voltage and Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging. In a brain slice, RhoVR-Halos provide exquisite labeling of defined cells and can be imaged using epifluorescence, confocal, or two-photon microscopy. Using high-speed epifluorescence microscopy, RhoVR-Halos provide a read-out of action potentials from labeled cortical neurons in a rat brain slice, without the need for trial averaging.

Here, we report the use of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 nuclease technique to develop a hiPSC line stably expressing ArcLight from the AAVS1 safe harbor locus. The hiPSC line retained proliferative ability with a growth rate similar to its parental strain. Optical recording with conventional epifluorescence microscopy allowed the detection of APs as early as 21 days postdifferentiation, and could be repeatedly monitored for at least 5 months. Moreover, quantification and analysis of the APs of ArcLight-CMs identified two distinctive subtypes: a group with high frequency of spontaneous APs of small amplitudes that were pacemaker-like CMs and a group with low frequency of automaticity and large amplitudes that resembled the working CMs. Compared with FluoVolt voltage-sensitive dye, although dimmer, the ArcLight reporter exhibited better optical performance in terms of phototoxicity and photostability with comparable sensitivities and signal-to-noise ratios.

We report a fluorescent probe cellular binding assay (FPCBA) for determination of these values for native (untagged) proteins overexpressed in living cells. This method uses fluorophores such as Pacific Blue (PB) linked to cell-permeable protein ligands to generate probes that rapidly and reversibly equilibrate with intracellular targets, as established by kinetic assays of cellular uptake and efflux. To analyze binding to untagged proteins, an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) vector was employed that allows a single mRNA to encode both the protein target and a separate orthogonal fluorescent protein (mVenus). This enabled cellular uptake of the probe to be correlated with protein expression by flow cytometry, allowing measurement of cellular dissociation constants (<i>K</i><sub>d</sub>) of the probe. This approach was validated by studies of the binding of allosteric activators to eight different Protein Kinase C (PKC) isozymes. Full-length PKCs expressed in transiently transfected HEK293T cells were used to measure cellular <i>K</i><sub>d</sub> values of a probe comprising PB linked to the natural product phorbol via a carbamate.

The pro-cell death signaling, apoptosis, and survival singling, autophagy work in an integrated manner for maintaining cell integrity. Their altered balance drives pathological conditions such as cancer, inflammatory disorders, and neurodegenerative diseases. Dissecting complex crosstalk between autophagy and apoptosis requires simultaneous detection of both events at a single cell level with good temporal resolution in real-time. Here, we have used two distinct fluorescent-based probes of caspase activation and autophagy for generating such sensor cells. Cells stably expressing RFP-LC3 as an autophagy marker were further stably expressed with a FRET-based probe for caspase activation with a nuclear localization signal. The functional validation and live-cell imaging of the sensor cells using selected treatments revealed that stress that induces rapid cell death often fails to induce autophagy signaling, and slow cell death induction triggers simultaneous autophagy signaling with caspase activation. The real-time imaging revealed the time-dependent shift of cells towards caspase activation while autophagy is inhibited confirming basal autophagy confers survival against apoptosis under stress conditions. Confocal imaging also revealed that cells under 3D culture condition maintain increased autophagy over monolayer cultures. High-throughput adaptability of the system extends its application for the screening of compounds that cause caspase activation, autophagy, or both demonstrating the potential utility of the sensor probe for diverse biological applications.",

In PPI analysis, methods using the sensor chips are widely employed to obtain quantitative data. However, these methods require that the target proteins be immobilized on the sensor chips, and the immobilization processes can affect the binding of the target proteins to their binding partners. In the present work, we propose a PPI analysis system in which the surface of the living cells is utilized as a sensing platform. In our approach, the target protein is displayed on the cell surface by expressing it as a fusion protein with a membrane protein, and the PPI analysis is then conducted by applying its binding partner labeled with a fluorescent dye to the cell surface. We have constructed a model of this binding analysis system using the interaction between biotin protein ligase (BPL) and biotin carboxyl carrier protein (BCCP), where BCCP was displayed on the cell surface and BPL labeled with fluorescein was applied to the cell surface. Here, a red fluorescent protein, mApple, was attached to the C-terminus of the fusion protein of BCCP with a membrane protein. We evaluated the binding level of the labeled BPL by using the intensity ratios of fluorescence from fluorescein to that from mApple. We found that the binding level of the labeled BPL was stably evaluated at least across 60 min observation period and estimated the binding dissociation constant between BPL and BCCP by equilibrium analysis to be 0.33 ± 0.05 μM.",

High mitochondrial temperature was maintained in the face of a variety of metabolic stresses, including substrate starvation or modification, decreased ATP demand due to inhibition of cytosolic protein synthesis, inhibition of the mitochondrial adenine nucleotide transporter and, if an auxiliary pathway for electron transfer was available via the alternative oxidase, even respiratory poisons acting downstream of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complex I.

The genetically encoded sensor, GRAB<sub>eCB2.0</sub>, detects real-time changes in eCB levels in cells in culture and preclinical model systems; however, its activation by eCB analogues produced by cells and by phyto-CBs remains uncharacterized, a current limitation when interpreting changes in its response. This information could provide additional utility for the tool in <i>in vivo</i> pharmacology studies of phyto-CB action. <b>Materials and Methods:</b> GRAB<sub>eCB2.0</sub> was expressed in cultured HEK293 cells. Live cell confocal microscopy and high-throughput fluorescent signal measurements. <b>Results:</b> 2-AG increased GRAB<sub>eCB2.0</sub> fluorescent signal (EC<sub>50</sub>=85 nM), and the cannabinoid 1 receptor (CB<sub>1</sub>R) antagonist, SR141716 (SR1), decreased GRAB<sub>eCB2.0</sub> signal (IC<sub>50</sub>=3.3 nM), responses that mirror their known potencies at the CB<sub>1</sub>R. GRAB<sub>eCB2.0</sub> fluorescent signal also increased in response to AEA (EC<sub>50</sub>=815 nM), the eCB analogues 2-linoleoylglycerol and 2-oleoylglycerol (EC<sub>50</sub>=632 and 868 nM, respectively), Δ<sup>9</sup>-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ<sup>9</sup>-THC), and Δ<sup>8</sup>-THC (EC<sub>50</sub>=1.6 and 2.0 μM, respectively), and the artificial CB<sub>1</sub>R agonist, CP55,940 (CP; EC<sub>50</sub>=82 nM); however their potencies were less than what has been described at CB<sub>1</sub>R. Cannabidiol (CBD) did not affect basal GRAB<sub>eCB2.0</sub> fluorescent signal and yet reduced the 2-AG stimulated GRAB<sub>eCB2.0</sub> responses (IC<sub>50</sub>=9.7 nM). <b>Conclusions:</b> 2-AG and SR1 modulate the GRAB<sub>eCB2.0</sub> fluorescent signal with EC<sub>50</sub> values that mirror their potencies at CB<sub>1</sub>R, whereas AEA, eCB analogues, THC, and CP increase GRAB<sub>eCB2.0</sub> fluorescent signal with EC<sub>50</sub> values significantly lower than their potencies at CB<sub>1</sub>R.

        "abstract": "<i>Histoplasma capsulatum</i> is a dimorphic fungal pathogen acquired via inhalation of soil-resident spores. Upon exposure to mammalian body temperatures, these fungal elements transform into yeasts that reside primarily within phagocytes. Macrophages (MΦ) provide a permissive environment for fungal replication until T cell-dependent immunity is engaged. MΦ activated by granulocyte-MΦ colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) induce metallothioneins (MTs) that bind zinc (Zn) and deprive yeast cells of labile Zn, thereby disabling fungal growth. Prior work demonstrated that the high affinity zinc importer, ZRT2, was important for fungal survival in vivo. Hence, we constructed a yeast cell reporter strain that expresses green fluorescent protein (GFP) under the control of this importer. This reporter accurately responds to medium devoid of Zn. ZRT2 expression increased (∼5-fold) in GM-CSF, but not interferon-γ, stimulated MΦ. To examine the in vivo response, we infected mice with reporter yeasts and assessed ZRT2 expression at 0-, 3-, 7-, and 14-days post-infection (dpi). ZRT2 expression minimally increased at 3-dpi and peaked on 7-dpi, corresponding with onset of adaptive immunity. We discovered that the major phagocyte populations that restrict Zn to the fungus are interstitial MΦ and exudate MΦ. Neutralizing GM-CSF blunted control of infection but unexpectedly increased ZRT2 expression. This increase was dependent on another cytokine that activates MΦ to control <i>H. capsulatum</i> replication, M-CSF. These findings illustrate the reporter's ability to sense Zn <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> and correlate ZRT2 activity with GM-CSF and M-CSF activation of MΦ. Phagocytes use an arsenal of defenses to control replication of <i>Histoplasma</i> yeasts, one of which is limitation of trace metals. On the other hand, <i>H. capsulatum</i> combats metal restriction by upregulating metal importers such as the Zn importer ZRT2. This transporter contributes to <i>H. capsulatum</i> pathogenesis upon activation of adaptive immunity. We constructed a fluorescent ZRT2 reporter to probe <i>H. capsulatum</i> Zn sensing during infection and exposed a role for M-CSF activation of macrophages when GM-CSF is absent. These data highlight the ways in which fungal pathogens sense metal deprivation in vivo and reveal the potential of metal-sensing reporters. The work adds a new dimension to studying how intracellular pathogens sense and respond to the changing environments of the host.",

However, these reporters may have certain drawbacks for some applications, such as transcription-based studies or biological interactions with fast dynamics. In this context, RNA nanotechnology has emerged as a promising alternative, suggesting the use of functional RNA molecules as transcriptional fluorescent reporters. RNA-based aptamers can bind to nonfluorescent small molecules to activate their fluorescence. However, their performance as reporters of gene expression in living cells has not been fully characterized, unlike protein-based reporters. Here, we investigate the performance of three RNA light-up aptamers─F30-2xdBroccoli, tRNA-Spinach, and Tornado Broccoli─as fluorescent reporters for gene expression in <i>Escherichia coli</i> and compare them to a protein reporter. We examine the activation range and effect on the cell growth of RNA light-up aptamers in time-course experiments and demonstrate that these aptamers are suitable transcriptional reporters over time. Using flow cytometry, we compare the variability at the single-cell level caused by the RNA fluorescent reporters and protein-based reporters. We found that the expression of RNA light-up aptamers produced higher variability in a population than that of their protein counterpart. Finally, we compare the dynamical behavior of these RNA light-up aptamers and protein-based reporters. We observed that RNA light-up aptamers might offer faster dynamics compared to a fluorescent protein in <i>E. coli</i>.

Opioid analgesics altered dopamine negative responses to aversive stimuli toward more positive responses, while excitatory responses of glutamate inputs remained unchanged.

Intracellular signaling pathways, including those mediated by cAMP, are key for regulated alpha and beta cell hormone secretion. The 3D islet structure, while essential for coordinated islet function, presents experimental challenges for mechanistic studies of the intracellular signaling pathways in primary human islet cells. To overcome these challenges and limitations, this protocol describes an integrated live-cell imaging and microfluidic platform using primary human pseudoislets generated from donors without diabetes that resemble native islets in their morphology, composition, and function. These pseudoislets are size-controlled through the dispersion and reaggregation process of primary human islet cells. In the dispersed state, islet cell gene expression can be manipulated; for example, biosensors such as the genetically encoded cAMP biosensor, cADDis, can be introduced.

Conventional measurement of micronutrients is often complex, laboratory-based, and not suitable for monitoring their bioavailable concentration. To address this need, we developed a fluorescence based microbial whole-cell biosensing (MWCB) system encoding for a Cu<sup>2+</sup>-responsive protein capable of generating a signal upon binding to Cu<sup>2+</sup>. The sensing-reporting protein was designed by performing circular permutation on the green fluorescent protein (GFP) followed by insertion of a Cu<sup>2+</sup> binding motif into the structure of GFP. The design included insertion of several binding motifs and creating plasmids that encoded the corresponding sensing proteins. The signal generated by the sensing-reporting protein is directly proportional to the concentration of Cu<sup>2+</sup> in the sample. Evaluation of the resulting biosensing systems carrying these plasmids was performed prior to selection of the optimal fluorescence emitting Cu<sup>2+</sup>-binding protein. The resulting optimized biosensing system was encapsulated in polyacrylate-alginate beads and embedded in soil for detection of the analyte. Once exposed to the soil, the beads were interrogated to measure the fluorescence signal emitted by the sensing-reporting protein using a portable imaging device. The biosensor was optimized for detection of Cu<sup>2+</sup> in terms of selectivity, sensitivity, matrix effects, detection limits, and reproducibility in both liquid and soil matrices. The limit of detection (LoD) of the optimized encapsulated biosensor was calculated as 0.27 mg/L and 1.26 mg/kg of Cu<sup>2+</sup> for Cu<sup>2+</sup> in solution and soil, respectively.

Here, we developed bioluminescent reporter bacteriophages for viable Cs-specific, substrate-free, rapid detection by introducing luciferase and its corresponding substrate-providing enzyme complex into the virulent phage ΦC01. Although the reporter phage ΦC01_lux, constructed by replacing non-essential genes for phage infectivity with a luxCDABE reporter operon, produced bioluminescence upon Cs infection, the emitted signal was quickly decayed due to the superior bacteriolytic activity of ΦC01. By truncating the membrane pore-forming protein holin and thus limiting its function, the bacterial lysis was delayed and the resultant engineered reporter phage ΦC01_lux_Δhol could produce a more stable and reliable bioluminescent signal. Accordingly, ΦC01_lux_Δhol was able to detect at least an average of 2 CFU/ml of Cs artificially contaminated PIF and Sunsik and food contact surface models within a total of 7 h of assays, including 5 h of pre-enrichment for Cs amplification.

Addressing this analytical challenge, we exemplify how the permeability of the <i>Escherichia coli</i> cell envelope can be dissected using a small-molecule-responsive fluorescent protein sensor. The approach is exemplified for the biotechnologically relevant macrolide rapamycin, for which we first construct an intensiometric rapamycin detector (iRapTor) while comprehensively probing key design principles in the iRapTor scaffold. Specifically, this includes the scope of minimal copolymeric linkers as a function of topology and the concomitant need for gate post residues. In a subsequent step, we apply iRapTors to assess the permeability of the <i>E. coli</i> cell envelope to rapamycin. Despite its lipophilic character, rapamycin does not readily diffuse across the <i>E. coli</i> envelope but can be enhanced by recombinantly expressing a nanopore in the outer membrane. Our study thus provides a blueprint for studying and actuating the permeation of small molecules across the prokaryotic cell envelope.",

Here, we developed an ultrasensitive mercury WCB by directed evolution of the mercury-responsive transcriptional activator (MerR) sensing module to detect ultratrace mercury. Subsequently, the mutant WCB (m4-1) responding to mercury in the parts per trillion range after 1 h of induction was obtained. Its detection limit (LOD) was 0.313 ng/L, comparable to those of some analytical instruments. Surprisingly, the m4-1 WCB also responded to methylmercury (LOD = 98 ng/L), which is far more toxic than inorganic mercury. For more convenient detection, we have increased another green fluorescent protein reporter module with an optimized 5' untranslated region (5' UTR) sequence. This yields two visual WCBs with an enhanced fluorescence output. At a concentration of 2.5 ng/L, the fluorescence signals can be directly observed by the naked eye. With the combination of mobile phone imaging and image processing software, the 2GC WCB provided simple, rapid, and reliable quantitative and qualitative analysis of real samples (LOD = 0.307 ng/L).

The infection process of A. salmonicida was studied by immersion of zebrafish larvae in 2 different doses of the bacteria and the fish mortality was monitored for three days. The bacterium caused a high mortality (65 %) in zebrafish larvae only when they were exposed to a high bacterial concentration (10<sup>7</sup> bacterial cells/mL). To evaluate the use of fluorescence microscopy to follow A. salmonicida infection in vivo, two different fluorescent strains generated by labeling an A. salmonicida strain with either, the green fluorescent protein (GFP), or with a previously reported siderophore amonabactin-sulforhodamine B conjugate (AMB-SRB), were used. The distribution of both labeled bacterial strains in the larvae tissues was evaluated by conventional and confocal fluorescence microscopy.

Since the AMB-SRB labeled bacteria showed a weaker signal, the larvae were imaged using a laser scanning confocal microscope after 48 h of exposure to the bacteria. Both fluorescent signals were mainly observed in the larvae digestive tract, suggesting that this is the main colonization route of zebrafish for waterborne A. salmonicida.

Herein, we construct a single quantum dot (QD)-based förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) biosensor for sensitive detection of METTL3/14 complex activity. In the presence of METTL3/14 complex, it catalyzes the methylation of adenine in the substrate probe, leading to the formation of m<sup>6</sup>A that protects the substrate probes from MazF-mediated cleavage.

Based on the pLVX-AcGFP1-N1 plasmid, the recombinant plasmid pLVX-COL1A1-enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) was constructed, in which the enhanced green fluorescent protein gene expression was regulated by the <i>COL1A1</i> promoter. The monoclonal cell line was acquired by stably transfecting pLVX-COL1A1-EGFP into the immortalized human hepatic stellate cell line LX-2 by the lentivirus packaging system and screening. The cell line was treated with transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) or co-treated with TGF-β1 and drugs with potential anti-hepatic fibrosis effects. The EGFP fluorescence intensity in cells was analyzed by the fluorescence microscope and ImageJ 1.49 software using a semi-quantitative method. The <i>COL1A1</i> and <i>EGFP</i> mRNA were detected by reverse transcription real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), and corresponding proteins were detected by Western blot. The recombinant plasmid pLVX-COL1A1-EGFP with the expression of <i>EGFP</i> regulated by <i>COL1A1</i> promoter was successfully constructed. Kozak sequence was added to enhance the expression of <i>EGFP</i>, which was identified by double digestion and sequencing. The LX-2 monoclonal cell line LX-2-CE stably transfected with pLVX-COL1A1-EGFP was obtained. After co-treatment with TGF-β1 and 5 μmol/L dihydrotanshinone Ⅰ with potential anti-hepatic fibrosis effect for 24 h, the total fluorescence intensity and the average fluorescence intensity of LX-2-CE were lower than those in TGF-β1 single treatment group (<i>P</i> < 0.05), the intracellular mRNA and protein levels of <i>COL1A1</i> and <i>EGFP</i> were also lower than those in the TGF-β1 single treatment group (<i>P</i> < 0.05). A reporter system for estimating activation of hepatic stellate cells based on <i>COL1A1</i> promoter regulated <i>EGFP</i> expression is successfully constructed, which could visually report the changes in <i>COL1A1</i> expression, one of the activation-related markers of hepatic stellate cells, <i>in vitro</i>.

Here, we selected five drosophilid species, including Drosophila melanogaster, inhabiting different ecological niches to compare their olfactory systems at multiple levels. We first identified ecologically relevant natural food odorants from every species and established species-specific odorant preferences. To compare odor coding in sensory neurons, we analyzed the antennal lobe (AL) structure, generated glomerular atlases, and developed GCaMP transgenic lines for all species. Although subsets of glomeruli showed distinct tuning profiles, odorants inducing species-specific preferences were coded generally similarly. Species distantly related or occupying different habitats showed more evident differences in odor coding, and further analysis revealed that changes in olfactory receptor (OR) sequences partially explain these differences. Our results demonstrate that genetic distance in phylogeny and ecological niche occupancy are key determinants in the evolution of ORs, AL structures, odor coding, and behavior. Interestingly, changes in odor coding among species could not be explained by evolutionary changes at a single olfactory processing level but rather are a complex phenomenon based on changes at multiple levels.",

The activation of Cytc is composed of several steps, including its transfer to the mitochondrial membrane, binding to cytochrome c heme lyase (CCHL) and covalent attachment to heme. The spectroscopic methods are often applied to study the structural changes of Cytc. However, they require the isolation of Cytc from cells and have limited availability under physiological conditions. Despite recent studies to elucidate the tightly regulated folding mechanism of Cytc, the role of these events and their association with different conformational states remain elusive. Here, we provide a genetically encoded fluorescence method that allows monitoring of the conformational changes of Cytc upon binding to heme and CCHL. Cerulean and Venus fluorescent proteins attached at the N and C terminals of Cytc can be used to determine its unfolded, intermediate, and native states by measuring FRET amplitude. We found that the noncovalent interaction of heme in the absence of CCHL induced a shift in the FRET signal, indicating the formation of a partially folded state. The higher concentration of heme and coexpression of CCHL gave rise to the recovery of Cytc native structure. We also found that Cytc was weakly associated with CCHL in the absence of heme. As a result, a FRET-based fluorescence approach was demonstrated to elucidate the mechanism of heme-induced Cytc conformational changes with spatiotemporal resolution and can be applied to study its interaction with small molecules and other protein partners in living cells.",

Therapies to treat FSGS are limited, and podocyte-specific drugs are unavailable. To address the need for treatments to delay or stop FSGS progression, researchers are exploring the repurposing of drugs that have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for other purposes. To identify drugs with potential to treat FSGS, we used a specific zebrafish screening strain to combine a high-content screening (HCS) approach with an in vivo model. This zebrafish screening strain expresses nitroreductase and the red fluorescent protein mCherry exclusively in podocytes (providing an indicator for podocyte depletion), as well as a circulating 78 kDa vitamin D-binding enhanced green fluorescent protein fusion protein (as a readout for proteinuria). To produce FSGS-like lesions in the zebrafish, we added 80 µ M metronidazole into the fish water. We used a specific screening microscope in conjunction with advanced image analysis methods to screen a library of 138 drugs and compounds (including some FDA-approved drugs) for podocyte-protective effects. Promising candidates were validated to be suitable for translational studies. After establishing this novel in vivo HCS assay, we identified seven drugs or compounds that were protective in our FSGS-like model. Validation experiments confirmed that the FDA-approved drug belinostat was protective against larval FSGS. Similar pan-histone deacetylase inhibitors also showed potential to reproduce this effect.

Photoinactivation spontaneously recovered over 5 min in the dark, and recovery was accelerated in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Mutational analysis of residues near the tripeptide fluorophore of jGCaMP8f pointed to a mechanism: Q69M/C70V greatly increased (~90%) photoinactivation, reminiscent of fluorescent protein fluorophore cis-trans photoswitching.

However, applicability of reporter mice for in vivo BLI could be further accelerated by increasing light intensity through the use of other luciferases and/or by improving the biodistribution of their substrates in the animal body. Here we created two Cre-dependent reporter mice incorporating luciferases oFluc derived from Pyrocoeli matsumurai and Akaluc, both of which had been reported previously to be brighter than Luc2 when using appropriate substrates; we then tested their bioluminescence in neural tissues and other organs in living mice. When expressed throughout the body, both luciferases emitted an intense yellow (oFluc) or far-red (Akaluc) light easily visible to the naked eye. oFluc and Akaluc were similarly bright in the pancreas for in vivo BLI; however, Akaluc was superior to oFluc for brain imaging, because its substrate, AkaLumine-HCl, was distributed to the brain more efficiently than the oFluc substrate, D-luciferin. We also demonstrated that the lights produced by oFluc and Akaluc were sufficiently spectrally distinct from each other for dual-color imaging in a single living mouse.

We then used these sensors in freely moving mice to measure both optogenetically evoked and behaviorally relevant DA release while measuring neurochemical signaling in the nucleus accumbens, amygdala, and cortex. Using these sensors, we also detected spatially resolved heterogeneous cortical DA release in mice performing various behaviors. These next-generation GRAB<sub>DA</sub> sensors provide a robust set of tools for imaging dopaminergic activity under a variety of physiological and pathological conditions.",

        "abstract": "Individuals who have experienced mild traumatic brain injuries (mTBIs) suffer from several comorbidities, including chronic pain. Despite extensive studies investigating the underlying mechanisms of mTBI-associated chronic pain, the role of inflammation in long-term pain after mTBIs is not fully elucidated. Given the shifting dynamics of inflammation, it is important to understand the spatial-longitudinal changes in inflammatory processes following mTBIs and their effects on TBI-related pain. We utilized a recently developed transgenic caspase-1 luciferase reporter mouse model to monitor caspase-1 activation through a thinned skull window in the in vivo setting following three closed-head mTBI events. Organotypic coronal brain slice cultures and acutely dissociated dorsal root ganglion (DRG) cells provided tissue-relevant context of inflammation signal. Mechanical allodynia was assessed by mechanical withdrawal threshold to von Frey and thermal hyperalgesia withdrawal latency to radiant heat. Mouse grimace scale (MGS) was used to detect spontaneous or non-evoked pain. In some experiments, mice were prophylactically treated with MCC950, a potent small molecule inhibitor of NLRP3 inflammasome assembly to inhibit injury-induced inflammatory signaling. Bioluminescence spatiotemporal dynamics were quantified in the head and hind paws, and caspase-1 activation was confirmed by immunoblot. Immunofluorescence staining was used to monitor the progression of astrogliosis and microglial activation in ex vivo brain tissue following repetitive closed-head mTBIs. Mice with repetitive closed-head mTBIs exhibited significant increases of the bioluminescence signals within the brain and paws in vivo for at least one week after each injury. Consistently, immunoblotting and immunofluorescence experiments confirmed that mTBIs led to caspase-1 activation, astrogliosis, and microgliosis. Persistent changes in MGS and hind paw withdrawal thresholds, indicative of pain states, were observed post-injury in the same mTBI animals in vivo. We also observed enhanced inflammatory responses in ex vivo brain slice preparations and DRG for at least 3 days following mTBIs. In vivo treatment with MCC950 significantly reduced caspase-1 activation-associated bioluminescent signals in vivo and decreased stimulus-evoked and non-stimulus evoked nociception. Our findings suggest that the inflammatory states in the brain and peripheral nervous system following repeated mTBIs are coincidental with the development of nociceptive sensitization, and that these events can be significantly reduced by inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome activation.",

To help bridge these knowledge gaps, we developed the first ever recombinant strain of CyHV-2 expressing bioluminescent and fluorescent reporter genes. Infection of <i>Carassius auratus</i> hosts with this recombinant by immersion facilitated the exploitation of various in vivo imaging techniques to establish the spatiotemporal aspects of CyHV-2 replication at larval, juvenile, and adult developmental stages. While less susceptible than later developmental stages, larvae were most permissive to CyHV-2 replication, leading to rapid systemic infection and high mortality. Permissivity to CyHV-2 decreased with advancing development, with adults being the least permissive and, thus, also exhibiting the least mortality. Across all developmental stages, the skin was the most susceptible and permissive organ to infection at the earliest sampling points post-infection, indicating that it represents the major portal of entry into these hosts.

An exogenous peptide (DPc10) binding promotes leaky RyR2 in cardiomyocytes and reports on that endogenous state. Conversely, calmodulin (CaM) binding inhibits RyR2 leak and low CaM affinity is diagnostic of leaky RyR2. These observations have led to designing a FRET biosensor for drug discovery targeting RyR2. We used FRET to clarify the molecular mechanism driving the DPc10-CaM interdependence when binding RyR2 in SR vesicles. We used donor-FKBP12.6 (D-FKBP) to resolve RyR2 binding of acceptor-CaM (A-CaM). In low nanomolar Ca<sup>2+</sup>, DPc10 decreased both FRET<sub>max</sub> (under saturating [A-CaM]) and the CaM/RyR2 binding affinity. In micromolar Ca<sup>2+</sup>, DPc10 decreased FRET<sub>max</sub> without affecting CaM/RyR2 binding affinity. This correlates with the analysis of fluorescence-lifetime-detected FRET, indicating that DPc10 lowers occupancy of the RyR2 CaM-binding sites in nanomolar (not micromolar) Ca<sup>2+</sup> and lengthens D-FKBP/A-CaM distances independent of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]. To observe DPc10/RyR2 binding, we used acceptor-DPc10 (A-DPc10). CaM weakens A-DPc10/RyR2 binding, with this effect being larger in micromolar versus nanomolar Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Moreover, A-DPc10/RyR2 binding is cooperative in a CaM- and FKBP-dependent manner, suggesting that both endogenous modulators promote concerted structural changes between RyR2 protomers for channel regulation. Aided by the analysis of cryo-EM structures, these insights inform further development of the DPc10-CaM paradigm for therapeutic discovery targeting RyR2.",

GPCR activation primarily initiates heterotrimeric G protein signaling. To detect ligand-induced G protein activation, Bioluminescence Resonance Energy Transfer (BRET)-based biosensors were previously developed. Here, we designed a novel set of Nanoluciferase (NLuc) BRET-based biosensors (REGA-SIGN) that covers all Gα protein families (i.e., Gα<sub>i/o</sub>, Gα<sub>Ss/L</sub>, Gα<sub>12/13</sub> and Gα<sub>q/15</sub>). REGA-SIGN uses NLuc as a bioluminescent donor and LSS-mKATE2, a red-shifted fluorophore, as an acceptor. Due to the enhanced spectral separation between donor and acceptor emission and the availability of a stable substrate for NLuc, this donor-acceptor pair enables sensitive kinetic assessment of G protein activity. After optimization, the NLuc integration sites into the Gα subunit largely corresponded with previously reported integration sites, except for Gα<sub>Ss/L</sub> for which we describe an alternative NLuc insertion site. G protein rescue experiments validated the biological activity of these Gα donor proteins. Direct comparison between EGFP and LSS-mKATE2 as acceptor fluorophores revealed improved sensitivity for nearly all G protein subtypes when using the latter one.

Such dysregulation may lead to oxidative damage when combined with oxidative stress overpassing the cell capacity to detoxify ROS. In this work, a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2)-regulated sulfiredoxin reporter (Srxn1-GFP) was used to measure the antioxidant response of HepG2 cells to a large series of drug and drug-like compounds (2230 compounds).

A selection of models was used to prospectively predict oxidative stress induced by a new set of compounds subsequently experimentally tested to validate the model predictions.

Ames assay is the existing gold standard method. However, the pathogenic bacteria model lacks metabolic enzymes and requires mass GTIs, leading to insufficient safety, accuracy, and sensitivity. Whole-cell microbial sensors (WCMSs) can use normal strains to simulate the metabolic environment, achieving safe, sensitive, and high-throughput detection and evaluation for GTIs. Here, based on whether GTIs causing DNA alkylation required metabolic enzymes or not, two DNA repair-responsive engineered WCMS systems were constructed including <i>Escherichia coli</i>-WCMS and yeast-WCMS. A DNA repair-responsive promoter as a sensing element was coupled with an enhanced green fluorescent protein as a reporter to construct plasmids for introduction into WCMS. The <i>ada</i> promoter was screened out in the <i>E. coli</i>-WCMS, while the <i>MAG1</i> promoter was selected for the yeast-WCMS. Different <i>E. coli</i> and yeast strains were modified by gene knockout and mutation to eliminate the interference and enhance the GTI retention in cells and further improved the sensitivity. Finally, GTI consumption of WCMS for the evaluation of methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) and nitrosamines was decreased to 0.46-8.53 μg and 0.068 ng-2.65 μg, respectively, decreasing 2-3 orders of magnitude compared to traditional methods.

        "abstract": "Endocannabinoids (eCB) and cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1) play important roles in mediating short- and long-term synaptic plasticity in many brain regions involved in learning and memory, as well as the reinforcing effects of misused substances. Ethanol-induced plasticity and neuroadaptations predominantly occur in striatal direct pathway projecting medium spiny neurons (dMSNs). It is hypothesized that alterations in eCB neuromodulation may be involved. Recent work has implicated a role of eCB 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) in the rewarding effects of ethanol. However, there is insufficient research to answer which cellular subtype is responsible for mediating the 2-AG eCB signal that might be involved in the rewarding properties of ethanol and the mechanisms by which that occurs. To examine the role of dMSN mediated 2-AG signaling in ethanol related synaptic transmission and behaviors, we used conditional knockout mice in which the 2-AG-synthesizing enzyme diacylglycerol lipase α (DGLα) was deleted in dMSNs, DGLα<sup>D1-Cre+</sup>. Using acute brain slice photometry and a genetically encoded fluorescent eCB sensor, GRAB<sub>eCB2.0,</sub> to assess real-time eCB mediated activity of sensorimotor inputs from primary motor cortices (M1/M2) to the dorsolateral striatum, we showed that DGLα<sup>D1-Cre+</sup> mice had blunted evoked eCB-mediated presynaptic eCB signaling compared to littermate controls. Furthermore, ethanol induced eCB inhibition was significantly reduced in DGLα<sup>D1-Cre+</sup> deficient mice. Additionally, there was a reduction in the duration of loss of righting reflex (LORR) to a high dose of ethanol in the DGLα<sup>D1-Cre+</sup> mice compared to controls. These mice also showed a male-specific decrease in ethanol preference accompanied by an increase in ethanol-induced water consumption in a voluntary drinking paradigm. There were no significant differences observed in sucrose and quinine consumption between the genotypes. These findings reveal a novel role for dMSN mediated 2-AG signaling in modulating ethanol effects on presynaptic function and behavior.",

        "abstract": "Synaptic plasticity is a fundamental feature of the CNS that controls the magnitude of signal transmission between communicating cells. Many electrical synapses exhibit substantial plasticity that modulates the degree of coupling within groups of neurons, alters the fidelity of signal transmission, or even reconfigures functional circuits. In several known examples, such plasticity depends on calcium and is associated with neuronal activity. Calcium-driven signaling is known to promote potentiation of electrical synapses in fish Mauthner cells, mammalian retinal AII amacrine cells, and inferior olive neurons, and to promote depression in thalamic reticular neurons. To measure local calcium dynamics <i>in situ</i>, we developed a transgenic mouse expressing a GCaMP calcium biosensor fused to Connexin 36 (Cx36) at electrical synapses. We examined the sources of calcium for activity-dependent plasticity in retina slices using confocal or Super-Resolution Radial Fluctuations imaging. More than half of Cx36-GCaMP gap junctions responded to puffs of glutamate with transient increases in fluorescence. The responses were strongly dependent on NMDA receptors, in keeping with known activity-dependent signaling in some amacrine cells. We also found that some responses depended on the activity of voltage-gated calcium channels, representing a previously unrecognized source of calcium to control retinal electrical synaptic plasticity. The high prevalence of calcium signals at electrical synapses in response to glutamate application indicates that a large fraction of electrical synapses has the potential to be regulated by neuronal activity. This provides a means to tune circuit connectivity dynamically based on local activity.",

Through compensating for the missing peptide blocks in the alignment, 10 sibling sequences were artificially fabricated and named from ALuc55 to ALuc68. The phylogenetic analysis showed that the new ALucs formed an independent branch that was genetically isolated from other natural marine luciferases. The new ALucs successfully survived and luminesced with native coelenterazine (nCTZ) and its analogs in living mammalian cells. The results showed that the bioluminescence (BL) intensities of the ALucs were interestingly proportional to the length of the appended peptide blocks. The computational modeling revealed that the appended peptide blocks created a flexible region near the active site, potentially modulating the enzymatic activities. The new ALucs generated various colors with maximally approximately 90 nm redshifted BL spectra in orange upon reaction with the authors' previously reported <b>1</b>- and <b>2</b>-series coelenterazine analogs. The utilities of the new ALucs in bioassays were demonstrated through the construction of single-chain molecular strain probes and protein fragment complementation assay (PCA) probes.

By tuning the number of hydroxyl groups, we optimize the selectivity of fluorescent protein chromophores toward aggregated proteins in these biological samples. In recombinant protein applications, the most hydrophobic P0 (cLogP = 5.28) offers the highest fold change (FC = 31.6), sensitivity (LLOD = 0.1 μM), and brightness (Φ = 0.20) upon binding to aggregated proteins. In contrast, P4 of balanced amphiphilicity (cLogP = 2.32) is required for selective detection of proteome stresses in live cells. In mouse and human liver histology tissues, hydrophobic P1 exhibits the best performance in staining the aggregated proteome. Overall, the amphiphilicity of fluorescent chromophores governs the sensor's performance by matching the diverse nature of different biological samples.

The SCN is composed of two major peptidergic neuron types in the core and shell regions of the SCN. Determining how mRGCs interact with the network of synaptic connections onto and between SCN neurons is key to understand how light regulates the circadian clock and to elucidate the relevant local circuits within the SCN. To map these connections, we used a newly developed Cre-dependent electron microscopy (EM) reporter, APEX2, to label the mitochondria of mRGC axons. Serial blockface scanning electron microscopy was then used to resolve the fine 3D structure of mRGC axons and synaptic boutons in the SCN of a male mouse. The resulting maps reveal patterns of connectomic organization in the core and shell of the SCN. We show that these regions are composed of different neuronal subtypes and differ with regard to the pattern of mRGC input, as the shell receives denser mRGC synaptic input compared with the core.

In this study, we further explored the dynamics of FGFR2 expression through an enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) reporter mouse line (FGFR2-eGFP). We observed that FGFR2-eGFP is present in the late 8-cell stage; however, it is absent or reduced in the ICM of early blastocysts. We then statistically correlated eGFP expression with PE and EPI markers GATA6 and NANOG, respectively. We detected that eGFP is weakly correlated with GATA6 in early blastocysts, but this correlation quickly increases as the blastocyst develops. The correlation between eGFP and NANOG decreases throughout blastocyst development. Treatment with FGF from the morula stage onwards did not affect FGFR2-eGFP presence in the ICM of early blastocysts; however, late blastocysts presented FGFR2-eGFP in all cells of the ICM. BMP treatment positively influenced FGFR2-eGFP expression and reduced the number of NANOG-positive cells in late blastocysts. In conclusion, FGFR2 is not strongly associated with PE precursors in the early blastocyst, but it is highly correlated with PE cells as blastocyst development progresses, consistent with the proposed role for FGFR2 in maintenance rather than initiating the PE lineage.",

Two independent probes, one inserted in an extracellular site distal to the pore and the other in a distant intracellular proximal position, elicit sizable fluorescence signals when the tagged channels activate in response to fluid shear stress of low intensity. Neither cellular indentations nor osmotic swelling of the cell elicit detectable fluorescence signals from either probe, despite the ability of these stimuli to activate the tagged channels.

Over the last several decades, many studies have been conducted to determine possible CEST agents, such as endogenously expressed compounds or proteins, that can be utilized to produce contrast with minimally invasive procedures and reduced or non-existent levels of toxicity. In recent years there has been an increased interest in the generation of genetically engineered CEST contrast agents, typically based on existing proteins with CEST contrast or modified to produce CEST contrast. We have developed an in silico method for the evolution of peptide sequences to optimize CEST contrast and showed that these peptides could be combined to create de novo biosensors for CEST MRI. A single protein, superCESTide, was designed to be 198 amino acids. SuperCESTide was expressed in E. coli and purified with size exclusion chromatography. The magnetic transfer ratio asymmetry generated by superCESTide was comparable to levels seen in previous CEST reporters, such as protamine sulfate (salmon protamine) and human protamine. These data show that novel peptides with sequences optimized in silico for CEST contrast that utilize a more comprehensive range of amino acids can still produce contrast when assembled into protein units expressed in complex living environments.",

This new aSyn FRET biosensor improves the signal-to-noise ratio, reduces nonspecific background FRET, and results in a 4-fold increase (transient transfection) and 2-fold increase (stable, inducible cell lines) in FRET signal relative to our previous GFP/RFP aSyn biosensors.

This process converted target recognition into an amplified bioluminescence response, enabling smartphone-based quantification of tetracycline and erythromycin directly in milk within 15 min. Moreover, the detection threshold of eBLUE can be easily tuned according to the maximum residue limits (MRLs) established by government agencies. Owing to this tunable nature, the eBLUE was further repurposed as an on-demand semi-quantification platform, allowing for fast (∼20 min) and software-free identification of safe and MRL-exceeding milk samples only by glancing over the smartphone photographs.

While the standard redox potentials of those systems are known, the in vivo \"steady state\" redox potential imposed onto protein thiol disulfide pairs in the periplasm remains unknown. Here, we used genetically encoded redox probes (roGFP2 and roGFP-iL), targeted to the periplasm, to directly probe the thiol redox homeostasis in this compartment. These probes contain two cysteine residues that are virtually completely reduced in the cytoplasm, but once exported into the periplasm, can form a disulfide bond, a process that can be monitored by fluorescence spectroscopy. Even in the absence of DsbA, roGFP2, exported to the periplasm, was almost fully oxidized, suggesting the presence of an alternative system for the introduction of disulfide bonds into exported proteins. However, the absence of DsbA shifted the steady state periplasmic thiol-redox potential from -228 mV to a more reducing -243 mV and the capacity to re-oxidize periplasmic roGFP2 after a reductive pulse was significantly decreased. Re-oxidation in a DsbA strain could be fully restored by exogenous oxidized glutathione (GSSG), while reduced GSH accelerated re-oxidation of roGFP2 in the WT. In line, a strain devoid of endogenous glutathione showed a more reducing periplasm, and was significantly worse in oxidatively folding PhoA, a native periplasmic protein and substrate of the oxidative folding machinery. PhoA oxidative folding could be enhanced by the addition of exogenous GSSG in the WT and fully restored in a ΔdsbA mutant.

However, when fused to a Sec signal peptide, msfGFP fluorescence was present outside cells, indicating successful export of the msfGFP in the unfolded state, followed by extracellular folding and maturation to the photoactive state. We applied this strategy to study coagulase (Coa), a secreted protein and a major contributor to the formation of a fibrin network in <i>S. aureus</i> biofilms that protects bacteria from the host immune system and increases attachment to host surfaces. We confirmed that a genomically integrated C-terminal fusion of Coa to msfGFP does not impair the activity of Coa or its localisation within the biofilm matrix.

These natural mechanisms can be sourced by researchers to build Biological Sensors (BioS) by combining them with an easily measurable output, such as fluorescence. Because they are genetically encoded, BioS are cheap, fast, sustainable, portable, self-generating and highly sensitive and specific. Therefore, BioS hold the potential to become key enabling tools that stimulate innovation and scientific exploration in various disciplines. However, the main bottleneck in unlocking the full potential of BioS is the fact that there is no standardized, efficient and tunable platform available for the high-throughput construction and characterization of biosensors. Therefore, a modular, Golden Gate-based construction platform, called MoBioS, is introduced in this article. It allows for the fast and easy creation of transcription factor-based biosensor plasmids. As a proof of concept, its potential is demonstrated by creating eight different, functional and standardized biosensors that detect eight diverse molecules of industrial interest.

The biosensor, mitochondria-targeted HyPer7 (mtHyPer7), detects hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in mitochondria. It consists of a mitochondrial signal sequence fused to a circularly permuted fluorescent protein and the H2O2-responsive domain of a bacterial OxyR protein. The biosensor is generated and integrated into the yeast genome using a CRISPR-Cas9 marker-free system, for more consistent expression compared to plasmid-borne constructs. mtHyPer7 is quantitatively targeted to mitochondria, has no detectable effect on yeast growth rate or mitochondrial morphology, and provides a quantitative readout for mitochondrial H2O2 under normal growth conditions and upon exposure to oxidative stress. This protocol explains how to optimize imaging conditions using a spinning-disk confocal microscope system and perform quantitative analysis using freely available software. These tools make it possible to collect rich spatiotemporal information on mitochondria both within cells and among cells in a population.

Current methods for measuring bacterial protease activity in milk are insensitive and too slow to be used in routine testing in dairy processing plants. We have designed a novel bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET)-based biosensor to measure the activity of proteases secreted by bacteria in milk. The BRET-based biosensor is highly selective for bacterial protease activity compared with other proteases tested, notably including plasmin, which is abundant in milk. It incorporates a novel peptide linker that is selectively cleaved by P. fluorescens AprX proteases. The peptide linker is flanked by green fluorescent protein (GFP<sup>2</sup>) at the N-terminus and a variant Renilla luciferase (RLuc2) at the C-terminus. Complete cleavage of the linker by bacterial proteases from Pseudomonas fluorescens strain 65, leads to a 95% decrease in the BRET ratio. We applied an azocasein-based calibration method to the AprX biosensor using standard international enzyme activity units. In a 10-min assay, the detection limit for AprX protease activity in buffer was equivalent to 40 pg/mL (≈0.8 pM, 22 μU/mL) and 100 pg/mL (≈2pM, 54 μU/mL) in 50% (v/v) full fat milk. The EC<sub>50</sub> values were 1.1 ± 0.3 ng/mL (87 μU/mL) and 6.8 ± 0.2 ng/mL (540 μU/mL), respectively. The biosensor was approximately 800x more sensitive than the established FITC-Casein method in a 2-h assay, the shortest feasible time for the latter method. The protease biosensor is sensitive and fast enough to be used in production settings.

Region of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) tethered to mitochondria, named as the mitochondrial-associated membranes (MAMs), has received an extended attention since the last 5 years. Indeed, as MAMs are essential for calcium homeostasis and mitochondrial function, molecular tools have been developed to assess quantitatively Ca2+ levels in the MAMs. However, sensitivity of the first generation Ca2+ biosensors on the surface of the outer-mitochondrial membrane (OMM) do not allow to measure μM or sub-μM changes in Ca2+ concentration which prevents to measure the native activity (unstimulated exogenously) of endogenous channels. In this study, we assembled a new ratiometric highly sensitive Ca2+ biosensor expressed on the surface of the outer-mitochondrial membrane (OMM). It allows the detection of smaller differences than the previous biosensor in or at proximity of the MAMs. Noteworthy, we demonstrated that IP3-receptors have an endogenous activity which participate to the Ca2+ leak channel on the surface of the OMM during hypoxia or when SERCA activity is blocked.",

It is therefore important to monitor the bioavailable and hence toxic fraction of uranium in the environment, but no efficient measurement methods exist for this. Our study aims to fill this gap by developing a genetically encoded FRET-based ratiometric uranium biosensor. This biosensor was constructed by grafting two fluorescent proteins to both ends of calmodulin, a protein that binds four calcium ions. By modifying the metal-binding sites and the fluorescent proteins, several versions of the biosensor were generated and characterized <i>in vitro</i>. The best combination results in a biosensor that is affine and selective for uranium compared to metals such as calcium or other environmental compounds (sodium, magnesium, chlorine). It has a good dynamic range and should be robust to environmental conditions.

In this study, we identify relocation sensor candidates for both Rac and Cdc42. We compared their (1) ability to bind the constitutively active Rho GTPases, (2) specificity for Rac and Cdc42, and (3) relocation efficiency in cell-based assays. Subsequently, the relocation efficiency was improved by a multi-domain approach. For Rac1, we found a sensor candidate with low relocation efficiency. For Cdc42, we found several sensors with sufficient relocation efficiency and specificity. These optimized sensors enable the wider application of Rho GTPase relocation sensors, which was showcased by the detection of local endogenous Cdc42 activity at assembling invadopodia. Moreover, we tested several fluorescent proteins and HaloTag for their influence on the recruitment efficiency of the Rho location sensor, to find optimal conditions for a multiplexing experiment.

The aberrant expression of circRNAs may result in various diseases. Herein, we demonstrate the construction of genetically encoded light-up RNA aptamers for ultrasensitive and label-free detection of circRNA mitochondrial tRNA translation optimization 1 (circMTO1) in cancer cells and tissues. The light-up RNA aptamers are generated by proximity ligation-activated recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA)-assisted transcription amplification. When circMTO1 is present, it initiates the proximity ligation reaction, activating RPA to produce numerous long double-stranded DNAs containing T7 promoters. Subsequently, the RPA products are identified by T7 RNA polymerase, initiating the transcription amplification reaction to generate abundant Spinach RNA aptamers. Spinach RNA aptamers can bind with DFHBI (3,5-difluoro-4-hydroxybenzylidene imidazolidinone) dye to produce a distinct fluorescence signal with near-zero background. This biosensor exhibits excellent selectivity and high sensitivity with a limit of detection of 2.54 aM. It can accurately monitor cellular circMTO1 at the single-cell level and discriminate the expression of circMTO1 between breast cancer patient tissues and healthy tissues.

Here, we revealed the localization and activation of Racs in cochlear HCs using GFP-tagged Rac plasmids and transgenic mice expressing a Rac1-fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) biosensor. Furthermore, we employed Rac1-knockout (Rac1-KO, Atoh1-Cre;Rac1<sup>flox/flox</sup>) and Rac1 and Rac3 double KO (Rac1/Rac3-DKO, Atoh1-Cre;Rac1<sup>flox/flox</sup>;Rac3<sup>-/-</sup>) mice, under the control of the Atoh1 promoter. However, both Rac1-KO and Rac1/Rac3-DKO mice exhibited normal cochlear HC morphology at 13 weeks of age and normal hearing function at 24 weeks of age. No hearing vulnerability was observed in young adult (6-week-old) Rac1/Rac3-DKO mice even after intense noise exposure. Consistent with prior reports, the results from Atoh1-Cre;tdTomato mice confirmed that the Atoh1 promoter became functional only after embryonic day 14 when the sensory HC precursors exit the cell cycle. Taken together, these findings indicate that although Rac1 and Rac3 contribute to the early development of sensory epithelia in cochleae, as previously shown, they are dispensable for the maturation of cochlear HCs in the postmitotic state or for hearing maintenance following HC maturation.

To date, various attempts have been made to cultivate <i>Ganoderma</i> to improve the production of secondary metabolites with pharmacological activity. Among the adopted techniques, protoplast preparation and regeneration are indispensable. However, the evaluation of protoplasts and regenerated cell walls usually relies on electron microscopy assays, which require time-consuming and destructive sample preparation and merely provide localized information in the selected area. In contrast, fluorescence assays enable sensitive real-time detection and imaging <i>in vivo</i>. They can also be applied to flow cytometry, providing a collective overview of every cell in a sample. However, for macrofungi such as <i>Ganoderma</i>, the fluorescence analysis of protoplasts and regenerated cell walls is difficult owing to the hindrance of the homologous fluorescent protein expression and the lack of an appropriate fluorescence marker. Herein, a specific plasma membrane probe, TAMRA perfluorocarbon nucleic acid probe (TPFN), is proposed for the nondestructive and quantitative fluorescence analysis of cell wall regeneration. Exploiting the perfluorocarbon membrane-anchoring chains, hydrophilic nucleic acid linker, and fluorescent dye TAMRA, the probe is proven to be selective, soluble, and stable, enabling rapid fluorescence detection of a protoplast sample free of transgenic expression or immune staining. Based on the TPFN and flow cytometry techniques, a quantitative approach is constructed to monitor the process of cell wall growth in a fast, quantitative, and high-throughout manner, and the obtained results are consistent with those of conventional electron microscopy. In principle, with slight modifications or integration, the proposed probe and approach can be adapted to the preparation of cell protoplasts, inspection of cell wall integrity under environmental stress, and programmable membrane engineering for cytobiology and physiology research.",

We engrafted patient and control iPSC-derived neural progenitor cells (hNPCs) into the striatum of mice.

Alongside this improved detection in ENoMi-hNPCs-derived EVs, their surface allows specific immunocapture purification, thereby facilitating TAF1-32i analysis. Using this ENoMi-labeling method, TAF1-32i was demonstrated in EVs released from XDP hNPCs implanted in mouse brains.

Our effort has resulted in two responsive ecpApple mutants: one bestows reactivity toward both peroxynitrite and hydrogen peroxide, while the other, namely, pnRFP, is a selective red fluorescent peroxynitrite biosensor. We characterized pnRFP <i>in vitro</i> and in live mammalian cells. We further studied the structure and sensing mechanism of pnRFP using X-ray crystallography, <sup>11</sup>B-NMR, and computational methods. The boron atom in pnRFP adopts an sp<sup>2</sup>-hybridization geometry in a hydrophobic pocket, and the reaction of pnRFP with peroxynitrite generates a product with a twisted chromophore, corroborating the observed \"turn-off\" fluorescence response.

Using various mutant strains and inhibitors, we show that AKAR3-EV measures the Sch9p- and PKA-dependent phosphorylation status in intact yeast cells. At the single-cell level, we found that the phosphorylation responses are homogenous for glucose, sucrose, and fructose, but heterogeneous for mannose. Cells that start to grow after a transition to mannose correspond to higher normalized Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) levels, in line with the involvement of Sch9p and PKA pathways to stimulate growth-related processes. The Sch9p and PKA pathways have a relatively high affinity for glucose (K0.5 of 0.24 mM) under glucose-derepressed conditions. Lastly, steady-state FRET levels of AKAR3-EV seem to be independent of growth rates, suggesting that Sch9p- and PKA-dependent phosphorylation activities are transient responses to nutrient transitions.

Subcellular AMPK activity results in regulation of glycolysis, lipid and protein biosynthesis, mitochondrial function, and gene expression.

Key tools for studying subcellular AMPK activity are genetically encoded AMPK activity reporters (AMPKARs), which allow for the quantitative visualization of subcelluar AMPK activity. However, many AMPKARs suffer from poor dynamic range and sensitivity, limiting their application. I recently reported the development of a new excitation-ratiometric (ExRai) AMPKAR, a single-fluorophore AMPKAR with enhanced dynamic range for detection of subtle, subcellular AMPK activity. I used ExRai AMPKAR to study subcellular AMPK activity at several locations, including the lysosome and mitochondria, identifying new mechanisms for the regulation of AMPK activity.

By fine-tuning the residues of peptides, a mini tetrapeptide (Cys-Phe-Phe-His) was designed, which can act as a hydrogen peroxide sensor using its ratiometric fluorescence. The roGFP2 mimetic tetrapeptide is biocompatible and photostable and has competitive fluorescent properties with roGFP2 by the virtue of its assembly induced emissions.

Many single-emission G4 fluorescent probes that are lit up by inhibiting intramolecular rotation have been reported. However, they are non-fluorescent unless structurally rigidified, making them sensitive to other intracellular crowding and confinement environments in the cell, like viscosity. Ratiometric measurements provide built-in self-calibration for signal correction, enabling more sensitive and reliable detection. Herein, we structurally modulate green fluorescent protein (GFP)-like chromophores by integrating the imidazolidinone scaffold of the GFP chromophore and coumarin 6H, obtaining a G4 responsive dual-emission chromophore, called NHCouI. The red emission signal of NHCouI can specifically respond to parallel G4s, while its green emission signal is inert and acts as an internal reference signal. NHCouI-G4 complexes feature high fluorescence quantum yield and excellent anti-photobleaching properties. NHCouI can self-calibrate the signal and avoid viscosity disturbances within the range of major subcellular organelles during G4 imaging in living cells. It is also applied to reflect the difference between apoptosis and ferroptosis <i>via</i> tracking G4s. To the best of our knowledge, NHCouI is the first small molecule G4 probe enabled by internal reference correction capability, opening up new avenues for dual-emission chromophore development and high-fidelity and reliable analysis in G4 imaging research.",

        "abstract": "Pichia pastoris (Komagataella phaffii) is widely used for industrial production of heterologous proteins due to high secretory capabilities but selection of highly productive engineered strains remains a limiting step. Despite availability of a comprehensive molecular toolbox for construct design and gene integration, there is high clonal variability among transformants due to frequent multi-copy and off-target random integration. Therefore, functional screening of several hundreds of transformant clones is essential to identify the best protein production strains. Screening methods are commonly based on deep-well plate cultures with analysis by immunoblotting or enzyme activity assays of post-induction samples, and each heterologous protein produced may require development of bespoke assays with multiple sample processing steps. In this work, we developed a generic system based on a P. pastoris strain that uses a protein-based biosensor to identify highly productive protein secretion clones from a heterogeneous set of transformants. The biosensor uses a split green fluorescent protein where the large GFP fragment (GFP1-10) is fused to a sequence-specific protease from Tobacco Etch Virus (TEV) and is targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum. Recombinant proteins targeted for secretion are tagged with the small fragment of the split GFP (GFP11). Recombinant protein production can be measured by monitoring GFP fluorescence, which is dependent on interaction between the large and small GFP fragments. The reconstituted GFP is cleaved from the target protein by TEV protease, allowing for secretion of the untagged protein of interest and intracellular retention of the mature GFP. We demonstrate this technology with four recombinant proteins (phytase, laccase, β-casein and β-lactoglobulin) and show that the biosensor directly reports protein production levels that correlate with traditional assays. Our results confirm that the split GFP biosensor can be used for facile, generic, and rapid screening of P. pastoris clones to identify those with the highest production levels.",

Such particles also contaminate surfaces, creating a potential surface-transmission pathway. A fast acoustic biosensor with an antifouling nano-coating was introduced to detect severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on exposed surfaces in the Prague Public Transport System. Samples were measured directly without pre-treatment. Results with the sensor gave excellent agreement with parallel quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) measurements on 482 surface samples taken from actively used trams, buses, metro trains and platforms between 7 and 9 April 2021, in the middle of the lineage Alpha SARS-CoV-2 epidemic wave when 1 in 240 people were COVID-19 positive in Prague. Only ten of the 482 surface swabs produced positive results and none of them contained virus particles capable of replication, indicating that positive samples contained inactive virus particles and/or fragments. Measurements of the rate of decay of SARS-CoV-2 on frequently touched surface materials showed that the virus did not remain viable longer than 1-4 h. The rate of inactivation was the fastest on rubber handrails in metro escalators and the slowest on hard-plastic seats, window glasses and stainless-steel grab rails. As a result of this study, Prague Public Transport Systems revised their cleaning protocols and the lengths of parking times during the pandemic. Our findings suggest that surface transmission played no or negligible role in spreading SARS-CoV-2 in Prague.

The molecular structure of BMs is a fine meshwork that incorporates specialized extracellular matrix proteins. Recently, live visualization of BMs in invertebrates demonstrated that their structure is flexible and dynamically rearranged during cell differentiation and organogenesis. However, the BM dynamics in mammalian tissues remain to be elucidated. We developed a mammalian BM imaging probe based on nidogen-1, a major BM-specific protein. Recombinant human nidogen-1 fused with an enhanced green fluorescent protein (Nid1-EGFP) retains its ability to bind to other BM proteins, such as laminin, type IV collagen, and perlecan, in a solid-phase binding assay. When added to the culture medium of embryoid bodies derived from mouse ES cells, recombinant Nid1-EGFP accumulated in the BM zone of embryoid bodies, and BMs were visualized <i>in vitro</i>. For <i>in vivo</i> BM imaging, a knock-in reporter mouse line expressing human nidogen-1 fused to the red fluorescent protein mCherry (R26-CAG-Nid1-mCherry) was generated. R26-CAG-Nid1-mCherry showed fluorescently labeled BMs in early embryos and adult tissues, such as the epidermis, intestine, and skeletal muscles, whereas BM fluorescence was unclear in several other tissues, such as the lung and heart. In the retina, Nid1-mCherry fluorescence visualized the BMs of vascular endothelium and pericytes. In the developing retina, Nid1-mCherry fluorescence labeled the BM of the major central vessels; however, the BM fluorescence were hardly observed in the peripheral growing tips of the vascular network, despite the presence of endothelial BM. Time-lapse observation of the retinal vascular BM after photobleaching revealed gradual recovery of Nid1-mCherry fluorescence, suggesting the turnover of BM components in developing retinal blood vessels. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of <i>in vivo</i> BM imaging using a genetically engineered mammalian model. Although R26-CAG-Nid1-mCherry has some limitations as an <i>in vivo</i> BM imaging model, it has potential applications in the study of BM dynamics during mammalian embryogenesis, tissue regeneration, and pathogenesis.",

        "abstract": "The mesolimbic dopamine system is an evolutionarily conserved set of brain circuits that play a role in attention, appetitive behavior, and reward processing. In this circuitry, ascending dopaminergic projections from the ventral midbrain innervate targets throughout the limbic forebrain, such as the ventral striatum/nucleus accumbens (NAc). Dopaminergic signaling in the NAc has been widely studied for its role in behavioral reinforcement, reward prediction error encoding, and motivational salience. Less well characterized is the role of dopaminergic neurotransmission in the response to surprising or alerting sensory events. To address this, we used the genetically encoded dopamine sensor dLight1 and fiber photometry to explore the ability of striatal dopamine release to encode the properties of salient sensory stimuli in mice, such as threatening looming discs. Here, we report that lateral NAc (LNAc) dopamine release encodes the rate and magnitude of environmental luminance changes rather than the visual stimulus threat level. This encoding is highly sensitive, as LNAc dopamine could be evoked by light intensities that were imperceptible to human experimenters. We also found that light-evoked dopamine responses are wavelength-dependent at low irradiances, independent of the circadian cycle, robust to previous exposure history, and involve multiple phototransduction pathways. Thus, we have further elaborated the mesolimbic dopamine system's ability to encode visual information in mice, which is likely relevant to a wide body of scientists employing light sources or optical methods in behavioral research involving rodents.",

When targeted to the lumen of SVs, fluorescence of these proteins is quenched by the acidic pH. Following SV fusion, they are exposed to extracellular neutral pH, resulting in a fluorescence increase. SV fusion, recycling and acidification can thus be tracked by tagging integral SV proteins with pH-sensitive proteins. Neurotransmission is generally activated by electrical stimulation, which is not feasible in small, intact animals. Previous <i>in vivo</i> approaches depended on distinct (sensory) stimuli, thus limiting the addressable neuron types. To overcome these limitations, we established an all-optical approach to stimulate and visualize SV fusion and recycling. We combined distinct pH-sensitive fluorescent proteins (inserted into the SV protein synaptogyrin) and light-gated channelrhodopsins (ChRs) for optical stimulation, overcoming optical crosstalk and thus enabling an all-optical approach. We generated two different variants of the pH-sensitive optogenetic reporter of vesicle recycling (pOpsicle) and tested them in cholinergic neurons of intact <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> nematodes. First, we combined the red fluorescent protein pHuji with the blue-light gated ChR2(H134R), and second, the green fluorescent pHluorin combined with the novel red-shifted ChR ChrimsonSA. In both cases, fluorescence increases were observed after optical stimulation. Increase and subsequent decline of fluorescence was affected by mutations of proteins involved in SV fusion and endocytosis.

        "abstract": "The small GTPase Ras is frequently mutated in cancer and a driver of tumorigenesis. The recent years have shown great progress in drug-targeting Ras and understanding how it operates on the plasma membrane. We now know that Ras is non-randomly organized into proteo-lipid complexes on the membrane, called nanoclusters. Nanoclusters contain only a few Ras proteins and are necessary for the recruitment of downstream effectors, such as Raf. If tagged with fluorescent proteins, the dense packing of Ras in nanoclusters can be analyzed by Förster/ fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). Loss of FRET can therefore report on decreased nanoclustering and any process upstream of it, such as Ras lipid modifications and correct trafficking. Thus, cellular FRET screens employing Ras-derived fluorescence biosensors are potentially powerful tools to discover chemical or genetic modulators of functional Ras membrane organization. Here we implement fluorescence anisotropy-based homo-FRET measurements of Ras-derived constructs labelled with only one fluorescent protein on a confocal microscope and a fluorescence plate reader. We show that homo-FRET of both H-Ras- and K-Ras-derived constructs can sensitively report on Ras-lipidation and -trafficking inhibitors, as well as on genetic perturbations of proteins regulating membrane anchorage. By exploiting the switch I/II-binding Ras-dimerizing compound BI-2852, this assay is also suitable to report on the engagement of the K-Ras switch II pocket by small molecules such as AMG 510.

Double-cut and double-nick donor formats significantly improved targeting accuracy by 2.3-8.3-fold and 19-22-fold, respectively, compared to standard circular donors.

Although this design is simple to envision, its execution is not obvious.

        "abstract": "Visceral smooth muscle cells (SMCs) are an integral component of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract that regulate GI motility. SMC contraction is regulated by posttranslational signaling and the state of differentiation. Impaired SMC contraction is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, but the mechanisms regulating SMC-specific contractile gene expression, including the role of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), remain largely unexplored. Herein, we reveal a critical role of Carmn (cardiac mesoderm enhancer-associated noncoding RNA), an SMC-specific lncRNA, in regulating visceral SMC phenotype and contractility of the GI tract. Genotype-Tissue Expression and publicly available single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data sets from embryonic, adult human, and mouse GI tissues were interrogated to identify SMC-specific lncRNAs. The functional role of Carmn was investigated using novel green fluorescent protein (GFP) knock-in (KI) reporter/knock-out (KO) mice. Bulk RNA-seq and single nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) of colonic muscularis were used to investigate underlying mechanisms. Unbiased in silico analyses and GFP expression patterns in Carmn GFP KI mice revealed that Carmn is highly expressed in GI SMCs in humans and mice. Premature lethality was observed in global Carmn KO and inducible SMC-specific KO mice due to GI pseudo-obstruction and severe distension of the GI tract, with dysmotility in cecum and colon segments. Histology, GI transit, and muscle myography analysis revealed severe dilation, significantly delayed GI transit, and impaired GI contractility in Carmn KO vs control mice. Bulk RNA-seq of GI muscularis revealed that loss of Carmn promotes SMC phenotypic switching, as evidenced by up-regulation of extracellular matrix genes and down-regulation of SMC contractile genes, including Mylk, a key regulator of SMC contraction. snRNA-seq further revealed SMC Carmn KO not only compromised myogenic motility by reducing contractile gene expression but also impaired neurogenic motility by disrupting cell-cell connectivity in the colonic muscularis. These findings may have translational significance, because silencing CARMN in human colonic SMCs significantly attenuated contractile gene expression, including MYLK, and decreased SMC contractility. Luciferase reporter assays showed that CARMN enhances the transactivation activity of the master regulator of SMC contractile phenotype, myocardin, thereby maintaining the GI SMC myogenic program. Our data suggest that Carmn is indispensable for maintaining GI SMC contractile function in mice and that loss of function of CARMN may contribute to human visceral myopathy. To our knowledge this is the first study showing an essential role of lncRNA in the regulation of visceral SMC phenotype.",

MBD specifically recognizes symmetrical methyl-CpG on double-stranded DNA; therefore, the methylation level is quantified by measuring the fluorescence intensity of the bound MBD-fused fluorescent protein. We prepared MBD-fused AcGFP1 and quantified the CpG methylation levels of the target DNA against <i>SEPT9</i>, <i>BRCA1</i>, and long interspersed nuclear element-1 (LINE-1) using MBD-AcGFP1.

Map-based cloning and complementation assays confirmed that PGA4 encodes the chloroplast Signal Recognition Particle 54 kDa (cpSRP54) protein. A heterogeneous Light-Harvesting Chlorophyll a/b Binding-Green Fluorescent Protein (LhcB2-GFP) fusion protein was generated as an indicative reporter for cpSRP54-mediated thylakoid translocation. LhcB2-GFP was dysfunctional and degraded to a short-form dLhcB2-GFP during de-etiolation through an N-terminal degradation initiated on thylakoid membranes. Further biochemical and genetic evidence demonstrated that the degradation of LhcB2-GFP to dLhcB2-GFP was disrupted in pga4 and yellow variegated2 (var2) mutants caused by mutations in the Filamentous Temperature-Sensitive H2 (VAR2/AtFtsH2) subunit of thylakoid FtsH.

Furthermore, probe oxidation upon the addition of extracellular peroxides is also quantitatively similar, suggesting comparable plasma membrane H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> gradients. Finally, as a proof of concept, we have applied different concentrations of zinc to all three model systems and have detected probe oxidation, demonstrating that an excess of this metal can cause fluctuations of peroxides, which are moderate in yeasts and severe in mammalian cells. We conclude that the principles governing H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> fluxes are very similar in different model organisms.",

However, the lack of internal controls subject functional bioluminescence to a number of unpredictable variables that reduce this powerful tool to semi-quantitative interpretation of large-scale effects. Here, we report the generation of sensitive and quantitative live reporters for two key measures of functional cancer biology and pharmacologic stress: the cell cycle and oxidative stress. We developed a two-colored readout, where two independent enzymes convert a common imaging substrate into spectrally distinguishable light. The signal intensity of one color is dependent upon the biological state, whereas the other color is constitutively expressed. The ratio of emitted colored light corrects the functional signal for independent procedural variables, substantially improving the robustness and interpretation of relatively low-fold changes in functional signal intensity after drug treatment. The application of these readouts in vitro is highly advantageous, as peak cell response to therapy can now be readily visualized for single or combination treatments and not simply assessed at an arbitrary and destructive timepoint. Spectral imaging in vivo can be challenging, but we also present evidence to show that the reporters can work in this context as well. Collectively, the development and validation of these internally controlled reporters allow researchers to robustly and dynamically visualize tumor cell biology in response to treatment. Given the prevalence of bioluminescence imaging, this presents significant and much needed opportunities for preclinical therapeutic development.",

There is an increasing interest in the use of engineered bacteria as diagnostic and therapeutic tools for gut diseases. In this study, we developed genetic circuits capable of sensing SCFA concentrations to build biosensors that express a response protein (superfolder green fluorescent protein [sfGFP]) in amounts inversely proportional to the SCFA concentration. We also built biotherapeutics expressing the cytokine granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) using the same logic. The propionate biotherapeutic expressed larger amounts of mouse GM-CSF in the absence of propionate. The butyrate biotherapeutics presented the expected behavior only at the beginning of the kinetics and an accelerated response in the absence of butyrate. Overall, these genetic systems may function as complementary diagnostic tools for measuring SCFAs and as delivery vehicles for biotherapeutic molecules. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Short-chain fatty acids are key molecules produced by the gut microbiome.

This can occur by insertion of multiple novel independent transcription units between the ORF sequences of the PRRSV genome. Here, an expression cassette consisting of a red fluorescent protein (RFP) gene flanked at its 3' end by transcription-regulating sequences (TRS) and an expression cassette consisting of an iLOV gene flanked at its 5' end by TRS, was constructed. The resulting expression cassette containing a RFP and an iLOV gene were introduced between ORF1b and 2 as well as ORF7 and 3'UTR, respectively, in an infectious PRRSV cDNA clone. Transfection of the resulting clone (pGX-12RFP-73iLOV) into cells resulted in the recovery of a recombinant virus (rGX-12RFP-73iLOV). Simultaneous expression of RFP and iLOV was observed in MARC-145 cells infected with rGX-RFP-iLOV. To test the ability of the PRRSV genome to express all three reporter genes simultaneously, an expression cassette containing the Gluc gene and one containing the iLOV gene were also inserted in between ORF1b and 2 as well as ORF7 and 3'UTR, respectively. This was performed in a recently obtained infectious PRRSV cDNA clone carrying a RFP gene in nsp2. Transfection of the construct (pGX-R-Gluc-iLOV) carrying the three reporter genes into cells allowed the rescue of the recombinant reporter virus (rGX-R-Gluc-iLOV) which showed similar growth characteristics to the parental virus but yielded 100-fold less infectious viruses. Fluorescence microscopy of cells infected with rGX-R-Gluc-iLOV demonstrated the presence of both RFP and iLOV genes. Gluc activities in supernatants harvested at different time points from cells infected with recombinant viruses carrying Gluc showed increased levels of Gluc activity as the infection progressed. This indicated that Gluc gene as well as its activity were acceptable parameters to monitor viral propagation.

However, so far there is no unifying explanation for why aGPCRs are autoproteolytically processed. Here we introduce a genetically encoded sensor system to detect the dissociation events of aGPCR heterodimers into their constituent N-terminal and C-terminal fragments (NTFs and CTFs, respectively). An NTF release sensor (NRS) of the neural latrophilin-type aGPCR Cirl (ADGRL)<sup>9-11</sup>, from Drosophila melanogaster, is stimulated by mechanical force. Cirl-NRS activation indicates that receptor dissociation occurs in neurons and cortex glial cells. The release of NTFs from cortex glial cells requires trans-interaction between Cirl and its ligand, the Toll-like receptor Tollo (Toll-8)<sup>12</sup>, on neural progenitor cells, whereas expressing Cirl and Tollo in cis suppresses dissociation of the aGPCR. This interaction is necessary to control the size of the neuroblast pool in the central nervous system. We conclude that receptor autoproteolysis enables non-cell-autonomous activities of aGPCRs, and that the dissociation of aGPCRs is controlled by their ligand expression profile and by mechanical force. The NRS system will be helpful in elucidating the physiological roles and signal modulators of aGPCRs, which constitute a large untapped reservoir of drug targets for cardiovascular, immune, neuropsychiatric and neoplastic diseases<sup>13</sup>.",

Herein, we propose a phage-based biosensor method to develop a sensitive and specific system for biomedical detection. Our method is based on in vitro selected phages and their interaction with the targeted analytes as well as on optical properties that change according to the concentration of the model analyte. The green fluorescent protein (GFP) was chosen as our model analyte as it has its own well-known optical properties. Brilliant green was used as a reporter component for the sensor. Its presence enables a color intensity (absorbance) change when the analyte is present in the solution. Furthermore, the reporter dye functioned as a quencher for an additional lanthanide label in our assay. It mediated the specific phage-derived interference in the signal measured with the time-resolved luminescence. Most importantly, our results confirmed that the presented bifunctional phage with its liquid crystal properties enabled the measurement of GFP in a concentration-dependent, quantitative manner with a limit of detection of 0.24 µg/mL. In the future, our novel method to develop phage-based biosensors may provide highly sensitive and specific biosensors for biomedical or otherwise-relevant targets.",

Pirt-GCaMP3-based Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging of primary sensory neurons of the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) in mice offers the advantage of simultaneous measurement of a large number of cells. Up to 1,800 neurons can be monitored, allowing neuronal networks and somatosensory processes to be studied as an ensemble in their normal physiological context at a populational level in vivo. The large number of neurons monitored allows the detection of activity patterns that would be challenging to detect using other methods. Stimuli can be applied to the mouse hindpaw, allowing the direct effects of stimuli on the DRG neuron ensemble to be studied. The number of neurons producing Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients as well as the amplitude of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients indicates sensitivity to specific sensory modalities. The diameter of neurons provides evidence of activated fiber types (non-noxious mechano vs. noxious pain fibers, Aβ, Aδ, and C fibers).

Although it is well-documented that better-than-expected outcomes are encoded quantitatively via midbrain dopaminergic (DA) activity, it has been less addressed experimentally whether worse-than-expected outcomes are expressed quantitatively as well. We show that larger reward expectations upon unexpected reward omissions are associated with the preceding slower rise and following larger decrease (DA dip) in the DA concentration at the ventral striatum of mice. We set up a lever press task on a fixed ratio (FR) schedule requiring five lever presses as an effort for a food reward (FR5). The mice occasionally checked the food magazine without a reward before completing the task. The percentage of this premature magazine entry (PME) increased as the number of lever presses approached five, showing rising expectations with increasing proximity to task completion, and hence greater reward expectations. Fibre photometry of extracellular DA dynamics in the ventral striatum using a fluorescent protein (genetically encoded GPCR activation-based DA sensor: GRAB<sub>DA2m</sub> ) revealed that the slow increase and fast decrease in DA levels around PMEs were correlated with the PME percentage, demonstrating a monotonic relationship between the DA dip amplitude and degree of expectations. Computational modelling of the lever press task implementing temporal difference errors and state transitions replicated the observed correlation between the PME frequency and DA dip amplitude in the FR5 task. Taken together, these findings indicate that the DA dip amplitude represents the degree of reward expectations monotonically, which may guide behavioural adjustment.",

Several types of fluorescent protein-stabilized gold nanoclusters (protein-AuNCs) have been developed for sensitive and easy detection of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. However, its low sensitivity makes is difficult to measure negligible concentrations of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Therefore, to overcome this limitation, we developed a horseradish peroxidase-encapsulated fluorescent bio-nanoparticle (HEFBNP), comprising bovine serum albumin-stabilized gold nanoclusters (BSA-AuNCs) and horseradish peroxidase-stabilized gold nanoclusters (HRP-AuNCs). The fabricated HEFBNP can sensitively detect H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> owing to its two properties. The first is that HEFBNPs have a continuous two-step fluorescence quenching mechanism, which comes from the heterogenous fluorescence quenching mechanism of HRP-AuNCs and BSA-AuNCs. Second, the proximity of two protein-AuNCs in a single HEFBNP allows a reaction intermediate (•OH) to rapidly reach the adjacent protein-AuNCs. As a result, HEFBNP can improve the overall reaction event and decrease the loss of intermediate in the solution. Due to the continuous quenching mechanism and effective reaction event, a HEFBNP-based sensing system can measure very low concentrations of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> up to 0.5 nM and show good selectivity. Furthermore, we design a glass-based microfluidic device to make it easier use HEFBNP, which allowed us to detect H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> with the naked eye.

Measuring the free cellular calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) concentrations <i>in vivo</i> with genetically encodable FPs can be a relatively direct measure of neuronal activity due to the complex signaling role of these ions. REX-GECO1 is a recently developed red-green emission and excitation ratiometric FP-based biosensor that achieves a high dynamic range due to differences in the chromophore response to light excitation with and without calcium ions. Using steady-state electronic measurements (UV/Visible absorption and emission), along with time-resolved spectroscopic techniques including femtosecond transient absorption (fs-TA) and femtosecond stimulated Raman spectroscopy (FSRS), the potential energy surfaces of these unique biosensors are unveiled with vivid details. The ground-state structural characterization of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free biosensor via FSRS reveals a more spacious protein pocket that allows the chromophore to efficiently twist and reach a dark state. In contrast, the more compressed cavity within the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-bound biosensor results in a more heterogeneous distribution of chromophore populations that results in multi-step excited state proton transfer (ESPT) pathways on the sub-140 fs, 600 fs, and 3 ps timescales.

        "abstract": "Many Gram-negative pathogens rely on type IV secretion systems (T4SS) for infection. One limitation has been the lack of ideal reporters to identify T4SS translocated effectors and study T4SS function. Most reporter systems make use of fusions to reporter proteins, in particular, β-lactamase (TEM) and calmodulin-dependent adenylate cyclase (CYA), that allow detection of translocated enzymatic activity inside host cells. However, both systems require costly reagents and use complex, multistep procedures for loading host cells with substrate (TEM) or for analysis (CYA). Therefore, we have developed and characterized a novel reporter system using nanoluciferase (NLuc) fusions to address these limitations. Serendipitously, we discovered that Nluc itself is efficiently translocated by Legionella pneumophila T4SS in an IcmSW chaperone-dependent manner via an N-terminal translocation signal. Extensive mutagenesis in the NLuc N terminus suggested the importance of an α-helical domain spanning D5 to V9, as mutations predicted to disrupt this structure, with one exception, were translocation defective. Notably, NLuc was capable of translocating several proteins examined when fused to the N or C terminus, while maintaining robust luciferase activity. In particular, it delivered the split GFP11 fragment into J774 macrophages transfected with GFPopt, thereby resulting in <i>in vivo</i> assembly of superfolder green fluorescent protein (GFP). This provided a bifunctional assay in which translocation could be assayed by fluorescence microplate, confocal microscopy, and/or luciferase assays. We further identified an optimal NLuc substrate which allowed a robust, inexpensive, one-step, high-throughput screening assay to identify T4SS translocation substrates and inhibitors. Taken together, these results indicate that NLuc provides both new insight into and also tools for studying T4SS biology. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Type IV secretion systems (T4SS) are used by Gram-negative pathogens to coopt host cell function. However, the translocation signals recognized by T4SS are not fully explained by primary amino acid sequence, suggesting yet-to-be-defined contributions of secondary and tertiary structure. Here, we unexpectedly identified nanoluciferase (NLuc) as an efficient IcmSW-dependent translocated T4SS substrate, and we provide extensive mutagenesis data suggesting that the first N-terminal, alpha-helix domain is a critical translocation recognition motif. Notably, most existing reporter systems for studying translocated proteins make use of fusions to reporters to permit detection of translocated enzymatic activity inside the host cell. However, existing systems require extremely costly substrates, complex technical procedures to isolate eukaryotic cytoplasm for analysis, and/or are insensitive. Importantly, we found that NLuc provides a powerful, cost-effective new tool to address these limitations and facilitate high-throughput exploration of secretion system biology.",

        "abstract": "Although several mechanisms of macroautophagy/autophagy have been dissected in the last decade, following this pathway in real time remains challenging. Among the early events leading to its activation, the ATG4B protease primes the key autophagy player MAP1LC3B/LC3B. Given the lack of reporters to follow this event in living cells, we developed a Förster's resonance energy transfer (FRET) biosensor responding to the priming of LC3B by ATG4B. The biosensor was generated by flanking LC3B within a pH-resistant donor-acceptor FRET pair, Aquamarine-tdLanYFP. We here showed that the biosensor has a dual readout. First, FRET indicates the priming of LC3B by ATG4B and the resolution of the FRET image makes it possible to characterize the spatial heterogeneity of the priming activity. Second, quantifying the number of Aquamarine-LC3B puncta determines the degree of autophagy activation. We then showed that there are pools of unprimed LC3B upon <i>ATG4B</i> downregulation, and the priming of the biosensor is abolished in <i>ATG4B</i> knockout cells. The lack of priming can be rescued with the wild-type ATG4B or with the partially active W142A mutant, but not with the catalytically dead C74S mutant. Moreover, we screened for commercially-available ATG4B inhibitors, and illustrated their differential mode of action by implementing a spatially-resolved, broad-to-sensitive analysis pipeline combining FRET and the quantification of autophagic puncta. Finally, we uncovered the CDK1-dependent regulation of the ATG4B-LC3B axis at mitosis. Therefore, the LC3B FRET biosensor paves the way for a highly-quantitative monitoring of the ATG4B activity in living cells and in real time, with unprecedented spatiotemporal resolution.<b>Abbreviations:</b> Aqua: aquamarine; ATG: autophagy related; AURKA: aurora kinase A; BafA<sub>1</sub>: bafilomycin A<sub>1</sub>; CDK1: cyclin dependent kinase 1; DKO: double knockout; FLIM: fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy; FP: fluorescence protein; FRET: Förster's resonance energy transfer; GABARAP: GABA type A receptor-associated protein; HBSS: Hanks' balanced salt solution; KO: knockout; LAMP2: lysosomal associated membrane protein 2; MAP1LC3/LC3: microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3; NSC: NSC 185058; PE: phosphatidylethanolamine; SKO: single knockout; TKO: triple knockout; ULK1: unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase 1; WT: wild-type; ZPCK: <i>Z-L</i>-phe chloromethyl ketone.",

However, due to the fact that the PAM cells can only be obtained from primary tissues, research on PAM-based virus-host interactions remains challenging. The improvement of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) technology provides a new strategy to develop IPSCs-derived PAM cells. Since the CD163 is a macrophage-specific marker and a validated receptor essential for PRRSV infection, generation of stable porcine induced pluripotent stem cells lines containing CD163 reporter system play important roles in the investigation of IPSCs-PAM transition and PAM-based virus-host interaction. Based on the CRISPR/Cas9- mediated gene editing system, we designed a sgRNA targeting CD163 locus and constructed the corresponding donor vectors. To test whether this reporter system has the expected function, the reporter system was introduced into primary PAM cells to detect the expression of RFP. To validate the low effect on stem cell pluripotency, we generated porcine iPSC lines containing CD163 reporter and assessed the pluripotency through multiple assays such as alkaline phosphatase staining, immunofluorescent staining, and EdU staining. The red-fluorescent protein (RFP) expression was detected in CD163-edited PAM cells, suggesting that our reporter system indeed has the ability to reflect the expression of gene <i>CD163</i>. Compared with wild-type (WT) iPSCs, the CD163 reporter-iPSCs display similar pluripotency-associated transcription factors expression. Besides, cells with the reporter system showed consistent cell morphology and proliferation ability as compared to WT iPSCs, indicating that the edited-cells have no effect on stem cell pluripotency. In conclusion, we generated porcine iPSCs that contain a CD163 reporter system. Our results demonstrated that this reporter system was functional and safe.

As a model experiment, we aimed to modify the substrate specificity of XylM<i>,</i> a rate-determining enzyme in a multistep oxidation reaction catalyzed by XylMABC in <i>Pseudomonas putida</i>. XylMABC naturally converts toluene and xylene to benzoic acid and toluic acid, respectively. We aimed to engineer XylM to improve its conversion efficiency to a non-native substrate, 2,6-xylenol. Wild-type XylMABC slightly converted 2,6-xylenol to 3-methylsalicylic acid, which is the ligand of the transcriptional regulator XylS in <i>P. putida</i>. By locating a fluorescent protein gene under the control of the <i>Pm</i> promoter to which XylS binds, a XylS-producing <i>Escherichia coli</i> strain showed higher fluorescence intensity in a 3-methylsalicylic acid concentration-dependent manner. We evaluated the 3-methylsalicylic acid productivity of XylM variants using the fluorescence intensity of the sensor strain as an indicator. The obtained data provided the training data for machine learning for the directed evolution of XylM. Two cycles of machine learning-assisted directed evolution resulted in the acquisition of XylM-D140E-V144K-F243L-N244S with 15 times higher productivity than wild-type XylM. These results demonstrate that an indirect enzyme activity evaluation method using biosensors is sufficiently quantitative and high-throughput to be used as training data for machine learning. The findings expand the versatility of machine learning in enzyme engineering.",

However, conventional GEVIs perturb membrane integrity through inserting multiple copies of transmembrane domains into the plasma membrane. To circumvent large add-ons to the plasma membrane, we used a minimally invasive novel hybrid dark quencher GEVI to record the physiological and pathological firing patterns of hiPSCs-derived sensory neurons from patients with inherited erythromelalgia, a chronic pain condition associated with recurrent attacks of redness and swelling in the distal extremities. We observed considerable differences in action potential firing patterns between patient and control neurons that were previously overlooked with other recording methods. Our system also performed well in hiPSC-derived forebrain neurons where it detected spontaneous synchronous bursting behavior, thus opening the path to future applications in other cell types and disease models including Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, and schizophrenia, conditions associated with disturbances of neuronal activity and synchrony.",

Sensitive genetically-encoded fluorescent glutamate reporters operating with a range of affinities and emission wavelengths are available. However, without targeting to synapses, the specificity of the fluorescent signal is uncertain, compared to sensors directed at vesicles or other synaptic markers. We fused the state-of-the-art reporter iGluSnFR to glutamate receptor auxiliary proteins in order to target it to postsynaptic sites. Chimeras of Stargazin and gamma-8 that we named SnFR-γ2 and SnFR-γ8, were enriched at synapses, retained function and reported spontaneous glutamate release in rat hippocampal cells, with apparently diffraction-limited spatial precision. In autaptic mouse neurons cultured on astrocytic microislands, evoked neurotransmitter release could be quantitatively detected at tens of synapses in a field of view whilst evoked currents were recorded simultaneously. These experiments revealed a specific postsynaptic deficit from Stargazin overexpression, resulting in synapses with normal neurotransmitter release but without postsynaptic responses. This defect was reverted by delaying overexpression. By working at different calcium concentrations, we determined that SnFR-γ2 is a linear reporter of the global quantal parameters and short-term synaptic plasticity, whereas iGluSnFR is not. On average, half of iGluSnFR regions of interest (ROIs) showing evoked fluorescence changes had intense rundown, whereas less than 5% of SnFR-γ2 ROIs did. We provide an open-source analysis suite for extracting quantal parameters including release probability from fluorescence time series of individual and grouped synaptic responses.

Additionally, the properties of biosensors developed based on the promoter regions of <i>mntS</i>, <i>mntH</i>, and <i>mntP</i> were investigated. MntR represses the transcription of MntS and MntH after binding with Mn(II), while it induces MntP transcription.

        "abstract": "Oxytocin (OT), a peptide hormone and neuromodulator, is involved in diverse physiological and pathophysiological processes in the central nervous system and the periphery. However, the regulation and functional sequences of spatial OT release in the brain remain poorly understood. We describe a genetically encoded G-protein-coupled receptor activation-based (GRAB) OT sensor called GRAB<sub>OT1.0</sub>. In contrast to previous methods, GRAB<sub>OT1.0</sub> enables imaging of OT release ex vivo and in vivo with suitable sensitivity, specificity and spatiotemporal resolution. Using this sensor, we visualize stimulation-induced OT release from specific neuronal compartments in mouse brain slices and discover that N-type calcium channels predominantly mediate axonal OT release, whereas L-type calcium channels mediate somatodendritic OT release. We identify differences in the fusion machinery of OT release for axon terminals versus somata and dendrites. Finally, we measure OT dynamics in various brain regions in mice during male courtship behavior. Thus, GRAB<sub>OT1.0</sub> provides insights into the role of compartmental OT release in physiological and behavioral functions.",
