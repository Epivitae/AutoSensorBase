        "abstract": "Monitoring intracellular calcium is central to understanding cell signaling across nearly all cell types and organisms. Fluorescent genetically encoded calcium indicators (GECIs) remain the standard tools for in vivo calcium imaging, but require intense excitation light, leading to photobleaching, background autofluorescence and phototoxicity. Bioluminescent GECIs, which generate light enzymatically, eliminate these artifacts but have been constrained by low dynamic range and suboptimal calcium affinities. Here we show that CaBLAM ('calcium bioluminescence activity monitor'), an engineered bioluminescent calcium indicator, achieves an order-of-magnitude improvement in signal contrast and a tunable affinity matched to physiological cytosolic calcium. CaBLAM enables single-cell and subcellular activity imaging at video frame rates in cultured neurons and sustained imaging over hours in awake, behaving animals. These capabilities establish CaBLAM as a robust and general alternative to fluorescent GECIs, extending calcium imaging to regimes where excitation light is undesirable or infeasible.",

        "abstract": "Calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) signaling plays a pivotal role in determining B cell fate, shaping processes such as activation, differentiation, anergy or apoptosis. Upon B cell antigen receptor activation, Ca<sup>2+</sup> is rapidly mobilized from the endoplasmic reticulum and supplemented by Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx from the extracellular space, ultimately driving activation of various signaling pathways required for appropriate B cell responses. Although mitochondria also harbor significant levels of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, how mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics are regulated in B cells in response to activation or other cues remains unknown, as do the functional consequences of altered mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels. Chemical dyes as well as a genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor with a mitochondrial targeting sequence were used to study mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics in response to various stimuli. Proximity ligation assays were performed to assess interaction between mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum. Primary mouse B cells and the Burkitt lymphoma cell line Ramos were used to study functional consequences of the loss of the Mitochondrial Calcium Uniporter. Here, we show that mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels dynamically respond to cell activation, stress and metabolic cues and that mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake is largely dependent on the Mitochondrial Calcium Uniporter. Reduced mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake has a negative impact on mitochondrial activity and also affects cell signaling. These findings demonstrate that changes in mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> contribute to shaping functional B cell responses. The spatial and temporal dynamics of Ca<sup>2+</sup> accumulation within distinct subcellular compartments, particularly the cytosol, endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria, are essential for translating extracellular and intracellular signals into specific cellular outcomes. Our study provides new insights into the regulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis in B cells.",

However, these sensors are generally optimized for exponential growth rather than stationary phase where production occurs. Here, we find that our previously engineered E. coli green light sensor CcaSR, which functions robustly in exponential phase, fails in stationary phase due to spontaneous loss of an engineered chromophore biosynthetic pathway and accumulation of CcaS and CcaR. We optimize the genetic context and expression determinants of each component, resulting in a stable system named CcaSR<sub>stat</sub> that imposes little metabolic burden, exhibits low leakiness and an 80-fold green light response, and functions exclusively in stationary phase. We combine CcaSR<sub>stat</sub>-driven enzyme expression with varied static and periodic illumination patterns to achieve high titers of the industrially-relevant phenylpropanoid p-Coumaric acid and demonstrate that these optimizations scale to benchtop bioreactor conditions. Finally, we use CcaSR<sub>stat</sub> to optimize the expression level of a co-transcribed multi-enzyme metabolic pathway encoding production of plant-derived betaxanthin family pigments.

Cholinergic signaling in the striatum contributes to such flexible behavior, yet the timing and spatial organization of acetylcholine release during contingency changes remain unclear, limiting conceptual understanding of its role in behavioral flexibility. Using a genetically encoded acetylcholine sensor and 2-photon imaging in the dorsal striatum of behaving mice, we visualized acetylcholine dynamics during acquisition and reversal learning in a virtual reality Y-maze. Rewarded outcomes evoked phasic decreases in acetylcholine, whereas unexpected non-reward following reversal triggered widespread increases that predicted lose-shift behavior. Targeted inhibition of cholinergic interneurons reduced this adaptive response. Spatial analysis revealed heterogeneous, temporally distinct signals forming functionally diverse microdomains. These findings suggest that widespread and focal acetylcholine release during unexpected outcomes promotes adaptive response shifts, offering a mechanistic framework for understanding disorders such as addiction and obsessive-compulsive rituals.",

Here, we show that acid-sensing ion channel 3 (ASIC3) dramatically delays leukemogenesis. Asic3 deletion results in a remarkably enhanced self-renewal, reduced differentiation, and 9-fold greater number of murine acute myeloid LICs. We developed an ultrasensitive, ratiometric, genetically encoded fluorescent pH sensor (pHluorin3) and demonstrated that LICs prefer localizing in the endosteal niche with a neutral pH range of 7.34-7.42, but not in the vascular niche with a lower pH range of 6.89-7.22. Unexpectedly, acid-ASIC3 signaling inhibits both murine and human LIC activities in a noncanonical manner by interacting with the N-terminal of STIM1 to reduce calcium-mediated CAMK1-CREB-MEIS1-LDHA levels, without inducing cation currents. This study reveals a pathway in suppression of leukemogenesis in the acidic BM niche and provides insight into targeting LICs or other cancer stem cells through pH-dependent ASICs.",

        "abstract": "Myasthenia gravis is a rare autoimmune disease mediated by autoantibodies directed against acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) at the neuromuscular junction. These autoantibodies cause dysfunction through AChR blockade, AChR degradation due to crosslinking and internalisation, and complement activation. A novel in vitro model of the human neuromuscular junction was established on a microfluidic platform to investigate the effect of anti-AChR autoantibodies on complement activation and neuromuscular transmission and the mechanism of action of complement inhibition in myasthenia gravis. The NeuroMuscle<sup>TM</sup> platform enabled the connection of human induced pluripotent stem-cell-derived motor neuron spheroids with three-dimensional cultures of skeletal muscle fibres, forming functional neuromuscular junctions. Functional connectivity was assessed by glutamate stimulation of motor neuron spheroids and monitoring of calcium transients in genetically encoded calcium indicator protein 6 (GCaMP6)-transduced muscle fibres. Incubation of in vitro neuromuscular junction tissues with sera from patients with anti-AChR autoantibody-positive myasthenia gravis, in contrast to healthy controls, induced a significant increase in membrane attack complex (MAC) deposition and complement split products, accompanied by a notable reduction in calcium transients. Treatment with zilucoplan, a complement component 5 (C5) inhibitor, prevented complement activation and preserved neuromuscular junction functional integrity. The model demonstrated that complement-mediated damage is a major driver of neuromuscular junction functional impairment in the myasthenia gravis patient sera tested in this study. Furthermore, the study explored the reversibility of neuromuscular junction damage, revealing that shortening the delay before initiating complement inhibitor treatment in the in vitro neuromuscular junction tissues enhances the reversibility of neuromuscular transmission. These findings offer a mechanistic rationale for the observed clinical response in patients with anti-AChR autoantibody-positive myasthenia gravis treated with C5 inhibitors. The in vitro neuromuscular junction model provides a robust platform for studying the mechanistic pathways of complement-mediated damage and evaluating therapeutic interventions for myasthenia gravis.",

        "abstract": "Mitochondrial dysfunction and defective mitophagy are defining features of numerous neurodegenerative and metabolic disorders, yet existing tools provide limited ability to quantify mitophagy dynamics in real time within living, post-mitotic cells. Here we present MitoFlare, a mitochondria-targeted, reversible mtROS-responsive fluorogenic probe that enables continuous, non-genetic visualization of mitochondrial oxidative activation and turnover. MitoFlare incorporates dual TEMPO nitroxide quenchers into a long-wavelength rhodamine scaffold, producing >95% basal quenching and rapid, fully reversible fluorescence activation in response to mitochondrial superoxide, hydroxyl radicals, lipid-derived peroxyl species, and peroxynitrite. When combined with LysoTracker Green, MitoFlare forms a dual-probe imaging platform that resolves the entire mitophagy cascade with high spatial and temporal fidelity in intact PC12 neuronal cells. Using this platform, we established a quantitative framework comprising three mechanistically distinct metrics: (i) a proximity index that reports early mitochondrial engagement with lysosomes, (ii) Manders' M1 coefficient that captures mid-stage mitochondria-lysosome fusion and mitophagosome formation, and (iii) a quenching/swelling index that resolves terminal lysosomal degradation. Nutrient deprivation induced a complete, temporally ordered mitophagy program, including mtROS priming, Parkin-OPTN-associated fusion, and efficient acidification-dependent cargo degradation. In contrast, inhibition of v-ATPase with bafilomycin A1 arrested mitophagy at the fusion stage, resulting in persistent redox-active mitochondrial cargo that failed to undergo lysosomal digestion. Importantly, MitoFlare's reversible redox chemistry uniquely revealed accumulation of undegraded, oxidatively active mitochondrial remnants within non-acidified vesicles-pathological intermediates that are undetectable using irreversible ROS dyes or genetically encoded reporters. These findings demonstrate that mitophagy proceeds through discrete, redox-regulated and lysosome-dependent phases that can be quantitatively mapped in real time. By enabling synchronized measurement of oxidative activation, organelle trafficking, fusion, and degradation, the MitoFlare-LysoTracker system establishes a new benchmark for dynamic mitophagy analysis in physiologically relevant models. This platform provides a powerful foundation for mechanistic interrogation of mitochondrial quality control and for accelerating the discovery of therapeutic strategies aimed at restoring mitophagic fidelity in neurodegenerative, cardiovascular, and metabolic diseases.",

        "abstract": "Voltage-sensing phosphatases (VSPs) provide a conserved framework for dissecting the mechanics of voltage sensing and for engineering genetically encoded voltage indicators (GEVIs). To evaluate how natural sequence diversity shapes function, we compared VSP voltage-sensing domains (VSDs) from multiple species by replacing the phosphatase domain with a fluorescent protein to enable optical detection of VSD responses. Every construct that reached the plasma membrane produced a voltage-dependent optical signal, underscoring the deep conservation of voltage sensing across VSP orthologs. Yet lineage-specific substitutions generated strikingly different phenotypes. A plankton VSP ortholog from <i>Eurytemora carolleeae</i> and the Sea Hare (<i>Aplysia californica</i>) VSP exhibited left-shifted activation ranges, producing robust fluorescence transitions during modest depolarizations of the plasma membrane. The human VSD of hVSP2 yielded weak, sluggish responses with poor recovery, but reintroduction of a conserved arginine in S1 (G95R) partially restored reversibility, implicating lipid-facing residues in conformational stability. The Chinese hamster (<i>Cricetulus griseus</i>) VSD, with atypical S4 sensing charges (RWIR), generated a slow fluorescence increase during depolarization, while reverting to the consensus arginine (RRIR) inverted the polarity to a decrease. These contrasting behaviors show that single residue changes can reshape how VSD movements influence the fluorescent reporter, highlighting the molecular precision revealed by GEVI measurements. Together, these results show that voltage-dependent signaling is deeply conserved across VSPs but shaped by lineage-specific sequence variation, establishing VSPs as powerful models for probing voltage sensing and guiding GEVI design.",

Methods based on radioactive [3H]-GABA uptake come with significant regulatory concerns, cost, and workflow complexity, which could be resolved by an alternate assay. To address this issue, we developed a high-content fluorescence imaging assay of GAT-1-mediated GABA uptake using a genetically encoded GABA sensor, iGABA-Snfr. We demonstrated that pathogenic variants strongly reduced uptake (mean, -89.4% [95% CI, -71.5% to -107.3%]).

The ER is surrounded by a membrane that separates its lumen from the cytoplasm. The ER membrane harbors channels and pumps capable of controlling ion flux and creating a voltage gradient. Because the ER membrane potential is difficult to study experimentally little is known about how voltage influences its many vital functions. Here we introduce optical probes of ER membrane potential derived from the hybrid voltage sensor (hVoS) family of genetically-encoded voltage sensors. Probes were targeted to the ER using motifs from three ER proteins, Sec61β, cytochrome P450, and cytochrome b<sub>5</sub> type A. As shown recently with other types of ER voltage sensors, patch-clamp fluorometry recording with our new probes demonstrated that voltage steps applied to the plasma membrane elicit a voltage change at the ER membrane. These probes exhibited subtle differences in their responses suggesting they target different ER compartments. The steeper voltage dependence of Sec61β-hVoS (mCerulean3-Sec61β) signals suggested that this probe targets an ER compartment rich in voltage-gated ion channels. The ER voltage change is slow, but its onset is virtually synchronous with the plasma membrane voltage step. This suggests a direct electrical coupling into the ER lumen through plasma membrane-ER contacts. Analysis with the aid of an equivalent circuit provided an estimate of the resistance of these contacts. The rapid, direct transmission of voltage changes from the plasma membrane to the ER provides a mechanism for regulating ER function that could be especially important in excitable cells. The sensors introduced here provide researchers with powerful tools for imaging ER voltage and assessing its impact on cellular function.",

A new genetically encoded fluorescent biosensor based on Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) is composed of a JH-binding protein (JHBP) derived from <i>Bombyx mori</i>, which is fused with two fluorescent protein pairs (mTFP1 and mVenus) and exhibits a ratiometric readout. The mTFP1-JHBP-mVenus proteins, flanked by the two fluorescent proteins at the N- and C-termini, respectively, exhibited no discernible FRET as a primary FRET JH sensor. This suggests that inducible FRET by JH binding may have been compromised. Optimizing the insertion of mTFP1 into JHBP enabled inducible FRET in the presence of JH. The resulting construct, the FRET JH Indicator Agent (FREJIA), is the first ratiometric, genetically encoded, and fluorescent biosensor for JH detection. FREJIA interacts with the binding protein and emits a resonance energy transfer signal in response to binding to JH I, II, and III and methoprene at nanomolar ranges. FREJIA enables ratiometric imaging of JH III in live mammalian cells. Our results showed that FRET can be applied to the selective and ratiometric monitoring of JH levels.",

Because SA levels and signaling are highly dynamic in space and time, a suite of SA-focused tools, including SA-specific microbial biosensors and SA-responsive transcriptional and chemical reporters, has been developed to study them. This review compares three classes of tools in terms of sensitivity, specificity, temporal resolution, invasiveness, quantifiability, and suitability across species. We describe developing genetically encoded sensors that can directly sense salicylic acid and report it, for example, via a fluorescence resonance energy transfer signal or another real-time output. We offer recommendations on method selection by research goal and plant species, as well as combined protocols (long-term autoluminescence plus local probes/biosensors) for cross-validation. Future work should prioritize substrate-free, quantitative SA reporters deployable in crops and the field; coupled with CRISPR-based editing and screening, these tools would enable reporter-guided discovery of immunity genes and rapid engineering of durable disease resistance.",

In this study, <i>Arabidopsis</i> and rice lines expressing a FLIPPi biosensor were used to monitor cytosolic Pi dynamics in root epidermal cells. Sensor functionality was confirmed by measuring FRET responses to graded Pi supplies, revealing a consistent reduction in FRET ratios with increasing Pi concentrations, reflecting elevated cytosolic Pi levels. Comparisons with a Pi-insensitive FLIPPi variant confirmed the specificity of the observed changes. Furthermore, live imaging demonstrated rapid and dynamic alterations in cytosolic Pi upon treatment with defense-related hormones and elicitors of immune responses supporting a link between Pi signaling and plant immunity. Finally, the application of phosphite, an analog of Pi, altered Pi dynamics in both <i>Arabidopsis</i> and rice, suggesting an interference with Pi accumulation.

A variety of nanozymes have been revealed with the ability to catalyze substrates of oxidoreductases, mostly including peroxidase (POD), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT), and some of them display multienzyme-like properties, which make them highly attractive for biomedical applications. However, the specific manifestations of nanozyemes within cells remain challenging to predict and detect. In this study, we developed a real-time, dynamic, and highly sensitive live-cell biosensor by expressing HyPer7 probe in the cytosol and mitochondria to monitor the cytosolic and mitochondrial H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> dynamics in a leukemia cell line THP-1. The successful expression of the probes in the cytosol and mitochondria was confirmed using confocal fluorescence microscopy. When the THP-1 cells were exposed to exogenous H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, the fluorescence intensity at 525 nm upon excitation with 405 nm lasers (referred to as F405) decreased, while that upon excitation with 488 nm lasers (referred to as F488) increased.

In this study, we developed four fluorescence-based biosensors for inhibitors of protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B), a therapeutic target for cancer and diabetes, and compared their performance in the presence of heterologous terpenoid pathways, a promising source of new inhibitors. When expressed in <i>Escherichia coli</i>, all four could reliably detect an exogenously supplied PTP1B inhibitor, but only one remained functional alongside terpenoid pathways, where pathway-derived stress reduced overall fluorescence. This sensor, which links PTP1B inhibition to the assembly of a split T7 RNA polymerase, exhibited a high dynamic range with minimal toxicity, a common liability of T7-based circuits. Variants of this sensor with different sensitivities to inhibition and stress allowed us to separate the terpenoid pathways that made PTP1B inhibitors from those that did not. Our findings show how pathway-specific stresses (e.g., terpene synthase expression) can alter biosensor signals as strongly as their target analytes and provide a framework for disentangling these confounding effects in high-throughput screens.",

Mutation of H148 to cysteine promotes the neutral phenolic chromophore in the monomer that excites predominantly at ∼400 nm. Homodimerisation <i>via</i> a copper-dependent disulphide bridge switches the chromophore to the charged phenolate that excites at ∼490 nm. The result is a ∼30 fold increase in the fluorescence emission ratio. Homodimerisation kinetics are further improved by optimising the sfGFP homodimer interface, generating the variant termed GFP-diS2. Structures of the monomeric and dimeric GFP-diS2 suggest that charge switching is through peptide bond flipping and the formation of a buried organised water network around the chromophore that spans the interface region. Fusion to a leucine zipper protein dimerisation element greatly increased the GFP-diS2 association rate making it a more effective copper sensor <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> with Cu(i) instigating the signal change quicker and at lower ion concentrations than Cu(ii). Thus, GFP-diS2 provides the framework for generating a sensitive genetically encoded copper sensor and will eventually be adapted to monitor one of the most important protein-protein interactions in biology, homo-oligomerisation.",

Many reporter cell lines were created for generating phenotypic data in assigning the biological impact of large compound libraries. A major requirement of a phenotypic screen is the reporter cell lines for appropriate biomarkers with a good predictive value. Here, we have developed a stable cell expressing TagBFP2-53BP1 as a real-time sensor for DNA damage at the single-cell level that marks 53BP1 foci formation under physiological conditions, as well as toxicant-induced DNA damage. The cells were further engineered to report mitochondrial permeabilization using Smac-RFP, providing a broader application potential for this cellular model. Once the cells are further expressed with the autophagy marker EGFP-LC3, it is possible to image distinct cell fates such as autophagy, mitochondrial permeabilization, and DNA damage at the single-cell level. Using this system, we demonstrate that early cell death induced by telomerase inhibitors involves double-strand breaks and mitochondrial permeabilization. The model also enabled systematic profiling of several toxicants based on clearly noticeable cell fates. The approach of using live single-cell sensors for multiple distinct and diverse phenotypes offers great advantages over independent single-parameter-based assays, with the additional benefit of extracting heterogeneous cell responses over time, revealing more insight into the toxicity and mechanism of action for predictive applications.",

The ER is surrounded by a membrane that separates its lumen from the cytoplasm. The ER membrane harbors channels and pumps capable of controlling ion flux and creating a voltage gradient. Because the ER membrane potential is difficult to study experimentally, little is known about how voltage influences its many vital functions. Here, we introduce optical probes of ER membrane potential derived from the hybrid voltage sensor (hVoS) family of genetically encoded voltage sensors. Probes were targeted to the ER using motifs from three ER proteins, Sec61β, cytochrome P450, and cytochrome b<sub>5</sub> type A. As shown recently with other types of ER voltage sensors, patch-clamp fluorometry recording with our new probes demonstrated that voltage steps applied to the plasma membrane elicit a voltage change at the ER membrane. These probes exhibited subtle differences in their responses suggesting they target different ER compartments. The steeper voltage dependence of Sec61β-hVoS (mCerulean3-Sec61β) signals suggested that this probe targets an ER compartment rich in voltage-gated ion channels. The ER voltage change is slow, but its onset is virtually synchronous with the plasma membrane voltage step. This suggests a direct electrical coupling into the ER lumen through plasma membrane-ER contacts. Analysis with the aid of an equivalent circuit provided an estimate of the resistance of these contacts. The rapid, direct transmission of voltage changes from the plasma membrane to the ER provides a mechanism for regulating ER function that could be especially important in excitable cells. The sensors introduced here provide researchers with powerful tools for imaging ER voltage and assessing its impact on cellular function.",

        "abstract": "Many genetically encoded voltage indicators (GEVIs) rely on fluorescent protein (FP) domains to report changes in membrane potential. Rapid and reversible disruption of steady-state fluorescence during voltage sensor activation revealed transient conformational changes near the chromophore in the FP domain, implicating chromophore flexibility as a potential mechanism of signal modulation. Substitution of a bulky phenylalanine near the chromophore with threonine (F165T) introduced a distinct secondary component in the fluorescence response, consistent with increased chromophore mobility. This effect was tunable: an external, directionally polarized offset (164<i>T</i>/166F) reoriented the internal threonine side chain, restoring steric hindrance and eliminating the secondary signal. Thus, threonine can function as a context-sensitive molecular switch shaped by β-can surface chemistry. A second internal threonine (T203) also acted as a molecular switch under modified external conditions, generating a secondary signal that is susceptible to membrane curvature during depolarization suggesting that plasma membrane geometry can modulate GEVI activity under permissive conformational states. Crystal structures of Super Ecliptic pHluorin (SE), SE A227D, and a new FP variant revealed that external residues can influence internal side chain orientation. In the new variant, pH-dependent rearrangement of the seventh β-strand dramatically repositions D147 from the interior interacting with the chromophore to the external surface, while H148 shifts from the exterior to interact with the chromophore in alkaline conditions. These insights led to the development of a new GEVI, Ulla, which inverts the polarity of the optical signal─becoming brighter upon depolarization─displays reduced pH sensitivity in the physiological range, and performs reliably under low-light, high-speed imaging conditions in vitro and in vivo using widefield and 2-photon microscopy. Together, these findings present a new approach to modulating chromophore behavior offering broad potential for FP-based biosensor development.",

While iron regulatory proteins (IRPs) function as RNA-binding proteins during iron-limiting conditions and reflect cellular iron status, we lack genetically-encodeable tools to quantify bioavailable intracellular iron status over developmental time and at single-cell resolution. In order to better understand the cellular environment that supports or restricts IRP-active conditions, particularly during complex and dynamic changes leading to differentiated states, we present a ratiometric genetically-encoded biosensor called FEOX. FEOX is a ratiometric fluorescent biosensor of the cellular iron environment based on a mammalian hemerythrin-like domain, acting as an iron-dependent ligand-based regulatory switch. Compared to increased IRP activity in response to iron-limitation, FEOX dynamics demonstrate decreased ratiometric fluorescence representing decreased cellular iron during iron-limitation. Using FEOX we are able to quantify the dynamics of the bioavailable cellular iron environment during early stem cell differentiation by ratiometric measurements at single-cell resolution. Results from FEOX and from an IRP activity sensor during stem cell pluripotency transition and early differentiation provide orthogonal support for an increased iron demand state. Using these genetically-encodeable tools will allow greater insight into cellular iron homeostasis within mammalian systems. IRPs function as RNA-binding proteins during iron-limiting conditions, regulating the stability and translation of messenger RNAs that are essential for cellular iron homeostasis. However, to better understand and study the cell and molecular regulators of the iron-limiting conditions required for IRP RNA-binding activity, new tools are needed to monitor iron-responsive alterations in the intracellular environment at single-cell resolution and over developmental time. We devised a genetically-encoded biosensor called FEOX that depends on molecular iron interactions independent of IRP function and directly gauges bioavailable cellular iron.",

We originally reported a genetically encoded, fluorescent protein-based Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) biosensor that can detect micromolar levels of extracellular ATP. Through mutagenesis of the ATP binding site and optimization of cell-surface display, here we report the development of a second-generation biosensor called ECATS2 with greater than three-fold higher affinity for extracellular ATP. We found that the tether length between the FRET biosensor and the cell surface anchor is critical to optimization of its performance.

        "abstract": "Dopamine (DA) is a critical neurotransmitter that regulates many physiological and behavioral processes. The central dopaminergic system plays a pivotal role in modulating general anesthesia (GA). DA release in the brain is mainly concentrated in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), prefrontal cortex, hypothalamus, and dorsal striatum. Several NAc neuron subtypes are essential for modulating states of consciousness during GA. However, whether NAc DA signal dynamics correlate with different states of consciousness under sevoflurane anesthesia remains to be elucidated. In this study, we measured the dynamic fluctuations of NAc DA levels throughout sevoflurane anesthesia to verify its role. An intensity-based genetically encoded DA indicator, dLight1.1, was employed to track DA release in the NAc. Fiber photometry combined with electroencephalogram/electromyogram recordings was employed to synchronously track NAc DA signal dynamics across different states of consciousness under sevoflurane anesthesia. Under 2.5% sevoflurane exposure, DA release in the NAc significantly increased during the initial 100 s of sevoflurane induction, which was designated as sevo on-1 (mean ± standard error of the mean [SEM]; baseline vs. sevo on-1, <i>p</i> = 0.0261), and continued to decrease in the subsequent anesthesia maintenance phases (sevo on-1 vs. sevo on-4, <i>p</i> = 0.0070). Following the cessation of sevoflurane administration (with intervals denoted as sevooff), NAc DA gradually returned to baseline levels (sevo on-1 vs. sevo off-1, <i>p</i> = 0.0096; sevo on-1 vs. sevo off-3, <i>p</i> = 0.0490; sevo on-1 vs. sevo off-4, <i>p</i> = 0.0059; sevo on-4 vs. sevo off-4, <i>p</i> = 0.0340; sevo off-1 vs. sevo off-4, <i>p</i> = 0.0451). During the induction phase, NAc DA signal dynamics markedly increased during the pre-loss of consciousness (LOC) period (pre-anesthesia baseline vs. pre-LOC, <i>p</i> = 0.0329) and significantly declined after LOC (pre-LOC vs. post-LOC, <i>p</i> = 0.0094). For the emergence period, NAc DA release exhibited a noticeable increase during the initial period after recovery of consciousness (ROC) (anesthesia baseline vs. post-ROC, <i>p</i> = 0.0103; pre-ROC vs. post-ROC, <i>p</i> = 0.0086). Furthermore, the DA signals peaked rapidly upon the initiation of the burst wave and then gradually attenuated, indicating a positive correlation with the burst wave onset during burst suppression events. Our findings revealed that NAc DA neurotransmitter signal dynamics correlate with different states of consciousness throughout sevoflurane anesthesia.",

To elucidate the dynamic role of α-MSH release in regulating appetite, specific, sensitive, and spatiotemporally resolved genetic sensors are required. The melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) scaffold was leveraged for its robust plasma membrane expression, high affinity for melanocortins and low affinity for AgRP to design a α-MSH selective sensor for in vivo use. This was achieved by integrating circularly permuted green fluorescent protein (cpGFP) into the receptor, which we named Fluorescence Amplified Receptor sensor for Melanocortin (FLARE<sub>MC</sub>). The FLARE<sub>MC</sub> sensor has high potency and selectivity in heterologous and homologous expressing cells for α-MSH and the synthetic melanocortin agonist MTII but not to the inverse agonist AgRP. The sensor exhibited impaired signaling, with reduced G protein activation, no β-arrestin coupling, and failed to internalize upon agonist stimulation. In vitro, FLARE<sub>MC</sub> displayed high photostability and reversible photoactivation. These properties suggest that the FLARE<sub>MC</sub> is suitable for long-term activity recording in the brain without desensitizing or interfering with endogenous melanocortin receptor signaling. When expressed in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the mouse hypothalamus, the primary site of anorexigenic α-MSH signaling, FLARE<sub>MC</sub> demonstrated its effectiveness in detecting changes associated with melanocortin responses in vivo. FLARE<sub>MC</sub> enables the study of melanocortin system in cultured cells and in vivo. This first of its class highly sensitive melanocortin sensor will serve as a valuable tool to advance our understanding of the complex dynamics governing melanocortin-dependent appetite regulation and related processes in the brain.",

However, due to limitations such as poor probe permeability and cytotoxicity associated with conventional antibody-based or genetically encoded labeling techniques, live-cell imaging remains a significant challenging. To address these limitations, here in this study, we developed and rigorously validated a novel aptamer-based fluorescent probe for real-time imaging of NEK9 kinase in living cells. First, through <i>in vitro</i> capture-SELEX, a DNA aptamer termed as Apt-011 which could selectively bind NEK9 was identified. Further, capitalizing on the small size, low immunogenicity, and synthetic flexibility of aptamers, we engineered a \"signal-on\" NEK9-specific aptamer-based fluorescent probe platform. This design leverages the aptamer's target--induced conformational change to physically separate the fluorophore-quencher pair, and it has been validated that this fluorescent probe platform could successfully visualize intracellular NEK9 in live-cells without obvious cytotoxicity (cell viability > 95% at working concentrations), offering new opportunities to study NEK9-associated signaling pathways. This work not only provides a robust tool for kinase research but also establishes a generalizable strategy to overcome key bottlenecks in live-cell imaging through rational aptamer engineering.",

        "abstract": "Agonist-induced interaction of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) with β-arrestins (βarrs) is a critical mechanism that regulates the spatiotemporal pattern of receptor localization and signaling. While the underlying mechanism governing GPCR-βarr interaction is primarily conserved and involves receptor activation and phosphorylation, there are several examples of receptor-specific fine-tuning of βarr-mediated functional outcomes. Considering the key contribution of conformational plasticity of βarrs in driving receptor-specific functional responses, it is important to develop novel sensors capable of reporting distinct βarr conformations in cellular context. Here, we design an intrabody version of a βarr-recognizing nanobody (nanobody32), referred to as intrabody32 (Ib32), in NanoLuc enzyme complementation assay format and measure its ability to recognize βarr1 and 2 in live cells upon activation of a broad set of GPCRs. Ib32 robustly recognizes activated βarr1 and 2 in the plasma membrane and endosomes, and effectively mirrors βarr recruitment profile upon stimulation of selected GPCRs. We also design an Ib32 sensor for polarization microscopy with a change in linear dichroism as readout and demonstrate its utility for monitoring βarr activation upon stimulation of selected GPCRs by natural and biased agonists. Taken together with a previously described sensor of βarr1 activation, Ib32 underscores the inherent flexibility encoded in βarrs and conformational diversity imparted by different GPCRs, which is further corroborated using an orthogonal limited proteolysis assay. Our study presents Ib32 as a sensor of βarr activation and highlights the structural diversity of βarrs, which likely allows their ability to interact with, and regulate, a large repertoire of GPCRs.",

However, it has remained difficult to measure intracellular H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> with high specificity and in a quantitative manner. Here, we present a detailed protocol for a chemogenetic method that enables the detection and quantitation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in living cells by converting intracellular H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> into fluorescent or luminescent signals. This is achieved by expressing the engineered heme peroxidase APEX2 in cells and subcellular locations of interest and by providing an appropriate fluorogenic or luminogenic substrate from outside. This method differs fundamentally from previously developed genetically encoded H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> probes; those are reversible and measure the balance between probe thiol oxidation and reduction. By contrast, APEX2 turns over its substrate irreversibly and therefore directly measures endogenous H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> availability. Our detailed step-by-step protocol covers the generation of APEX2-expressing cell lines, the implementation of fluorescent and luminescent measurements and examples for application. Ectopic expression of APEX2 can be achieved in 3 days, while the actual measurements typically require 1-2 h. This protocol is intended for entry-level scientists.",

        "abstract": "Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD), caused by perinatal alcohol exposure (PeAE) and prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE), is characterized by significant cognitive impairments, including reduced cognitive flexibility. Despite the critical role of cholinergic interneurons (CINs) in the dorsomedial striatum (DMS) for cognitive and behavioral flexibility, their contribution to neurobehavioral deficits in FASD remains unclear. To address this gap, this research explored the impact of PeAE and PAE on CIN populations and activity, cognitive flexibility, and compulsive drinking behaviors in adult offspring. We first assessed CIN number by staining striatal sections for choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) and observed a significant reduction in CINs within the posterior striatum of adult PeAE offspring. Functional assessments revealed that PeAE and PAE markedly decreased CIN firing activity and reduced acetylcholine (ACh) release in the DMS, as measured by electrophysiology recordings and live-tissue confocal imaging using a genetically encoded ACh sensor. Behaviorally, PeAE offspring exhibited a significant deficit in adapting to reversed action-outcome contingencies despite intact initial learning capabilities. Moreover, PeAE mice exhibited compulsive alcohol drinking behavior, characterized by elevated consumption and preference for quinine-adulterated alcohol. These findings collectively highlight the critical role of impaired cholinergic signaling in the cognitive and behavioral deficits observed following PeAE and PAE. Understanding this cholinergic dysfunction provides valuable insights necessary for developing targeted interventions aimed at mitigating cognitive and behavioral consequences associated with FASD.",

Specifically, the ventral tegmental area (VTA), the dopaminergic hub of the reward pathways located deep within the midbrain, is crucial for regulating the release of dopamine (DA) throughout the central nervous system (CNS). To better understand the nuances among chronic pain, VTA response, and therapeutics, implementing progressive approaches for mapping and visualizing the deep brain in real time during nociceptive stimulation is crucial. In this study, we utilize a fluorescence imaging platform with a genetically encoded calcium indicator (GCaMP6s) to directly visualize activity in the VTA during acute nociceptive stimulation in both healthy adult mice and adult mice with partial nerve ligation (PNL)-induced neuropathic pain. We also investigate the visualization of the analgesic properties of morphine. Deep brain imaging using our self-fabricated µ-complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) imaging device allows the tracking of the VTA's response to adverse stimuli. Our findings show that nociceptive stimulation is associated with a reduction in VTA fluorescence activity, supporting the potential of this platform for visualizing pain-related responses in the central nervous system. Additionally, treatment with morphine significantly reduces the neuronal response caused by mechanical stimuli and is observable using the CMOS imaging platform, demonstrating a novel way to potentially assess and treat neuropathic pain.",

We employed genetic knockout of TRPM4 (Trpm4 <sup>-/-</sup> ) and glibenclamide treatment to explore the role of sulfonylurea receptor 1 transient receptor potential melastatin-4 (SUR1-TRPM4) channel in these Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses. Both approaches significantly suppressed the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in the astrocytic endfeet and reduced perivascular expression of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-related signaling pathway sensor calmodulin (CaM). Furthermore, we found that AQP4 localization was no longer confined to the domains of astrocytic endfeet following SE. Inhibition of SUR1-TRPM4 through pharmacological blockade or gene deletion restored the subcellular localization of AQP4, reduced cerebral edema, and improved cognitive outcomes post-SE. Our findings suggest that SUR1-TRPM4 plays a pivotal role in regulating astrocytic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals and mediating the aberrant expression and subcellular localization of astrocytic AQP4 along perivascular pathways. Together, these findings demonstrate a novel molecular mechanism underscoring SUR1-TRPM4 therapy in the treatment of SE characterized by dysregulated Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in astrocytic endfeet.",

        "abstract": "While genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicators are valuable for visualizing neural activity, their speed and sensitivity have had limited performance when compared to chemical dyes and electrophysiology, particularly at synaptic compartments. We addressed these limitations by engineering a suite of next-generation GCaMP8-based indicators, targeted to presynaptic boutons, active zones, and postsynaptic compartments at the Drosophila neuromuscular junction. We first validated these sensors to be superior to previous versions. Next, we developed a new Python-based analysis program, <i>CaFire,</i> which enables the automated quantification of evoked and spontaneous Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals. Using <i>CaFire,</i> we show a ratiometric presynaptic GCaMP8m sensor accurately captures physiologically-relevant presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> changes with superior sensitivity and similar kinetics compared to chemical dyes. Moreover, we test the ability of an active zone-targeted, ratiometric GCaMP8f sensor to report differences in Ca2+ between release sites. Finally, a newly engineered postsynaptic GCaMP8m, positioned near glutamate receptors, detects quantal events with temporal and signal resolution comparable to electrophysiological recordings. These next generation indicators and analytical methods demonstrate that GCaMP8 sensors, targeted to synaptic compartments, can now achieve the speed and sensitivity necessary to resolve Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics at levels previously only attainable with chemical dyes or electrophysiology.",

        "abstract": "The neurotransmitter histamine is involved in control of food intake, yet its dynamics during individual feeding episodes remain unexplored. Therefore, we used the novel genetically-encoded histamine sensor, HisLightG, combined with fiber photometry to measure histamine release in two hypothalamic regions critical for the food-suppressive effects of histamine, the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVH), and the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH). Male mice were tested under different conditions to assess whether hunger, time of day, or the caloric content of the solution they were given affected histamine fluctuations. We found that histamine levels changed rapidly in response to eating. These histamine fluctuations were influenced by experimental conditions, with slightly smaller responses when the test solution was sucralose (both regions) or during the light cycle (PVH only). Notable regional differences were identified, such that in the PVH histamine rebounded to above baseline levels, whereas in the VMH histamine remained lower than baseline for at least 10 s after licking ceased. In a separate cohort of male and female mice, enhancing histamine tone via administration of a histamine precursor (L-histidine) reduced the number of licks across multiple sucrose concentrations. Together, these findings indicate that histaminergic activity is modulated rapidly during ingestive episodes, and that understanding these release patterns will give insight into histamine's role in appetite suppression.",

        "abstract": "We developed the novel biosensor platform Luciferase Activity Modulated by Phosphorylation (LAMP) to monitor, with unprecedented sensitivity and dynamic range, reversible protein phosphorylation in cells. Based on NanoLuc luciferase complementation (NanoBiT), LAMP sensors are small (22 kD) and provide stable and bright light output that decreases upon phosphorylation and increases upon dephosphorylation. In this report, we designed LAMP biosensors to report spatial and temporal dynamics of cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) signaling. By incorporating both PKA phosphorylation and protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) dephosphorylation motifs into the small component of split NanoLuc (generating PKABiT/pBiT), we achieved a sevenfold dynamic range. LAMP sensors are modular and flexible, allowing the two components, LgBiT and pBiT, to be expressed as part of the same polypeptide (cis) or as part of separate, but interacting polypeptides (trans). With trans LAMP, we show that RIα and RIβ form heterodimers with activities indistinguishable from homodimers of the two PKA regulatory subunit isoforms. Cis PKA LAMP sensors revealed different activation and inactivation kinetics of endogenous, membrane anchored PKA/RI and PKA/RII holoenzymes. They also allowed us to measure kinetics of cAMP diffusion and PKA catalytic subunit translocation to the nucleus. Finally, we used a regeneratively phosphorylated PKA LAMP sensor to identify an autoinhibitory sequence in the PP2A regulatory subunit B56δ. By tailoring the sequence of pBiT, the LAMP platform can be extended to track the activity of other protein kinases and phosphatases and second messengers they respond to, thus providing new tools for cell signaling research and drug discovery.",

Continuous-wave ESR measurements at room temperature show a rigid Aer flavin immobilized in the cofactor pocket and Q-band electron nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) measurements identify a predominant anionic semiquinone radical state in cell. Q-band four-pulse double electron-electron resonance (4P-DEER) measurements indicate a 4.1 nm distance between the two flavins of an Aer homodimer, consistent with previous in vitro measurements, but also reveal additional separations in cell indicative of chemoreceptor arrays, not previously observed for Aer.

        "abstract": "Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD), caused by prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE), is characterized by significant cognitive impairments, including reduced cognitive flexibility. Despite the critical role of cholinergic interneurons (CINs) in the dorsomedial striatum (DMS) for cognitive and behavioral flexibility, their contribution to neurobehavioral deficits in FASD remains unclear. To address this gap, this research explored the impact of PAE on CIN populations and activity, cognitive flexibility, and compulsive drinking behaviors in adult offspring. Using ChAT-Cre;Ai14-tdTomato mice combined with ChAT staining, we found substantial reductions in CIN number within the striatum of adult PAE offspring. Functional assessments revealed that PAE markedly decreased CIN firing activity and reduced acetylcholine (ACh) release in the DMS, as measured by electrophysiology recordings and live-tissue confocal imaging using a genetically encoded ACh sensor. Behaviorally, PAE-exposed offspring exhibited a significant deficit in adapting to reversed action-outcome contingencies despite intact initial learning capabilities. Moreover, PAE-exposed mice exhibited compulsive alcohol drinking behavior, characterized by elevated consumption and preference for quinine-adulterated alcohol. These findings collectively highlight the critical role of impaired cholinergic signaling in the cognitive and behavioral deficits observed following PAE. Understanding this cholinergic dysfunction provides valuable insights necessary for developing targeted interventions aimed at mitigating cognitive and behavioral consequences associated with FASD.",

To date, no versatile technology has been developed to directly label and visualize an active replicase in live plant cells because, in general, replicase function is not retained when it is fused to a protein for fluorescence imaging. We developed a technique to label and image a plant virus replicase during infection using the transiently expressed human influenza hemagglutinin (HA) frankenbody (FB), an antibody fragment that binds the HA epitope. The function of FB was demonstrated by visualizing the targeting of mCherry-fused FB (FB-mCherry) to an HA-tagged and GFP-fused endoplasmic reticulum (ER) marker protein in its native location. The combination of a two-component inducible system with the FB probe enabled FB-mCherry to label an HA epitope-tagged, functional replicase of Plantago asiatica mosaic virus (PlAMV) during its infection in Nicotiana benthamiana cells without affecting virus replication efficiency. The HA-tagged PlAMV replicase forms punctate structures associated with the ER and plasmodesmata and is localized in the vicinity of dsRNA, a hallmark of a viral replication complex. This application of epitope tag-binding intracellular probes for live subcellular imaging in plant cells offers insights into the localization dynamics of an active plant virus replicase during infection and the potential to co-localize host factors with the active replicase in situ.",

        "abstract": "Protein poly-ADP-ribosylation (PARylation) is a post-translational modification formed by transferring successive units of ADP-ribose to target proteins to form poly-ADP-ribose (PAR) chains. PAR plays a critical role in the DNA damage response (DDR) by acting as a signaling platform to promote the recruitment of DNA repair factors to the sites of DNA damage that bind via their PAR-binding domains (PBDs). Several classes of PBD families have been identified, which recognize distinct parts of the PAR chain. Proteins encoding PBDs play an essential role in conveying the PAR-mediated signal through their interaction with PAR chains, which mediates many cellular functions, including the DDR. The WWE domain, encoded in 12 human proteins, identifies the iso-ADP-ribose moiety of the PAR chain. PARylation is a heterogeneous structure that is highly dynamic in cells. Capturing the dynamics of PARylation is essential to understanding its role in the DDR, which can be achieved by expanding the tool kit for PAR detection and tracking mediated by the unique binding capability of various sensors. We recently described the WWE domain of RNF146 as a robust genetically encoded probe, when fused to EGFP, for the detection of PAR in live cells. Expanding on this, we used structural prediction tools to evaluate all of the WWE domains encoded in human proteins, evaluating each as molecular PAR probes in live cells. We demonstrate unique PAR dynamics when tracked by WWE-encoded PAR binding domains, in addition to an engineered macrodomain, that can be exploited for modulation of the PAR-dependent DNA damage response.",

Genetically tagging fluorescent RNA reporters to an RNA of interest allows for investigating RNA spatiotemporal dynamics. We previously developed a fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM)-based RNA-tagging platform, Riboglow-FLIM. Here, a genetically encoded RNA tag binds a fluorescent probe, causing an increase in both fluorescence intensity and fluorescence lifetime. Importantly, the Riboglow platform is derived from a bacterial riboswitch RNA family and different riboswitch sequences from nature may build the basis for multiplexing capabilities. We previously observed fluorescence lifetime differences for two RNA tags <i>in vitro</i> and in live mammalian cells as a proof-of-concept demonstration. As an in-depth expansion for multiplexing capabilities, here we evaluate the performance of different RNA sequences <i>in vitro</i> for systematically expanding the RNA tag sequence space of Riboglow-FLIM. We use two methods of varying the genetic tag to evaluate multiplexing capabilities, a literature-guided and a rational design approach. The literature-guided approach includes riboswitch sequences with both indirect and direct evidence of probe binding. For this, a phylogenetic tree of riboswitch-derived tags from indirect binding results was constructed, and RNA members from different branches were characterized. We also designed RNA mutations rationally based on insights from established Riboglow RNA tags. Together, nine different RNA tags yielded a wide range of fluorescence lifetimes for the Riboglow-FLIM platform, building the foundation to tag and track several different RNAs simultaneously.

        "abstract": "Dipeptidyl peptidases 8 and 9 (DPP8/9) are critical for the quality control of mitochondrial and endoplasmic reticulum protein import, immune regulation, cell adhesion, and cell migration. Dysregulation of DPP8/9 is associated with pathologies including tumorigenesis and inflammation. Commonly, DPP8/9 activity is analysed by in vitro assays using artificial substrates, which allow neither continuously monitoring DPP8/9 activity in individual, living cells nor detecting effects from endogenous interactors and posttranslational modifications. Here, we developed DiPAK (for DPP8/9 activity sensor based on AK2), a ratiometric genetically encoded fluorescent sensor, which enables studying DPP8/9 activity in living cells. Using DiPAK, we determined the dynamic range of DPP8/9 activity in cells overexpressing or lacking DPP9. We identified distinct activity levels among melanoma cell lines and found that LPS-induced primary B-cell activation depends on DPP8/9 as the absence of DPP8/9 activity results in apoptotic but not pyroptotic cell death. Consistently, we observed increasing DPP8/9 activity during B-cell maturation. Overall, DiPAK is a versatile tool for real-time single-cell monitoring of DPP8/9 activity in a broad range of cells and organisms.",

        "abstract": "Adenosine (Ado), a nucleoside bridging intracellular metabolism with intercellular communication, plays an essential role in regulating processes such as sleep and seizure. While the functions of extracellular Ado (\"eAdo\") are well documented, our knowledge about the distribution and regulatory functions of intracellular Ado (\"iAdo\") is limited by a lack of methods for detecting iAdo in vivo. Here, we develop HypnoS, a genetically encoded fluorescent sensor for iAdo characterized by its high sensitivity, specificity, spatiotemporal resolution, and rapid response (sub-seconds). HypnoS enables real-time visualization of iAdo dynamics in live cultures, acute brain slices, flies, and freely moving mice. Using HypnoS for dual-color mesoscopic imaging in mice, we show that seizure-induced iAdo waves propagated across the cortex, following calcium signals. Additionally, two-photon imaging reveals that iAdo decays more rapidly in astrocytes than in neurons during seizures. Moreover, by recording iAdo dynamics in the basal forebrain during the sleep-wake cycle, we observe that iAdo signals are present during wakefulness and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, regulated by equilibrative nucleoside transporters (ENT1/2). Thus, HypnoS is a versatile and powerful tool for investigating the biological functions of iAdo across a range of physiological and pathological states.",

However, lifetime-readout sensors are poorly understood at a molecular level, complicating their development. Although there are many sensors that have fluorescence-intensity changes, there are currently only a few with fluorescence-lifetime changes. Here, we optimized two biosensors for thiol-disulfide redox (RoTq-Off and RoTq-On) with opposite changes in fluorescence lifetime in response to oxidation. Using biophysical approaches, we showed that the high-lifetime states of these sensors lock the chromophore more firmly in place than their low-lifetime states do. Two-photon fluorescence lifetime imaging of RoTq-On fused to a glutaredoxin (Grx1) enabled robust, straightforward monitoring of cytosolic glutathione redox state in acute mouse brain slices. The motional mechanism described here is probably common and may inform the design of other lifetime-readout sensors; the Grx1-RoTq-On fusion sensor will be useful for studying glutathione redox in physiology.",

However, progress in developing red-shifted GECIs, despite their advantages over green indicators, has been slower, resulting in fewer options for end users. In this study, we explored topological inversion and soma-targeting strategies, which are complementary to conventional mutagenesis, to re-engineer a red genetically encoded calcium indicator, FRCaMP, for enhanced in vivo performance. The resulting sensors, FRCaMPi and soma-targeted FRCaMPi (SomaFRCaMPi), exhibit up to 2-fold higher dynamic range and peak ΔF/F0 per single AP compared to widely used jRGECO1a in neurons both in culture and in vivo. Compared to jRGECO1a and FRCaMPi, SomaFRCaMPi reduces erroneous correlation of neuronal activity in the brains of mice and zebrafish by two- to 4-fold due to diminished neuropil contamination without compromising the signal-to-noise ratio. Under wide-field imaging in primary somatosensory and visual cortices in mice with high labeling density (80-90%), SomaFRCaMPi exhibits up to 40% higher SNR and decreased artifactual correlation across neurons. Altogether, SomaFRCaMPi improves the accuracy and scale of neuronal activity imaging at single-neuron resolution in densely labeled brain tissues due to a 2-3-fold enhanced automated neuronal segmentation, 50% higher fraction of responsive cells, up to 2-fold higher SNR compared to jRGECO1a. Our findings highlight the potential of SomaFRCaMPi, comparable to the most sensitive soma-targeted GCaMP, for precise spatial recording of neuronal populations using popular imaging modalities in model organisms such as zebrafish and mice.",

In this study, we investigated the impact of Q10 on the spatio-temporal patterns of cellular energetics in keratinocyte-derived HaCaT cells, utilizing the genetically-encoded FRET sensor AMPfret. Engineered from the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), this sensor leverages endogenous affinities of the kinase that evolved to detect energy stress, specifically decreases in ATP/ADP and ATP/AMP ratios that pose a threat to cell survival. We successfully established HaCaT cells stably expressing AMPfret, validated their functionality by inducing energy stress with 2-deoxy-D-glucose, and demonstrated that Q10, together with high glucose conditions in culture, can enhance cellular energetics compared to low glucose controls. We then employed AMPfret to analyze the spatio-temporal response of HaCaT keratinocytes to Luperox (tert-butyl peroxide), a potent organic prooxidant, in the presence of varying intracellular levels of Q10. Preloading cells with Q10 was protective, slowing the speed and reducing the extend of the energy stress response. In contrast, preincubation with Simvastatin, an inhibitor of the mevalonate Q10 biosynthesis pathway, depleted cellular Q10 levels, accelerated the onset of energy stress, and led to early cell death as compared to controls. Under all conditions, AMPfret revealed cell-to-cell heterogeneity in energy stress at baseline and in the response to Luperox. Overall, tracking changes in energy state in time and at single-cell level allows further insights into the beneficial role of Q10 in enhancing cellular bioenergetics in skin cells, and a potential role of AMPK in mediating responses to altered Q10 levels.",

        "abstract": "Genetically encoded phosphorescent proteins with extended luminescence lifetimes provide an orthogonal channel for biological imaging and detection. While conventional fluorescent proteins typically exhibit nanosecond-scale lifetimes, the development of proteins with longer lifetimes enables time-resolved detection and enhanced signal-to-noise ratios. Here, we designed a novel phosphorescent protein system by incorporating photosensitizing unnatural amino acids (UAAs) proximal to the metal center of a lanthanide binding protein (LanM). Through systematic optimization of the incorporation sites, we achieved considerable enhancement in lanthanide phosphorescence compared with that of the wild-type LanM protein. The subsequent directed evolution of LanM and chemical evolution of UAA yielded variants with an additional muti-fold increase in signal intensity. This iterative optimization strategy generated phosphorescent proteins with extended lifetimes of up to 500 μs and significantly increased brightness. Using this phosphorescence protein platform, a europium sensor with a signal-to-noise ratio of more than 100 for 200 nM Eu(III) and a detection limit of less than 10 nM was developed. In addition, a protease sensor was further designed by inserting a cleavage site into a loop of the phosphorescent protein, achieving remarkable signal-to-noise ratios at nanomolar concentrations. Finally, this phosphorescent protein was fused to the affibody and further used for immunofluorescence imaging. These applications demonstrated a novel platform for developing genetically encoded sensors with enhanced detection sensitivity through time-resolved measurements.",

The eSylite design minimizes a spatial dye offset and thereby enables visualization of PSD-95 with improved localization precision and further time-resolved discrimination.

Male mice were tested under different conditions to assess whether hunger, time of day, or the caloric content of the solution they were given affected histamine fluctuations. We found that histamine levels changed rapidly in response to eating. These histamine fluctuations were influenced by experimental conditions, with slightly smaller responses when the test solution was sucralose (both regions) or during the light cycle (PVH only). Notable regional differences were identified, such that in the PVH histamine rebounded to baseline levels, whereas in the VMH histamine remained lower than baseline for at least 10 seconds after licking ceased. In a separate cohort of male and female mice, enhancing histamine tone via administration of a histamine precursor (L-histidine) reduced the number of licks across multiple sucrose concentrations. Together, these findings indicate that histaminergic activity is modulated rapidly during ingestive episodes, and that understanding these release patterns will give insight into histamine's role in appetite suppression.",

In addition to D2HGlo's potential clinical utility, we also present findings for its adaptation to the cellular environment. To assess D-2-HG production in living immortalized glioma cells, we engineered D2HGlo sensors that localize to subcellular compartments, which yielded findings of elevated D-2-HG in the cytosol, mitochondria, and nucleus of IDH1 mutant cells. D2HGlo was used to perform a side-by-side comparison of cytosolic and secreted D-2-HG to reveal that glycolysis, but not glutamine catabolism, drives D-2-HG production in IDH1 mutant cells.",

        "abstract": "Mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP, ΔΨm) is critical for mitochondrial functions, including ATP synthesis, ion transport, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and the import of proteins encoded by the nucleus. Existing methods for measuring ΔΨm typically use lipophilic cation dyes, such as Rhodamine 800 and tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester (TMRM), but these are limited by low specificity and are not well-suited for in vivo applications. To address these limitations, we have developed a novel protocol utilizing genetically encoded voltage indicators (GEVIs). Genetically encoded voltage indicators (GEVIs), which generate fluorescent signals in response to membrane potential changes, have demonstrated significant potential for monitoring plasma membrane and neuronal potentials. However, their application to mitochondrial membranes remains unexplored. Here, we developed protein-based mitochondrial-targeted GEVIs capable of detecting ΔΨm fluctuations in cells and the motor cortex of living animals. The mitochondrial potential indicator (MPI)offers a non-invasive approach to study ΔΨm dynamics in real-time, providing a method to investigate mitochondrial function under both normal and pathological conditions.",

Among GEVIs, near-infrared-shifted GEVIs offer faster kinetics, better tissue penetration, and compatibility with optogenetic tools, enabling all-optical electrophysiology in complex biological contexts. In our previous work, we employed the directed molecular evolution of microbial rhodopsin Archaerhodopsin-3 (Arch-3) in mammalian cells to develop a voltage sensor called Archon1. Archon1 demonstrated excellent membrane localization, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), sensitivity, kinetics, and photostability, and full compatibility with optogenetic tools. However, Archon1 suffers from low brightness and requires high illumination intensities, which leads to tissue heating and phototoxicity during prolonged imaging. In this study, we aim to improve the brightness of this voltage sensor. We performed random mutation on a bright Archon derivative and identified a novel variant, monArch, which exhibits satisfactory voltage sensitivity (4~5% ΔF/F<sub>AP</sub>) and a 9-fold increase in basal brightness compared with Archon1. However, it is hindered by suboptimal membrane localization and compromised voltage sensitivity. These challenges underscore the need for continued optimization to achieve an optimal balance of brightness, stability, and functionality in rhodopsin-based voltage sensors.",

        "abstract": "Neuronal communication is mediated by synaptic transmission, which depends primarily on the release of neurotransmitters stored in synaptic vesicles (SVs) in response to an action potential (AP). Since SVs are recycled locally at the presynaptic terminal, coordination of SV exocytosis and endocytosis is important for sustained synaptic transmission. A pH-sensitive green fluorescent protein, called pHluorin, provides a powerful tool to monitor SV exo/endocytosis by targeting it to the SV lumen. However, tracking AP-driven SV recycling with the pHluorin-based probes is still largely limited to in vitro culture preparations because the introduction of genetically encoded probes and subsequent optical imaging is technically challenging in general for in vivo animal models or tissue preparations. Zebrafish is a model system offering valuable features, including ease of genetic manipulation, optical clarity, and rapid external development. We recently generated a transgenic zebrafish that highly expresses a pHluorin-labeled probe at motor neuron terminals and developed a protocol to monitor AP-driven SV exo/endocytosis at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ), a well-established synapse model that forms in vivo. In this article, we show how to prepare larval zebrafish NMJ preparation suitable for pHluorin imaging. We also show that the preparation allows time-lapse imaging under conventional upright epifluorescence microscope, providing a cost-effective platform for analyzing NMJ function.",

We demonstrate imaging of PTEN activity in cell lines, intact Caenorhabditis elegans and in the mouse brain.

We then used widefield fluorescent imaging to measure V1 dynamics in response to visual stimuli with diverse temporal waveforms and contrasts, and compared these responses to signals measured using a genetically encoded calcium indicator (GECI) and a synthetic voltage-sensitive dye (VSD). When compared to GECI, GEVI captures faster response dynamics, tracks higher temporal frequencies, and responds to lower contrasts. To quantitatively characterize these three signals, we developed a simple nonlinear model that predicts the response dynamics to stimuli with arbitrary temporal waveforms and contrasts.

In this study, we explored topological inversion and soma-targeting strategies, which are complementary to conventional mutagenesis, to re-engineer a red genetically encoded calcium indicator, FRCaMP, for enhanced <i>in vivo</i> performance. The resulting sensors, FRCaMPi and soma-targeted FRCaMPi (SomaFRCaMPi), exhibit up to 2-fold higher dynamic range and peak ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> per single AP compared to widely used jRGECO1a in neurons in culture and <i>in vivo</i>.

This assay enables screening of membrane micropeptides and small molecules that modulate SERCA and Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase activity and may facilitate development of therapies that target cellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling. Of the micropeptides tested, phospholamban (PLB) had the greatest degree of inhibition of SERCA, as measured by a decrease in ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> content compared to control. Sarcolipin (SLN), endoregulin (ELN), and another-regulin (ALN) also decreased ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> content, though less potently than PLB. We also investigated micropeptides that have been shown to have a positive effect on ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake. Dwarf open reading frame (DWORF), a positive modulator of SERCA activity, and phospholemman (PLM), an inhibitor of the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase, both increased ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> content compared to control. A superinhibitory variant of PLM, R70C, further increased ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> load compared to wild type PLM. Overall, our findings indicate that the inhibitory potency of micropeptides is governed by their relative binding affinities to SERCA. This allows for finely tuned modulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling in different tissues based on differential expressions of micropeptide species. Understanding the contribution of each micropeptide to SERCA regulation may reveal novel strategies for therapeutic intervention in conditions where calcium dysregulation plays a role, such as heart disease, vascular disease, or neurodegenerative disorders.",

        "abstract": "Oxidative stress is a prominent feature of Alzheimer's disease. Within this context, cholesterol undergoes oxidation, producing the pro-inflammatory product 7-ketocholesterol (7-KC). In this study, we observe elevated levels of 7-KC in the brains of the 3xTg mouse model of AD. To further understand the contribution of 7-KC on the oxidative environment, we developed a method to express a genetically encoded fluorescent hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) sensor in astrocytes, the primary source of cholesterol in the brain. With this sensor, we discovered that 7-KC increases H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> levels in astrocytes in vivo, but not when directly applied to astrocytes in vitro. Interestingly, when 7-KC was applied to a microglia cell line alone or mixed astrocyte and microglia cultures, it resulted in microglia activation and increased oxidative stress in astrocytes. Depletion of microglia from 3xTg mice resulted in reduced 7-KC in the brains of these mice. Taken together, these findings suggest that 7-KC, acting through microglia, contributes to increased astrocyte oxidative stress in AD. This study sheds light on the complex interplay between cholesterol oxidation, microglia activation, and astrocyte oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of AD.",

        "abstract": "The persistence of cocaine-evoked adaptations relies on gene regulations within the reward circuit, especially in the ventral striatum (i.e., nucleus accumbens [NAc]). Notably, activation of the ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) pathway in the striatum is known to trigger a transcriptional program shaping long-term responses to cocaine. Nuclear calcium signaling has also been shown to control multiple forms of transcription-dependent neuroadaptations, but the dynamics and roles of striatal nuclear calcium signaling in preclinical models of addiction remain unknown. A genetically encoded cell type-specific nuclear calcium probe has been developed to monitor calcium dynamics in the nuclei of striatal neurons, including in freely moving mice. A cell type-specific inhibitor of nuclear calcium signaling combined with 3-dimensional imaging of neuronal morphology, immunostaining, and behavior was used to disentangle the roles of nuclear calcium in NAc medium spiny neurons (MSNs) expressing the dopamine D<sub>1</sub> receptor (D1R) or D<sub>2</sub> receptor (D2R) on cocaine-evoked responses. The D1R-mediated potentiation of calcium influx through glutamate NMDA receptors, which shapes cocaine effects, also drives nuclear calcium transients. Fiber photometry revealed that cocaine-treated mice showed a sustained nuclear calcium increase in NAc D1R-MSNs. Disrupting nuclear calcium in D1R-MSNs, but not D2R-MSNs, blocked cocaine-evoked morphological changes of MSNs and gene expression and blunted cocaine's rewarding effects. Our study unravels the dynamics and roles of cocaine-induced nuclear calcium signaling increases in D1R-MSNs on molecular, cellular, and behavioral adaptations to cocaine and represents a significant breakthrough because it could contribute to the development of innovative strategies with therapeutic potential to alleviate addiction symptoms.",

We found that Arg levels in MDA-MB-231 cells decreased after depletion of extracellular Arg with a concomitant decline in cell viability.

However, the inherent features of protein clustering, especially for its reversible behavior and subtle microenvironment variation, present significant hurdles in probe chemistry for tracking protein clustering dynamics. Herein, we report a bilateral-tailored chemigenetic probe, in which an \"amphiphilic\" aggregate-induced emission luminogen (AIEgen) QMSO<sub>3</sub>Cl is covalently conjugated to a protein tag that is genetically fused to protein-of-interest (POI). Prior to target POI, the \"amphiphilic\" AIE-active QMSO<sub>3</sub>Cl achieves a completely dark state in both aqueous biological environment and lipophilic organelles, thereby ensuring an ultra-low intrinsic background interference. Upon reaching POI, the combination of synthetic molecule and genetically encoded protein allows for protein clustering-dependent ultra-sensitive response, with a substantial lighting-up fluorescence (67.5-fold) as protein transitions from disassembling to clustering state. Such ultra-high signal-to-noise ratio enables to monitor the dynamic and fate of inositol requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1) clustering/disassembling under both acute and chronic endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in living cells.

        "abstract": "Two or more protein ligands may compete against each other to interact transiently with a protein receptor. While this is a ubiquitous phenomenon in cell signaling, existing technologies cannot identify its kinetic complexity because specific subpopulations of binding events of different ligands are hidden in the averaging process in an ensemble. In addition, the limited time resolution of prevailing methods makes detecting and discriminating binding events among diverse interacting partners challenging. Here, we utilize a genetically encoded nanopore sensor to disentangle competitive protein-protein interactions (PPIs) in a one-on-one and label-free fashion. Our measurements involve binary mixtures of protein ligands of varying binding affinity against the same receptor, which was externally immobilized on the nanopore tip. We use the resistive-pulse technique to monitor the kinetics and dynamics of reversible PPIs without the nanopore confinement, with a high-time bandwidth, and at titratable ligand concentrations. In this way, we systematically evaluate how individual protein ligands take their turn to reside on the receptor's binding site. Further, our single-molecule determinations of these interactions are quantitatively compared with data generated by a two-ligand, one-receptor queuing model. The outcomes of this work provide a fundamental basis for future developments aimed at a better mechanistic understanding of competitive PPIs. Moreover, they may also form a platform in drug development pipelines targeting high-complexity PPIs mediated by protein hubs.",

We developed a novel experimental platform in which tissue is stimulated optogenetically while Vm and CaT are imaged simultaneously. The Vm indicator is an organic dye, while the CaT indicator is genetically encoded. We used cardiac spheroids containing cardiomyocytes and fibroblasts differentiated from human induced pluripotent stem cells as model tissue. The spheroids were genetically encoded with an optogenetic actuator, CheRiff, and the calcium indicator jRCaMP1b. The Vm indicator was the organic dye RH237. CheRiff was excited using blue light (450 nm), and both RH237 and jRCaMP1b were excited using a single band of green light (either 525-575 nm or 558-575 nm). Fluorescence emission was split and imaged by two cameras (CaT: 595-665 nm; Vm: >700 nm). The spheroids were successfully stimulated optogenetically and Vm and CaT were recorded simultaneously without cross-talk using both excitation light bands. The 525-575 nm band produced higher signal-to-noise ratios than the 558-575 nm band, but caused a slight increase in tissue excitability because of CheRiff activation. The optogenetic actuator and CaT indicator are genetically encoded and can be expressed in engineered tissue constructs. In contrast, the Vm indicator is an organic dye that can stain any tissue. This system is well-suited for studying coupling between engineered tissue grafts and host tissue because the two tissue types can be stimulated independently, and tissue activation can be unambiguously attributed to either graft or host.",

Subsequently, we applied GlutaR to investigate how chemical and genetic inhibition of glutamine synthetase (GS) and glutaminase (GLS) differentially alter glutamine levels in subcellular compartments.

These methods typically rely on genetically encoded sensors and actuators to monitor and control neural activity. For microendoscopic calcium imaging, injection of a virus followed by implantation of a lens probe is required to express a calcium sensor and enable optical access to the target brain region. This two-step process poses several challenges, chief among them being the risks associated with mistargeting and/or misalignment between virus expression zone, lens probe and target brain region. Here, an adeno-associated virus (AAV)-eluting polymer coating is engineered for gradient refractive index (GRIN) lenses enabling the expression of a genetically encoded calcium indicator (GCaMP) directly within the brain region of interest upon implantation of the lens. This approach requires only one surgical step and guarantees alignment between GCaMP expression and lens in the brain. Additionally, the slow virus release from these coatings increases the working time for surgical implantation, expanding the brain regions and species amenable to this approach. These enhanced capabilities should accelerate neuroscience research utilizing optical methods and advance the understanding of the neural circuit mechanisms underlying brain function and behavior in health and disease.",

        "abstract": "Measuring ongoing cellular activity is essential to understanding the dynamic functions of biological organisms. The most popular current approach is imaging fluorescence-based genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicators (GECIs). While fluorescent probes are useful in many contexts, bioluminescence-based GECIs-probes that generate light through oxidation of a small-molecule by a luciferase or photoprotein-have several distinct advantages. Because bioluminescent (BL) GECIs do not use the bright extrinsic excitation light required for fluorescence, BL GECIs do not photobleach, do not suffer from nonspecific autofluorescent background, and do not cause phototoxicity. Further, BL GECIs can be applied in contexts where directly shining photons on an imaging target is not possible. Despite these advantages, the use of BL GECIs has to date been limited by their small changes in bioluminescence intensity, high baseline signal at resting Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations, and suboptimal Ca<sup>2+</sup> affinities. Here, we describe a new BL GECI, CaBLAM (Ca<sup>2+</sup> BioLuminescence Activity Monitor), that displays much higher dynamic range than previous BL GECIs and has a Ca<sup>2+</sup> affinity suitable for capturing physiological changes in cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration.

        "abstract": "The calcium cation is a crucial signaling molecule involved in numerous cellular pathways. Beyond its role as a messenger or modulator in intracellular cascades, calcium's function in excitable cells, including nerve impulse transmission, is remarkable. The central role of calcium in nervous activity has driven the rapid development of fluorescent techniques for monitoring this cation in living cells. Specifically, genetically encoded calcium indicators (GECIs) are the most in-demand molecular tools in their class. In this work, we address two issues of calcium imaging by designing indicators based on the successful GCaMP6 backbone and the fluorescent protein BrUSLEE. The first indicator variant (GCaMP6s-BrUS), with a reduced, calcium-insensitive fluorescence lifetime, has potential in monitoring calcium dynamics with a high temporal resolution in combination with advanced microscopy techniques, such as light beads microscopy, where the fluorescence lifetime limits acquisition speed. Conversely, the second variant (GCaMP6s-BrUS-145), with a flexible, calcium-sensitive fluorescence lifetime, is relevant for static measurements, particularly for determining absolute calcium concentration values using fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM). To identify the structural determinants of calcium sensitivity in these indicator variants, we determine their spatial structures. A comparative structural analysis allowed the optimization of the GCaMP6s-BrUS construct, resulting in an indicator variant combining calcium-sensitive behavior in the time domain and enhanced molecular brightness. Our data may serve as a starting point for further engineering efforts towards improved GECI variants with fine-tuned fluorescence lifetimes.",

Disruption of subcellular calcium homeostasis and downstream stress pathways in the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria, including the unfolded protein response (UPR), have been implicated in the pathophysiology of noise-induced hearing loss. However, studies on the association between calcium homeostasis and stress pathways have been limited due to limited ability to measure calcium dynamics in mature-hearing, noise-exposed mice. We used a genetically encoded calcium indicator mouse model in which GCaMP6f is expressed specifically in hair cells or supporting cells under control of Myo15Cre or Sox2Cre, respectively. We performed live calcium imaging and UPR gene expression analysis in 8-week-old mice exposed to levels of noise that cause cochlear synaptopathy (98 db sound pressure level [SPL]) or permanent hearing loss (106 dB SPL). UPR activation occurred immediately after noise exposure, and the pattern of UPR activation was dependent on noise level, with the proapoptotic pathway upregulated only after 106 dB noise exposure. Spontaneous calcium transients in hair cells and intercellular calcium waves in supporting cells, which are present in neonatal cochleae, were quiescent in mature-hearing cochleae but reactivated upon noise exposure. Noise exposure of 106 dB was associated with more persistent and expansive intercellular Ca2+ signaling wave activity. These findings demonstrate a strong and dose-dependent association between noise exposure, UPR activation, and changes in calcium homeostasis in hair cells and supporting cells, suggesting that targeting these pathways may be effective to develop treatments for noise-induced hearing loss.",

        "abstract": "Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) adopt ensembles of rapidly fluctuating heterogeneous conformations, influencing their binding capabilities and supramolecular transitions. The primary conformational descriptors for understanding IDP ensembles-the radius of gyration (<i>R</i><sub>G</sub>), measured by small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), and the root mean square (rms) end-to-end distance (<i>R</i><sub>E</sub>), probed by fluorescent resonance energy transfer (FRET)-are often reported to produce inconsistent results regarding IDP expansion as a function of denaturant concentration in the buffer. This ongoing debate surrounding the FRET-SAXS discrepancy raises questions about the overall reliability of either method for quantitatively studying IDP properties. To address this discrepancy, we introduce a genetically encoded anomalous SAXS (ASAXS) ruler, enabling simultaneous and direct measurements of <i>R</i><sub>G</sub> and <i>R</i><sub>E</sub> without assuming a specific structural model. This ruler utilizes a genetically encoded noncanonical amino acid with two bromine atoms, providing an anomalous X-ray scattering signal for precise distance measurements. Through this approach, we experimentally demonstrate that the ratio between <i>R</i><sub>E</sub> and <i>R</i><sub>G</sub> varies under different denaturing conditions, highlighting the intrinsic properties of IDPs as the primary source of the observed SAXS-FRET discrepancy rather than shortcomings in either of the two established methods.

Although there have been reports of both synthetic and genetically encoded fluorescent K<sup>+</sup> indicators, there remains a need for an indicator that is genetically targetable, has high specificity for K<sup>+</sup> versus Na<sup>+</sup>, and has a high fluorescent response in the red to far-red wavelength range. Here, we introduce a series of chemigenetic K<sup>+</sup> indicators, designated as the HaloKbp1 series, based on the bacterial K<sup>+</sup>-binding protein (Kbp) inserted into HaloTag7 self-labeled with environmentally sensitive rhodamine derivatives. This series of high-performance indicators features high brightness in the red to far-red region, large intensiometric fluorescence changes, and a range of <i>K</i><sub>d</sub> values.

        "abstract": "The mammalian or mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) is activated on the surface of lysosomes and phosphorylates substrates at various subcellular locations, including the lysosome, cytosol, and nucleus. However, the signaling and biological functions of nuclear mTORC1 (nmTORC1) are not well understood, primarily due to limited tools for monitoring mTORC1 activity in the nucleus. In this study, we developed a genetically encoded nmTORC1 sensor, termed nTORSEL, based on the phosphorylation of the eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) binding protein 1 (4EBP1) by mTORC1 within the nucleus. nTORSEL, like its predecessor TORSEL, exhibits a fluorescent punctate pattern in the nucleus through multivalent protein-protein interactions between oligomerized 4EBP1 and eIF4E when nmTORC1 activity is low. We validated nTORSEL using biochemical analyses and imaging techniques across representative cell lines with varying levels of nmTORC1 activity. Notably, nTORSEL specifically detects physiological, pharmacological, and genetic inhibition of nmTORC1 in mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells but not in HEK293T cells. Therefore, nTORSEL is an effective tool for investigating nuclear mTORC1 signaling in cell lines.",

        "abstract": "Plasmodium male and female gametocytes are the gatekeepers of human-to-mosquito transmission, therefore essential for propagation of malaria within a population. Whilst dormant in humans, their divergent roles during transmission become apparent soon after mosquito feeding with a rapid transformation into gametes - males forming eight motile sperm-like cells aiming to fertilise a single female gamete. Little is known about how the parasite fuels this abrupt change, and the potential role played by their large and elaborate cristate mitochondrion. Using a sex-specific antibody and functional mitochondrial labelling, we show that the male gametocyte mitochondrion is less active than that of female gametocytes and more sensitive to antimalarials targeting mitochondrial energy metabolism. Rather than a vestigial organelle discarded during male gametogenesis, we demonstrate that mitochondrial ATP synthesis is essential for its completion. Additionally, using a genetically encoded ratiometric ATP sensor, we show that gametocytes can maintain cytoplasmic ATP homeostasis in the absence of mitochondrial respiration, indicating the essentiality of the gametocyte mitochondrion for transmission alone. Together, this reveals how gametocytes responsively balance the conflicting demands of a dormant and active lifestyle, highlighting the mitochondria as a rich source of transmission-blocking targets for future drug development.",

Mitochondrion acts as a Ca<sup>2+</sup> sink and a central player for maintaining Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis. Accurately monitoring Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients within the mitochondrial matrix that undergo constant pH fluctuations is challenging, as signals of most currently available GECIs suffer from artifacts induced by physiological pH variations.

Results from molecular dynamics simulations and <i>ab initio</i> calculations revealed that the deprotonation of the chromophore may be responsible for the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent changes in TurCaMP signals. TurCaMP sensors showed inverse response to Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients, and their responses were not affected by pH changes within the range of pH 6-9.

Maturation of active insulin occurs within insulin secretory granules (ISG) by acidification of the lumen and enzymatic cleavage of insulin before secretion. This process is dysregulated in diabetes, and many questions remain on how the cell controls insulin maturation. We address this gap in knowledge by designing two genetically encoded fluorescence pH sensors and a fluorescence lifetime imaging and analysis pipeline to monitor the pH of individual secretory ISGs within live cells at higher resolution and precision than previously possible. We observed different subpopulations of ISGs based on their pH and subcellular localization. Signals regulating metabolism vs membrane depolarization mobilize different subpopulations of ISGs for secretion, and we confirm that maturation signals acidify ISGs. We conclude that different signaling networks uniquely impact ISG mobilization and secretion. Future applications of these tools will be useful for exploring how these processes are dysregulated in diabetes and provide new paths for developing more effective treatments.",

However, biosensors for imaging sulfate ions, the fourth most abundant physiological anion, in mammalian cells are still lacking. Here, we report the development and characterization of a green fluorescent biosensor for sulfate named Thyone. Thyone, derived through structure-guided design from bright green fluorescent protein mNeonGreen, exhibited a large negative fluorescence response upon subsecond association with sulfate anion with an affinity of 11 mM in mammalian cells. By integrating mutagenesis analyses with molecular dynamics simulations, we elucidated the molecular mechanism of sulfate binding and revealed key amino acid residues responsible for sulfate sensitivity. High anion selectivity and sensitivity of Thyone allowed for imaging of sulfate anion transients mediated by sulfate transporter heterologously expressed in cultured mammalian cells.

        "abstract": "Extensive phosphorylation at serine 22 (pSer22) on lamin A is the hallmark of cell mitosis, which contributes to the breakdown of nuclear envelope. In the interphase, pSer22 lamin A exists in low abundance and is involved in mechanotransduction, virus infection, and gene expression. Numerous evidences emerge to support lamin A regulation on cell function and fate by phosphorylation. However, live-cell imaging tools for visualizing the dynamics of pSer22 lamin A are yet to be established. Herein, we developed a novel lamin A phosphorylation sensor (LAPS) based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) with high sensitivity and specificity. We observed the dynamic lamin A phosphorylation during the cell cycle progression in single living cells: the increase of pSer22 modification when cells entered the mitosis and recovered upon the mitosis exit. Our biosensor also showed the gradual reduction of pSer22 modification during cell adhesion and in response to hypotonic environment. By applying LAPS, we captured the propagation of pSer22 modification from inside to outside of the inner nuclear membrane, which further led to the breakdown of nuclear envelope. Meanwhile, we found the synchronous phosphorylation of pSer22 lamin A and H3S10ph at mitosis entry. Inhibition of Aurora B, the responsible kinase for H3S10ph, could shorten the mitotic period without obvious effect on the pSer22 modification level of lamin A. Thus, LAPS allows the spatiotemporal visualization of the lamin A pSer22, which will be useful for elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying cell mitosis and mechanoresponsive processes.",

        "abstract": "Real-time and non-invasive monitoring of neuronal differentiation will help increase our understanding of neuronal development and help develop regenerative stem cell therapies for neurodegenerative diseases. Traditionally, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), western blotting, and immunofluorescence (IF) staining have been widely used to investigate stem cell differentiation; however, their limitations include endpoint analysis, invasive nature of monitoring, and lack of single-cell-level resolution. Several limitations hamper current approaches to studying neural stem cell (NSC) differentiation. In particular, fixation and staining procedures can introduce artificial changes in cellular morphology, hindering our ability to accurately monitor the progression of the process and fully understand its functional aspects, particularly those related to cellular connectivity and neural network formation. Herein, we report a novel approach to monitor neuronal differentiation of NSCs non-invasively in real-time using cell-based biosensors (CBBs). Our research efforts focused on utilizing intein-mediated protein engineering to design and construct a highly sensitive biosensor capable of detecting a biomarker of neuronal differentiation, hippocalcin. Hippocalcin is a critical protein involved in neurogenesis, and the CBB functions by translocating a fluorescence signal to report the presence of hippocalcin externally. To construct the hippocalcin sensor proteins, hippocalcin bioreceptors, AP2 and glutamate ionotropic receptor AMPA-type subunit 2 (GRIA2), were fused to each split-intein carrying split-nuclear localization signal (NLS) peptides, respectively, and a fluorescent protein was introduced as a reporter. Protein splicing (PS) was triggered in the presence of hippocalcin to generate functional signal peptides, which promptly translocated the fluorescence signal to the nucleus. The stem cell-based biosensor showed fluorescence signal translocation only upon neuronal differentiation. Undifferentiated stem cells or cells that had differentiated into astrocytes or oligodendrocytes did not show fluorescence signal translocation. The number of differentiated neurons was consistent with that measured by conventional IF staining. Furthermore, this approach allowed for the monitoring of neuronal differentiation at an earlier stage than that detected using conventional approaches, and the translocation of fluorescence signal was monitored before the noticeable expression of class III β-tubulin (TuJ1), an early neuronal differentiation marker. We believe that these novel CBBs offer an alternative to current techniques by capturing the dynamics of differentiation progress at the single-cell level and by providing a tool to evaluate how NSCs efficiently differentiate into specific cell types, particularly neurons.",

Arc transcription is induced within a few minutes of stimulation, making it a useful marker for neuronal activity. However, the specific neuronal activity patterns that initiate Arc transcription have remained elusive due to the inability to observe mRNA transcription in live cells in real time. Using a genetically encoded RNA indicator (GERI) mouse model that expresses endogenous Arc mRNA tagged with multiple GFPs, we investigated Arc transcriptional activity in response to various electrical field stimulation patterns. The GERI mouse model was generated by crossing the Arc-PBS knock-in mouse, engineered with binding sites in the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of Arc mRNA, and the transgenic mouse expressing the cognate binding protein fused to GFP. In dissociated hippocampal neurons, we found that the pattern of stimulation significantly affects Arc transcription. Specifically, theta-burst stimulation consisting of high-frequency (100 Hz) bursts delivered at 10 Hz frequency induced the highest rate of Arc transcription. Concurrently, the amplitudes of nuclear calcium transients also reached their peak with 10 Hz burst stimulation, indicating a correlation between calcium concentration and transcription. However, our dual-color single-cell imaging revealed that there were no significant differences in calcium amplitudes between Arc-positive and Arc-negative neurons upon 10 Hz burst stimulation, suggesting the involvement of other factors in the induction of Arc transcription. Our live-cell RNA imaging provides a deeper insight into the complex regulation of transcription by activity patterns and calcium signaling pathways.",

        "abstract": "The objective of our study was to develop a genetically encoded biosensor for quantification of Nedd8, a post-translational modifier that regulates cellular signals through conjugation to other proteins. Perturbations in the balance of free (i.e., unconjugated) and conjugated Nedd8 caused by defects in Nedd8 enzymes or cellular stress are implicated in various diseases. Despite the biological and biomedical importance of Nedd8 dynamics, no method exists for direct quantification of free Nedd8, hindering the study of Nedd8 and activities of its associated enzymes. Genetically encoded biosensors are established as tools to study other dynamic systems, but limitations of current biosensor design methods make them poorly suited for free Nedd8 quantification. We have developed a modular method to design genetically encoded biosensors that employs a target binding domain and two reporter domains positioned on opposite sides of the target binding site. Target quantification is based on competition between target binding and the interaction of the reporter domains. We applied our design strategy to free Nedd8 quantification by developing a selective binder for free Nedd8 and combining it with fluorescent or split nanoluciferase reporters. Our sensors produced quantifiable and specific signals for free Nedd8 and enabled real-time monitoring of deneddylation by DEN1 with a physiological substrate. Our sensor design will be useful for high-throughput screening for deneddylation inhibitors, which have potential in treatment of cancers such as acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The modular design strategy can be extended to develop genetically encoded quantitative biosensors for other proteins of interest.",

        "abstract": "HeLa cell transfection with plasmid DNA (pDNA) is widely used to materialize biologicals and as a preclinical test of nucleic acid-based vaccine efficacy. We sought to genetically encode mammalian transfection sensor (Trensor) circuits and test their utility in HeLa cells for detecting molecules and methods for their propensity to influence transfection. We intended these Trensor circuits to be triggered if their host cell was treated with polyplexed pDNA or certain small-molecule modulators of transfection. We prioritized three promoters, implicated by others in feedback responses as cells import and process foreign material and stably integrated each into the genomes of three different cell lines, each upstream of a green fluorescent protein (GFP) open reading frame within a transgene. All three Trensor circuits showed an increase in their GFP expression when their host HeLa cells were incubated with pDNA and the degraded polyamidoamine dendrimer reagent, SuperFect. We next experimentally demonstrated the modulation of PEI-mediated HeLa cell transient transfection by four different small molecules, with Trichostatin A (TSA) showing the greatest propensity to boost transgene expression. The Trensor circuit based on the <i>TRA2B</i> promoter (Trensor-T) was triggered by incubation with TSA alone and not the other three small molecules. These data suggest that mammalian reporter circuits could enable low-cost, high-throughput screening to identify novel transfection methods and reagents without the need to perform actual transfections requiring costly plasmids or expensive fluorescent labels.",

A targeted nanoplatform based on HER2-specific liposomes whose internal environment contains a genetically encoded BRET sensor was developed in this study to visualize deep-seated tumors characterized by overexpression of human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (HER2).

In the present study, we investigated the effect of dopamine receptor activation on cAMP dynamics in astrocytes of the mouse olfactory bulb, the brain region with the largest population of dopaminergic neurons. Using the genetically encoded cAMP sensor Flamindo2 we visualized changes in the cytosolic cAMP concentration and showed that dopamine application results in a transient increase in cAMP. This cAMP increase could be mimicked by the D1-like receptor agonist A 68930 and was inhibited by the D1-like receptor antagonist SCH 23390, whereas D2-like receptor ligands had no effect on the astrocytic cAMP concentration.

The hermaphroditic nematode Caenorhabditis elegans provides several unique advantages for the study of the OET as it is transparent and has an ordered gonad that produces one mature oocyte every ~23 min at 20 °C. We have modified the genetically encoded calcium indicator jGCaMP7s to fluorescently indicate the moment of fertilization within a living organism. We have termed this reporter \"CaFE\" for Calcium during Fertilization in C. elegans. The CaFE reporter was engineered into a safe harbor locus in single copy, has no significant impact on physiology or fecundity, and produces a robust signal upon fertilization. Here, a series of protocols is presented for utilizing the CaFE reporter as an in vivo tool for dissecting the OET and embryogenesis. We include methods to synchronize worms, examine the effects of RNAi knockdown, mount worms for imaging, and to visualize calcium in oocytes and embryos. Additionally, we present the generation of additional worm strains to aid in this type of analysis. Demonstrating the utility of the CaFE reporter to visualize the timing of fertilization, we report that double ovulation occurs when ipp-5 is targeted by RNAi and that only the first oocyte undergoes immediate fertilization. Furthermore, the discovery of single-cell calcium transients during early embryogenesis is reported here, demonstrating that the CaFE reporter persists into early development. Importantly, the CaFE reporter in worms is simple enough to use for incorporation into course-based undergraduate research (CURE) laboratory classes. The CaFE reporter, coupled with the ordered gonad and ease of RNAi in worms, facilitates inquiry into the cell-cell dynamics required to regulate internal fertilization and early embryogenesis.",

Analyses with an improved channelrhodopsin-2 variant demonstrated that the peristalsis can artificially be generated in the developing gut. These studies unveiled novel functional coordination between different regions along the gut axis. In addition, imaging with GCaMP6s, a genetically encoded calcium indicator, enabled a fine mapping of developmental changes in the peristaltic patterns as Ca2+ signals.

Direct detection of these brief events using existing technologies remains challenging due to their transient nature. In addition, intrinsically disordered domains, intranuclear location, and lack of cofactor-dependent active sites of transcription factors further complicate the quantitative analysis of these critical processes. Here, we create a genetically encoded label-free sensor to identify the interaction between a motif of the MYC transcription factor, a primary cancer driver, and WDR5, a chromatin-associated protein hub. Using an engineered nanopore equipped with this motif, WDR5 is probed through reversible captures and releases in a one-by-one and time-resolved fashion. Our single-molecule kinetic measurements indicate a weak-affinity interaction arising from a relatively slow complex association and a fast dissociation of WDR5 from the tethered motif. Further, we validate this subtle interaction by determinations in an ensemble using single nanodisc-wrapped nanopores immobilized on a biolayer interferometry sensor. This study also provides the proof-of-concept for a sensor that reveals unique recognition signatures of different protein binding sites.

Genetically encoded fluorescent temperature indicators (GETIs) have been developed to visualize intracellular thermogenesis; however, the temperature sensitivity or localization capability in specific organelles should have been further improved to clearly capture when and where intracellular temperature changes at the subcellular level occur. Here, we developed a new GETI, gMELT, composed of donor and acceptor subunits, in which cyan and yellow fluorescent proteins, respectively, as a Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) pair were fused with temperature-sensitive domains. The donor and acceptor subunits associated and dissociated in response to temperature changes, altering the FRET efficiency. Consequently, gMELT functioned as a fluorescence ratiometric indicator. Untagged gMELT was expressed in the cytoplasm, whereas versions fused with specific localization signals were targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or mitochondria. All gMELT variations enabled more sensitive temperature measurements in cellular compartments than those in previous GETIs. The gMELTs, tagged with ER or mitochondrial targeting sequences, were used to detect thermogenesis in organelles stimulated chemically, a method previously known to induce thermogenesis. The observed temperature changes were comparable to previous reports, assuming that the fluorescence readout changes were exclusively due to temperature variations. Furthermore, we demonstrated how macromolecular crowding influences gMELT fluorescence given that this factor can subtly affect the fluorescence readout. Investigating thermogenesis with gMELT, accounting for factors such as macromolecular crowding, will enhance our understanding of intracellular thermogenesis phenomena.",

        "abstract": "During nutrient scarcity, plants can adapt their developmental strategy to maximize their chance of survival. Such plasticity in development is underpinned by hormonal regulation, which mediates the relationship between environmental cues and developmental outputs. In legumes, endosymbiosis with nitrogen-fixing bacteria (rhizobia) is a key adaptation for supplying the plant with nitrogen in the form of ammonium. Rhizobia are housed in lateral root-derived organs termed nodules that maintain an environment conducive to Nitrogenase in these bacteria. Several phytohormones are important for regulating the formation of nodules, with both positive and negative roles proposed for gibberellin (GA). In this study, we determine the cellular location and function of bioactive GA during nodule organogenesis using a genetically encoded second-generation GA biosensor, GIBBERELLIN PERCEPTION SENSOR 2 in Medicago truncatula. We find endogenous bioactive GA accumulates locally at the site of nodule primordia, increasing dramatically in the cortical cell layers, persisting through cell divisions, and maintaining accumulation in the mature nodule meristem. We show, through misexpression of GA-catabolic enzymes that suppress GA accumulation, that GA acts as a positive regulator of nodule growth and development. Furthermore, increasing or decreasing GA through perturbation of biosynthesis gene expression can increase or decrease the size of nodules, respectively. This is unique from lateral root formation, a developmental program that shares common organogenesis regulators. We link GA to a wider gene regulatory program by showing that nodule-identity genes induce and sustain GA accumulation necessary for proper nodule formation.",

Existing genetically encoded force sensors typically rely on fluorescence or bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (FRET or BRET) to visualize tension. However, these force sensing modules are relatively large, and interpreting measurements requires specialized image analysis and careful control experiments. Here, we report a compact molecular tension sensor that generates a bioluminescent signal in response to tension. This sensor (termed PILATeS) makes use of the split NanoLuc luciferase and consists of the <i>H. sapiens</i> titin I10 domain with the insertion of a 10-15 amino acid tag derived from the C-terminal β-strand of NanoLuc. Mechanical load across PILATeS mediates exposure of this tag to recruit the complementary split NanoLuc fragment, resulting in force-dependent bioluminescence. We demonstrate the ability of PILATeS to report biologically meaningful forces by visualizing forces at the interface between integrins and extracellular matrix substrates. We further use PILATeS as a genetically encoded sensor of tension experienced by the mechanosensing protein vinculin. We anticipate that PILATeS will provide an accessible means of visualizing molecular-scale forces in biological systems.",

Here, we developed a new genetically encoded fluorescent sensor, named PLpro-ERNuc, for detection of PLpro activity in living cells using a translocation-based readout. The sensor was designed as follows. A fragment of nsp3 protein was used to direct the sensor on the cytoplasmic surface of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, thus closely mimicking the natural target of PLpro. The fluorescent part included two bright fluorescent proteins-red mScarlet I and green mNeonGreen-separated by a linker with the PLpro cleavage site. A nuclear localization signal (NLS) was attached to ensure accumulation of mNeonGreen into the nucleus upon cleavage. We tested PLpro-ERNuc in a model of recombinant PLpro expressed in HeLa cells. The sensor demonstrated the expected cytoplasmic reticular network in the red and green channels in the absence of protease, and efficient translocation of the green signal into nuclei in the PLpro-expressing cells (14-fold increase in the nucleus/cytoplasm ratio). Then, we used PLpro-ERNuc in a model of Huh7.5 cells infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, where it showed robust ER-to-nucleus translocation of the green signal in the infected cells 24 h post infection. We believe that PLpro-ERNuc represents a useful tool for screening PLpro inhibitors as well as for monitoring virus spread in a culture.",

Herein, we introduce a multiplexed imaging strategy, 'sequential Fluorogenic RNA Imaging-Enabled Sensor' (seqFRIES), which enables live-cell target detection via sequential rounds of imaging-and-stripping. In seqFRIES, multiple orthogonal fluorogenic RNA aptamers are genetically encoded inside cells, and then the corresponding cell membrane permeable dye molecules are added, imaged, and rapidly removed in consecutive detection cycles. As a proof-of-concept, we have identified in this study four fluorogenic RNA aptamer/dye pairs that can be used for highly orthogonal and multiplexed imaging in living bacterial and mammalian cells. After further optimizing the cellular fluorescence activation and deactivation kinetics of these RNA/dye pairs, the whole four-color semi-quantitative seqFRIES process can be completed in ∼20 min. Meanwhile, seqFRIES-mediated simultaneous detection of critical signalling molecules and mRNA targets was also achieved within individual living cells. We expect our validation of this new seqFRIES concept here will facilitate the further development and potential broad usage of these orthogonal fluorogenic RNA/dye pairs for multiplexed and dynamic live-cell imaging and cell biology studies.",

We characterized the affinity, pharmacological profile, spectral properties, kinetics, ligand selectivity, and potential interaction with intracellular signal transducers of NOPLight in vitro. Its functionality was established in acute brain slices by exogeneous N/OFQ application and chemogenetic induction of endogenous N/OFQ release from PNOC neurons. In vivo studies with fibre photometry enabled direct recording of NOPLight binding to exogenous N/OFQ receptor ligands, as well as detection of endogenous N/OFQ release within the paranigral ventral tegmental area (pnVTA) during natural behaviors and chemogenetic activation of PNOC neurons.

Using two-photon functional imaging, we mapped the spatial activation patterns representing a wide range of ecologically relevant odors across all six developmental stages. Our findings reveal a functionally ring-shaped organization of the antennal lobe composed of specific glomerular clusters. This configuration establishes an odor-specific chemotopic representation by encoding different chemical classes and ecologically distinct odors in the form of glomerular rings. The ring-shaped glomerular arrangement, which we confirm by selective targeting of OR70a-expressing sensory neurons, occurs throughout development, and the odor-coding pattern within the glomerular population is consistent across developmental stages. Mechanistically, this unconventional spatial olfactory code reflects the locust-specific and multiplexed glomerular innervation pattern of the antennal lobe.",

Abnormalities in lysosomal function are closely linked to diseases, such as lysosomal storage disorders, neurodegeneration, intracellular infections, and cancer among others. Emerging body of research suggests the malfunction of lysosomal hydrolase trafficking pathway to be a common denominator of several disease pathologies. However, available conventional tools to assess lysosomal hydrolase trafficking are insufficient and fail to provide a comprehensive picture about the trafficking flux and location of lysosomal hydrolases. To address some of the shortcomings, we designed a genetically-encoded fluorescent reporter containing a lysosomal hydrolase tandemly tagged with pH sensitive and insensitive fluorescent proteins, which can spatiotemporally trace the trafficking of lysosomal hydrolases. As a proof of principle, we demonstrate that the reporter can detect perturbations in hydrolase trafficking, that are induced by pharmacological manipulations and pathophysiological conditions like intracellular protein aggregates.

Here we investigate responses of PV interneurons in different layers of primary somatosensory barrel cortex (BC) to different excitatory inputs. With the genetically-encoded hybrid voltage sensor, hVOS, we recorded voltage changes in many L2/3 and L4 PV interneurons simultaneously, with stimulation applied to either L2/3 or L4. A semi-automated procedure was developed to identify small regions of interest corresponding to single responsive PV interneurons.

Stimulation in L2/3 elicited responses in both L2/3 and L4 with longer latency compared to stimulation in L4.

To overcome these limitations and target neurons on the basis of specific PRTs for soma collection and subsequent single-cell RNA sequencing, we developed Voltage-Seq using the genetically encoded voltage indicator Voltron in acute brain slices from mice. We also created an onsite analysis tool, VoltView, to guide soma collection of specific PRTs using a classifier based on a previously acquired database of connectomes from multiple animals. Here we present our procedure for preparing the optical path, the imaging setup and detailing the imaging and analysis steps, as well as a complete procedure for sequencing library preparation. This enables researchers to conduct our high-throughput all-optical synaptic assay and to obtain single-cell transcriptomic data from selected postsynaptic neurons. This also allows researchers to resolve the connectivity ratio of a specific pathway and explore the diversity of PRTs within that connectome. Furthermore, combining high throughput with quick analysis gives unique access to find specific connections within a large postsynaptic connectome. Voltage-Seq also allows the investigation of correlations between connectivity and gene expression changes in a postsynaptic cell-type-specific manner for both excitatory and inhibitory connections.

Currently, there is a lack of genetically encoded fluorescence indicators (GEVIs) for MMP. In our screening of various GEVIs for their potential monitoring MMP, the Accelerated Sensor of Action Potentials (ASAP) demonstrated optimal performance in targeting mitochondria and sensitivity to depolarization in multiple cell types. However, mitochondrial ASAPs also displayed sensitivity to ROS in cardiomyocytes. Therefore, two ASAP mutants resistant to ROS were generated. A double mutant ASAP3-ST exhibited the highest voltage sensitivity but weaker fluorescence. Overall, four GEVIs capable of targeting mitochondria were obtained and named mitochondrial potential indicators 1-4 (MPI-1-4). In vivo, fiber photometry experiments utilizing MPI-2 revealed a mitochondrial depolarization during isoflurane-induced narcosis in the M2 cortex.",

However, an efficient tool for monitoring mTORC1 inhibition in living cells or tissues is lacking. We developed a genetically encoded mTORC1 sensor called TORSEL. This sensor changes its fluorescence pattern from diffuse to punctate when 4EBP1 dephosphorylation occurs and interacts with eIF4E. TORSEL can specifically sense the physiological, pharmacological, and genetic inhibition of mTORC1 signaling in living cells and tissues. Importantly, TORSEL is a valuable tool for imaging-based visual screening of mTORC1 inhibitors. Using TORSEL, we identified histone deacetylase inhibitors that selectively block nutrient-sensing signaling to inhibit mTORC1. TORSEL is a unique living cell sensor that efficiently detects the inhibition of mTORC1 activity, and histone deacetylase inhibitors such as panobinostat target mTORC1 signaling through amino acid sensing.",

        "abstract": "Octopamine (OA), analogous to norepinephrine in vertebrates, is an essential monoamine neurotransmitter in invertebrates that plays a significant role in various biological functions, including olfactory associative learning. However, the spatial and temporal dynamics of OA <i>in vivo</i> remain poorly understood due to limitations associated with the currently available methods used to detect it. To overcome these limitations, we developed a genetically encoded GPCR  activation-based (GRAB) OA sensor called GRAB<sub>OA1.0</sub>. This sensor is highly selective for OA and exhibits a robust and rapid increase in fluorescence in response to extracellular OA. Using GRAB<sub>OA1.0</sub>, we monitored OA release in the <i>Drosophila</i> mushroom body (MB), the fly's learning center, and found that OA is released in response to both odor and shock stimuli in an aversive learning model. This OA release requires acetylcholine (ACh) released from Kenyon cells, signaling via nicotinic ACh receptors. Finally, we discovered that OA amplifies aversive learning behavior by augmenting dopamine-mediated punishment signals via Octβ1R in dopaminergic neurons, leading to alterations in synaptic plasticity within the MB. Thus, our new GRAB<sub>OA1.0</sub> sensor can be used to monitor OA release in real time under physiological conditions, providing valuable insights into the cellular and circuit mechanisms that underlie OA signaling.",

An increasing amount of evidence suggests that intracellular calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) dynamics in oligodendrocytes mediates activity-dependent and activity-independent myelination. Unraveling how myelinating oligodendrocytes orchestrate and integrate Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals, particularly in relation to axonal firing, is crucial for gaining insights into their role in the CNS development and function, both in health and disease. In this framework, we used the recombinant adeno-associated virus/Olig001 capsid variant to express the genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator jGCaMP8s, under the control of the myelin basic protein promoter. In our study, this tool exhibits excellent tropism and selectivity for myelinating and mature oligodendrocytes, and it allows monitoring Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity in myelin-forming cells, both in isolated primary cultures and organotypic spinal cord explants. By live imaging of myelin Ca<sup>2+</sup> events in oligodendrocytes within organ cultures, we observed a rapid decline in the amplitude and duration of Ca<sup>2+</sup> events across different in vitro developmental stages. Active myelin sheath remodeling and growth are modulated at the level of myelin-axon interface through Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling, and, during early myelination in organ cultures, this phase is finely tuned by the firing of axon action potentials. In the later stages of myelination, Ca<sup>2+</sup> events in mature oligodendrocytes no longer display such a modulation, underscoring the involvement of complex Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in CNS myelination.",

        "abstract": "The accurate and rapid detection of blood lead concentration is of paramount importance for assessing human lead exposure levels. Fluorescent protein-based probes, known for their high detection capabilities and low toxicity, are extensively used in analytical sciences. However, there is currently a shortage of such probes designed for ultrasensitive detection of Pb<sup>2+</sup>, and no reported probes exist for the quantitative detection of Pb<sup>2+</sup> in blood samples. This study aims to fill this critical void by developing and evaluating a novel fluorescent protein-based probe that promises accurate and rapid lead quantification in blood. A simple and small-molecule fluorescent protein-based probe was successfully constructed herein using a peptide PbrBD designed for Pb<sup>2+</sup> recognition coupled to a single fluorescent protein, sfGFP. The probe retains a three-coordinate configuration to identify Pb<sup>2+</sup> and has a high affinity for it with a K<sub>d</sub>' of 1.48 ± 0.05 × 10<sup>-17</sup> M. It effectively transfers the conformational changes of the peptide to the chromophore upon Pb<sup>2+</sup> binding, leading to fast fluorescence quenching and a sensitive response to Pb<sup>2+</sup>. The probe offers a broad dynamic response range of approximately 37-fold and a linear detection range from 0.25 nM to 3500 nM. More importantly, the probe can resist interference of metal ions in living organisms, enabling quantitative analysis of Pb<sup>2+</sup> in the picomolar to millimolar range in serum samples with a recovery percentage of 96.64%-108.74 %. This innovative probe, the first to employ a single fluorescent protein-based probe for ultrasensitive and precise analysis of Pb<sup>2+</sup> in animal and human serum, heralds a significant advancement in environmental monitoring and public health surveillance. Furthermore, as a genetically encoded fluorescent probe, this probe also holds potential for the in vivo localization and concentration monitoring of Pb<sup>2+</sup>.",

In this study we explored the response of intracellular pH (pHi) to a one-minute CO2 pulse using a genetically encoded, ubiquitously expressed pH sensor, tpHusion, to monitor pHi within a live, intact, whole fly. We compared wild-type flies to flies lacking Imaginal disc growth factors (Idgfs), which are chitinase-like proteins that facilitate developmental processes and the innate immune response. Morphogenetic and cytoskeletal defects in Idgf-null flies are enhanced after CO2 exposure. We found that pHi drops sharply within seconds of the beginning of a CO2 pulse and recovers over several minutes. The initial profile was nearly identical in control and Idgf-null flies but diverged as the pHi returned to normal. This study demonstrates the feasibility of monitoring pH in live adult Drosophila.

        "abstract": "Hydrogen Peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) is a central oxidant in redox biology due to its pleiotropic role in physiology and pathology. However, real-time monitoring of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in living cells and tissues remains a challenge. We address this gap with the development of an optogenetic hydRogen perOxide Sensor (oROS), leveraging the bacterial peroxide binding domain OxyR. Previously engineered OxyR-based fluorescent peroxide sensors lack the necessary sensitivity and response speed for effective real-time monitoring. By structurally redesigning the fusion of Escherichia coli (E. coli) ecOxyR with a circularly permutated green fluorescent protein (cpGFP), we created a novel, green-fluorescent peroxide sensor oROS-G. oROS-G exhibits high sensitivity and fast on-and-off kinetics, ideal for monitoring intracellular H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> dynamics. We successfully tracked real-time transient and steady-state H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> levels in diverse biological systems, including human stem cell-derived neurons and cardiomyocytes, primary neurons and astrocytes, and mouse brain <i>ex vivo</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. These applications demonstrate oROS's capabilities to monitor H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> as a secondary response to pharmacologically induced oxidative stress and when adapting to varying metabolic stress. We showcased the increased oxidative stress in astrocytes via Aβ-putriscine-MAOB axis, highlighting the sensor's relevance in validating neurodegenerative disease models. Lastly, we demonstrated acute opioid-induced generation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> signal <i>in vivo</i> which highlights redox-based mechanisms of GPCR regulation. oROS is a versatile tool, offering a window into the dynamic landscape of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> signaling. This advancement paves the way for a deeper understanding of redox physiology, with significant implications for understanding diseases associated with oxidative stress, such as cancer, neurodegenerative, and cardiovascular diseases.",

However, the spatial and temporal dynamics of OA <i>in vivo</i> remain poorly understood due to limitations associated with the currently available methods used to detect it. To overcome these limitations, we developed a genetically encoded GPCR activation-based (GRAB) OA sensor called GRAB<sub>OA1.0</sub>. This sensor is highly selective for OA and exhibits a robust and rapid increase in fluorescence in response to extracellular OA. Using GRAB<sub>OA1.0</sub>, we monitored OA release in the <i>Drosophila</i> mushroom body (MB), the fly's learning center, and found that OA is released in response to both odor and shock stimuli in an aversive learning model. This OA release requires acetylcholine (ACh) released from Kenyon cells, signaling via nicotinic ACh receptors. Finally, we discovered that OA amplifies aversive learning behavior by augmenting dopamine-mediated punishment signals via Octβ1R in dopaminergic neurons, leading to alterations in synaptic plasticity within the MB. Thus, our new GRAB<sub>OA1.0</sub> sensor can be used to monitor OA release in real-time under physiological conditions, providing valuable insights into the cellular and circuit mechanisms that underlie OA signaling.",

We introduce a novel small molecule fluorescent agent, termed <b>SERTlight</b>, that specifically labels serotonergic neuronal cell bodies, dendrites, and axonal projections as a serotonin transporter (SERT) fluorescent substrate. SERTlight was developed by an iterative molecular design process, based on an aminoethyl-quinolone system, to integrate structural elements that impart SERT substrate activity, sufficient fluorescent brightness, and a broad absence of pharmacological activity, including at serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5HT) receptors, other G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), ion channels, and monoamine transporters. The high labeling selectivity is not achieved by high affinity binding to SERT itself but rather by a sufficient rate of SERT-mediated transport of SERTlight, resulting in accumulation of these molecules in 5HT neurons and yielding a robust and selective optical signal in the mammalian brain. SERTlight provides a stable signal, as it is not released via exocytosis nor by reverse SERT transport induced by 5HT releasers such as MDMA. SERTlight is optically, pharmacologically, and operationally orthogonal to a wide range of genetically encoded sensors, enabling multiplexed imaging. SERTlight enables labeling of distal 5HT axonal projections and simultaneous imaging of the release of endogenous 5HT using the GRAB<sub>5HT</sub> sensor, providing a new versatile molecular tool for the study of the serotonergic system.",

Thus, resolving voltage signals in non-excitable cells demands sensors with exceptionally high voltage sensitivity.

Using rEstus, it is uncovered that the membrane voltage in several non-excitable cell lines (A375, HEK293T, MCF7) undergoes spontaneous endogenous alterations on a second to millisecond timescale. Correlation analysis of these optically recorded voltage alterations provides a direct, real-time readout of electrical cell-cell coupling, showing that visually connected A375 and HEK293T cells are also largely electrically connected, while MCF7 cells are only weakly coupled. The presented work provides enhanced tools and methods for non-invasive voltage imaging in living cells and demonstrates that spontaneous endogenous membrane voltage alterations are not limited to excitable cells but also occur in a variety of non-excitable cell types.",

Conventionally, cyan and yellow fluorescent proteins have been often used as FRET pairs. Meanwhile, bathochromically shifted indicators with green and red fluorescent protein pairs have various advantages, such as low toxicity and autofluorescence in cells. However, it remains difficult to develop them with a similar level of dynamic range as cyan and yellow fluorescent protein pairs. To improve this, we used Gamillus, which has a unique trans-configuration chromophore, as a green fluorescent protein. Based on one of the best high-dynamic-range GECIs, Twitch-NR, we developed a GECI with 1.5-times higher dynamic range (253%), Twitch-GmRR, using RRvT as a red fluorescent protein. Twitch-GmRR had high brightness and photostability and was successfully applied for imaging the Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics in live cells.

Calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) transients mediated signaling is known to be essential in cytokinesis across eukaryotic cells. However, the detailed spatiotemporal dynamics of Ca<sup>2+</sup> during plant cytokinesis remain largely unexplored. In this study, we employed GCaMP5, a genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor, to investigate cytokinetic Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients during cytokinesis in Nicotiana tabacum Bright Yellow-2 (BY-2) cells. We validated the effectiveness of GCaMP5 to capture fluctuations in intracellular free Ca<sup>2+</sup> in transgenic BY-2 cells. Our results reveal that Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics during BY-2 cell cytokinesis are distinctly different from those observed in embryonic and yeast cells. It is characterized by an initial significant Ca<sup>2+</sup> spike within the phragmoplast region. This spike is followed by a decrease in Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration at the onset of cytokinesis in phragmoplast, which then remains elevated in comparison to the cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> until the completion of cell plate formation. At the end of cytokinesis, Ca<sup>2+</sup> becomes uniformly distributed in the cytosol. This pattern contrasts with the typical dual waves of Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes observed during cytokinesis in animal embryonic cells and fission yeasts. Furthermore, applications of pharmaceutical inhibitors for either Ca<sup>2+</sup> or microtubules revealed a close correlation between Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients and microtubule organization in the regulation of cytokinesis.

Influx of cerebrospinal fluid was associated with increased aquaporin-4 polarization along astrocytic endfeet and dilated meningeal lymphatic vessels. Inhibiting glymphatic clearance abolished the removal of amyloid by multisensory 40 Hz stimulation. Using chemogenetic manipulation and a genetically encoded sensor for neuropeptide signalling, we found that vasoactive intestinal peptide interneurons facilitate glymphatic clearance by regulating arterial pulsatility. Our findings establish novel mechanisms that recruit the glymphatic system to remove brain amyloid.",

We show that the genetically encoded calcium indicator GCaMP6s, delivered by the adeno-associated virus rAAV2/7, allows high-quality, stable, and long-term imaging of neuronal populations at single-cell and single-dendrite resolution in the pigeon forebrain. We demonstrate the utility of our setup by investigating the processing of colors in the visual Wulst, the avian homolog of the visual cortex. We report that neurons in the Wulst are color selective and display diverse response profiles to light of different wavelengths.

Synthetic biology offers promising solutions. However, progress in developing synthetic biology approaches is bottlenecked because it is challenging to measure lanthanide binding with current biochemical tools. Here we introduce LanTERN, a lanthanide-responsive fluorescent protein. LanTERN was designed based on GCaMP, a genetically encoded calcium indicator that couples the ion binding of four EF hand motifs to increased GFP fluorescence. We engineered eight mutations across the parent construct's four EF hand motifs to switch specificity from calcium to lanthanides. The resulting protein, LanTERN, directly converts the binding of 10 measured lanthanides to 14-fold or greater increased fluorescence.

Since arginine methylation is associated with cancer pathogenesis and progression, protein arginine methyltransferases have gained interest as targets for anti-cancer therapy. Despite considerable process made to elucidate (patho)physiological mechanisms regulated by arginine methylation, there remains a lack of tools to visualize arginine methylation with high spatiotemporal resolution in live cells. To address this unmet need, we generated an ArgMet-sensitive genetically encoded, Förster resonance energy transfer-(FRET) based biosensor, called GEMS, capable of quantitative real-time monitoring of ArgMet dynamics. We optimized these biosensors by using different ArgMet-binding domains, arginine-glycine-rich regions and adjusting the linkers within the biosensors to improve their performance. Using a set of mammalian cell lines and modulators, we demonstrated the applicability of GEMS for monitoring changes in arginine methylation with single-cell and temporal resolution.

We address this gap with the development of an optogenetic hydRogen perOxide Sensor (oROS), leveraging the bacterial peroxide binding domain OxyR. Previously engineered OxyR-based fluorescent peroxide sensors lack the necessary sensitivity or response speed for effective real-time monitoring. By structurally redesigning the fusion of Escherichia coli (E. coli) ecOxyR with a circularly permutated green fluorescent protein (cpGFP), we created a novel, green-fluorescent peroxide sensor oROS-G. oROS-G exhibits high sensitivity and fast on-and-off kinetics, ideal for monitoring intracellular H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> dynamics. We successfully tracked real-time transient and steady-state H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> levels in diverse biological systems, including human stem cell-derived neurons and cardiomyocytes, primary neurons and astrocytes, and mouse neurons and astrocytes in ex vivo brain slices.

We recently developed a series of genetically encoded fluorescent sensors for lactate, named FiLa, which illuminate lactate metabolism in cells, subcellular organelles, animals, and human serum and urine. In this protocol, we first describe the FiLa sensor-based strategies for real-time subcellular bioenergetic flux analysis by profiling the lactate metabolic response to different nutritional and pharmacological conditions, which provides a systematic-level view of cellular metabolic function at the subcellular scale for the first time. We also report detailed procedures for imaging lactate dynamics in live mice through a cell microcapsule system or recombinant adeno-associated virus and for the rapid and simple assay of lactate in human body fluids. This comprehensive multiscale metabolic analysis strategy may also be applied to other metabolite biosensors using various analytic platforms, further expanding its usability. The protocol is suited for users with expertise in biochemistry, molecular biology and cell biology. Typically, the preparation of FiLa-expressing cells or mice takes 2 days to 4 weeks, and live-cell and in vivo imaging can be performed within 1-2 hours.

In this work, we engineer an acetyl-CoA biosensor from the bacterial protein PanZ and circularly permuted green fluorescent protein (cpGFP). We biochemically characterize the sensor and demonstrate its selectivity for acetyl-CoA over other CoA species. We then deploy the biosensor in E. coli and HeLa cells to demonstrate its utility in living cells. In E. coli, we show that the biosensor enables detection of rapid changes in acetyl-CoA levels. In human cells, we show that the biosensor enables subcellular detection and reveals the compartmentalization of acetyl-CoA metabolism.",

Like all chytrids, <i>Bd</i> develops from a motile form into a sessile, growth form, a transition that involves drastic changes in its cytoskeletal architecture. Efforts to study <i>Bd</i> cell biology, development, and pathogenicity have been limited by the lack of genetic tools with which to test hypotheses about underlying molecular mechanisms. Here, we report the development of a transient genetic transformation system for <i>Bd</i>. We used electroporation to deliver exogenous DNA into <i>Bd</i> cells and detected transgene expression for up to three generations under both heterologous and native promoters. We also adapted the transformation protocol for selection using an antibiotic resistance marker. Finally, we used this system to express fluorescent protein fusions and, as a proof of concept, expressed a genetically encoded probe for the actin cytoskeleton. Using live-cell imaging, we visualized the distribution and dynamics of polymerized actin at each stage of the <i>Bd</i> life cycle, as well as during key developmental transitions.

        "abstract": "The voltage sensing domain (VSD) is a four-helix modular protein domain that converts electrical signals into conformational changes, leading to open pores and active enzymes. In most voltage sensing proteins, the VSDs do not interact with one another and the S1-S3 helices are considered mainly as scaffolding. The two exceptions are the voltage sensing phosphatase (VSP) and the proton channel (Hv). VSP is a voltage-regulated enzyme and Hvs are channels that only have VSDs. To investigate the S1 contribution to VSP function, we individually mutated four hydrophobic amino acids in S1 to alanine (F127, I131, I134 and L137). We also combined these mutations to generate quadruple mutation designated S1-Q. Most of these mutations shifted the voltage dependence of activity to higher voltages though interestingly, not all substrate reactions were the same. The kinetics of enzymatic activity were also altered with some mutations significantly slowing down dephosphorylation. The voltage dependence of VSD motions were consistently shifted to lower voltages and indicated a second voltage dependent motion. Co-immunoprecipitation demonstrated that none of the mutations broke the VSP dimer indicating that the S1 impact could stem from intrasubunit and/or intersubunit interactions. Lastly, when the same alanine mutations were introduced into a genetically encoded voltage indicator, they dramatically altered the optical readings, making some of the kinetics faster and shifting the voltage dependence. These results indicate that the S1 helix in VSP plays a critical role in tuning the enzymes conformational response to membrane potential transients and influencing the function of the VSD.",

However, recent findings of necroptosis, a programmed form of necrosis, shed a new light on necrosis. It has been challenging to detect necrosis reliably in vivo, partly due to the lack of genetically encoded sensors to detect necrosis. This is in stark contrast with the availability of many genetically encoded biosensors for apoptosis. Here we developed Necrosensor, a genetically encoded fluorescent sensor that detects necrosis in Drosophila, by utilizing HMGB1, which is released from the nucleus as a damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP). We demonstrate that Necrosensor is able to detect necrosis induced by various stresses in multiple tissues in both live and fixed conditions. Necrosensor also detects physiological necrosis that occurs during spermatogenesis in the testis. Using Necrosensor, we discovered previously unidentified, physiological necrosis of hemocyte progenitors in the hematopoietic lymph gland of developing larvae.

Sensors are commonly constructed by combining ligand-binding domains with one or more sensitized fluorescent protein (FP) domains. Sensors based on a single FP can be susceptible to artifacts caused by changes in sensor levels or distribution in vivo. To develop intensiometric sensors with the capacity for ratiometric quantification, dual-FP Matryoshka sensors were generated by using a single cassette with a large Stokes shift (LSS) reference FP nested within the reporter FP (cpEGFP). Here, we present a genetically encoded calcium sensor that employs green apple (GA) Matryoshka technology by incorporating a newly designed red LSSmApple fluorophore. LSSmApple matures faster and provides an optimized excitation spectrum overlap with cpEGFP, allowing for monochromatic coexcitation with blue light. The LSS of LSSmApple results in improved emission spectrum separation from cpEGFP, thereby minimizing fluorophore bleed-through and facilitating imaging using standard dichroic and red FP (RFP) emission filters. We developed an image analysis pipeline for yeast (<i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>) timelapse imaging that utilizes LSSmApple to segment and track cells for high-throughput quantitative analysis.

However, the classical quorum sensing paradigm is that Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria generally communicate via homoserine lactones (HSLs) or oligopeptide molecular signals, respectively, to elicit population responses. Here, we create synthetic HSL sensors for Gram-positive <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> 168 using allosteric LuxR-type regulators (RpaR, LuxR, RhlR, and CinR) and synthetic promoters. Promoters were combinatorially designed from different sequence elements (-35, -16, -10, and transcriptional start regions). We quantified the effects of these combinatorial promoters on sensor activity and determined how regulator expression affects its activation, achieving up to 293-fold activation. Using the statistical design of experiments, we identified significant effects of promoter regions and pairwise interactions on sensor activity, which helped to understand the sequence-function relationships for synthetic promoter design. We present the first known set of functional HSL sensors (≥20-fold dynamic range) in <i>B. subtilis</i> for four different HSL chemical signals: <i>p</i>-coumaroyl-HSL, 3-oxohexanoyl-HSL, <i>n</i>-butyryl-HSL, and <i>n</i>-(3-hydroxytetradecanoyl)-HSL.

These methods typically rely on genetically encoded sensors and actuators to monitor and control neural activity. For microendoscopic calcium imaging, injection of a virus followed by implantation of a lens probe is required to express a calcium sensor and enable optical access to the target brain region. This two-step process poses several challenges, chief among them being the risks associated with mistargeting and/or misalignment between virus expression zone, lens probe and target brain region. Here, we engineer an adeno-associated virus (AAV)-eluting polymer coating for gradient refractive index (GRIN) lenses enabling expression of a genetically encoded calcium indicator (GCaMP) directly within the brain region of interest upon implantation of the lens. This approach requires only one surgical step and guarantees alignment between GCaMP expression and lens in the brain. Additionally, the slow virus release from these coatings increases the working time for surgical implantation, expanding the brain regions and species amenable to this approach. These enhanced capabilities should accelerate neuroscience research utilizing optical methods and advance our understanding of the neural circuit mechanisms underlying brain function and behavior in health and disease.",

The high-throughput screening methods were developed based on detecting the concentration of intracellular calcium ions ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>) by using chemically synthesized dyes and genetically encoded calcium indicator (GECI). Meanwhile, the sensitivity and adaptability of these methods in the evaluation of capsaicinoids were also compared. A stable cell line co-expressing hTRPV1 and GCaMP6s was generated and used to establish a functional high-throughput screening assay based on the measurement of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> by fluorometric imaging plate reader (FLIPR). The GECI exhibited a higher sensitivity and applicability than that of chemically synthesized dyes in detecting the changes in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> induced by capsaicin. The CHO-hTRPV1-GCaMP6s cell line was further used to detect the dose-dependent relationships of various hTRPV1 agonists (comparison of EC<sub>5</sub>0 values: capsaicin (39 ± 1.67 nM) < nonivamide (67 ± 3.05 nM) < piperine (9222 ± 1851 nM)), and this order is consistent with the pharmacological properties of hTRPV1 activation by these agonists.

PAR plays a critical role in the DNA damage response (DDR) by acting as a signaling platform to promote the recruitment of DNA repair factors to the sites of DNA damage that bind via their PAR-binding domains (PBDs). Several classes of PBD families have been recognized, which identify distinct parts of the PAR chain. Proteins encoding PBDs play an essential role in conveying the PAR-mediated signal through their interaction with PAR chains, which mediates many cellular functions, including the DDR. The WWE domain identifies the iso-ADP-ribose moiety of the PAR chain. We recently described the WWE domain of RNF146 as a robust genetically encoded probe, when fused to EGFP, for detection of PAR in live cells. Here, we evaluated other PBD candidates as molecular PAR probes in live cells, including several other WWE domains and an engineered macrodomain. In addition, we demonstrate unique PAR dynamics when tracked by different PAR binding domains, a finding that that can be exploited for modulation of the PAR-dependent DNA damage response.",

Here, the vast mutational landscape of proteins constitutes a significant obstacle that slows GEFI development, particularly for sensors that rely on mammalian host systems for testing. To overcome these obstacles, we developed a multiplexed high-throughput engineering platform called the optogenetic microwell array screening system (Opto-MASS) that functionally tests thousands of GEFI variants in parallel in mammalian cells. Opto-MASS represents the next step for engineering optogenetic tools as it can screen large variant libraries orders of magnitude faster than current methods.

Expanding the selection of available GECIs to include new colors and distinct photophysical properties could create new opportunities for <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> fluorescence imaging of neuronal activity.

However, our understanding of how calcium signaling regulates AE is still incomplete. In particular, the interplay between intra-acrosomal calcium dynamics and the intermediate steps leading to AE is not well-defined. Here, we describe a method that provides spatial and temporal insights into acrosomal calcium dynamics and their relationship to membrane fusion and subsequent exocytosis of the acrosome vesicle. The method utilizes a novel transgenic mouse expressing an Acrosome-targeted Sensor for Exocytosis (AcroSensE). The sensor combines a genetically encoded calcium indicator (GCaMP) fused with mCherry. This fusion protein was specifically designed to enable the concurrent observation of acrosomal calcium dynamics and membrane fusion events. Real-time monitoring of acrosomal calcium dynamics and AE in live AcroSensE sperm is achieved using a combination of high frame-rate imaging and a stimulant delivery system that can target single sperm. This protocol also provides several examples of basic methods to quantify and analyze the raw data. Because the AcroSensE model is genetically encoded, its scientific significance can be augmented by using readily available genetic tools, such as crossbreeding with other mouse genetic models or gene-editing (CRISPR) based methods. With this strategy, the roles of additional signaling pathways in sperm capacitation and fertilization can be resolved. In summary, the method described here provides a convenient and effective tool to study calcium dynamics in a specific subcellular compartment-the sperm acrosome-and how those dynamics regulate the intermediate steps leading to membrane fusion and acrosome exocytosis.",

The phenomenon of macromolecular crowding is not an exclusive feature of the cytoplasm and can be observed in the densely protein-packed, nonhomogeneous cellular membranes and at the membrane interfaces. Crowding affects diffusional and conformational dynamics of proteins within the lipid bilayer, alters kinetic and thermodynamic properties of biochemical reactions, and modulates the membrane organization. Despite its importance, the non-invasive quantification of the membrane crowding is not trivial. Here, we developed a genetically-encoded fluorescence-based sensor for probing the macromolecular crowding at the membrane interfaces. Two sensor variants, both composed of fluorescent proteins and a membrane anchor, but differing by flexible linker domains were characterized in vitro, and the procedures for the membrane reconstitution were established. Steric pressure induced by membrane-tethered synthetic and protein crowders altered the sensors' conformation, causing increase in the intramolecular Förster's resonance energy transfer. Notably, the effect of protein crowders only weakly correlated with their molecular weight, suggesting that other factors, such as shape and charge contribute to the crowding via the quinary interactions. Finally, measurements performed in inner membrane vesicles of Escherichia coli validated the crowding-dependent dynamics of the sensors in the physiologically relevant environment. The sensors offer broad opportunities to study interfacial crowding in a complex environment of native membranes, and thus add to the toolbox of methods for studying membrane dynamics and proteostasis.",

This feature has significant implications for cancer immunotherapy, particularly in monitoring the efficacy of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cells. CAR-T cells are a promising therapy option for various cancer types, but monitoring their activity in vivo is challenging. The development of biosensors like CRSTAL provides a valuable tool for monitoring of CAR-T cell activity. In summary, CRSTAL is a highly sensitive biosensor that can detect GZMB activity in target cells, providing a means for evaluating the cytotoxic activity of immune cells and monitoring T cell activity in real time.",

Target RNAs can be specifically recognized with our sensor by forming perfectly complementary duplexes, which in turn can induce allosteric structural changes of the sensor to refold the native conformation of fluorogenic RNA aptamers.

Despite extensive studies on the regulation of nitrate uptake and downstream responses in various cells, our knowledge of the distribution of nitrogen forms in different root cell types and their cellular compartments is still limited. Previous physiological models have relied on in vitro biochemistry and metabolite level analysis, which limits the ability to differentiate between cell types and compartments. Here, to address this, we report a nuclear-localized, genetically encoded fluorescent biosensor, which we named nlsNitraMeter3.0, for the quantitative visualization of nitrate concentration and distribution at the cellular level in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>. This biosensor was specifically designed for nitrate measurements, not nitrite. Through genetic engineering to create and select sensors using yeast, <i>Xenopus</i> oocyte, and <i>Arabidopsis</i> expression systems, we developed a reversible and highly specific nitrate sensor. This method, combined with fluorescence imaging systems such as confocal microscopy, allows for the understanding and monitoring of nitrate transporter activity in plant root cells in a minimally invasive manner. Furthermore, this approach enables the functional analysis of nitrate transporters and the measurement of nitrate distribution in plants, providing a valuable tool for plant biology research. In summary, we provide a protocol for sensor development and a biosensor that can be used to monitor nitrate levels in plants. Key features This protocol builds upon the concept of FRET biosensors for in vivo visualization of spatiotemporal nitrate levels at a cellular resolution.

GEFIs are complex proteins with multiple dynamic states, rendering optimization by trial-and-error mutagenesis a challenging problem. We applied an alternative approach using machine learning to predict the outcomes of sensor mutagenesis by analyzing established libraries that link sensor sequences to functions. Using the GCaMP calcium indicator as a scaffold, we developed an ensemble of three regression models trained on experimentally derived GCaMP mutation libraries. We used the trained ensemble to perform an in silico functional screen on 1423 novel, uncharacterized GCaMP variants. As a result, we identified the novel ensemble-derived GCaMP (eGCaMP) variants, eGCaMP and eGCaMP+, that achieve both faster kinetics and larger fluorescent responses upon stimulation than previously published fast variants. Furthermore, we identified a combinatorial mutation with extraordinary dynamic range, eGCaMP2+, that outperforms the tested 6th, 7th, and 8th generation GCaMPs. These findings demonstrate the value of machine learning as a tool to facilitate the efficient pre-screening of mutants for functional characteristics. By leveraging the learning capabilities of our ensemble, we were able to accelerate the identification of promising mutations and reduce the experimental burden associated with trial-and-error mutagenesis.

Taking advantage of the calcium response that is a hallmark of sperm-egg fusion, we adapted the genetically encoded calcium indicator jGCaMP7s to visualize the moment of fertilization in Caenorhabditis elegans using fluorescence. We termed this tool the 'CaFE' reporter, for 'calcium during fertilization in C. elegans'. The CaFE reporter produced a robust signal that recapitulated the previously reported, biphasic nature of the calcium wave and had no significant deleterious effects on worm physiology or fecundity. Calcium waves were not observed at the restrictive temperature in the spe-9(hc88) strain, in which sperm can still trigger meiotic maturation but can no longer fuse with the oocyte. Demonstrating the utility of the CaFE reporter, we analyzed polyspermy induced by inhibition of egg-3 via RNAi and observed late calcium waves in the uterus. This finding provides support to the idea that calcium release is not restricted to the first sperm fusion event during polyspermy. Establishment of the CaFE reporter in the genetically tractable and optically transparent worm provides a powerful tool to dissect the oocyte-to-embryo transition inside a living animal.",

        "abstract": "Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is an abundantly expressed peptide in the nervous system. Its widespread distribution along with its receptors, both centrally and peripherally, indicates its broad functions in numerous biological processes. However, the low endogenous concentration and diffuse distribution of NPY make it challenging to study its actions and dynamics directly and comprehensively. Studies on the role of NPY have primarily been limited to exogenous application, transgene expression, or knock-out in biological systems, which are often combined with pharmacological probes to delineate the involvement of specific NPY receptors. Therefore, to better understand the function of NPY in time and space, direct visualization of the real-time dynamics of endogenous NPY is a valuable and desired tool. Using the first-generation and newly developed intensiometric green fluorescent G-protein-coupled NPY sensor (GRAB NPY1.0), we, for the first time, demonstrate and characterize the direct detection of endogenously released NPY in cultured cortical neurons. A dose-dependent fluorescent signal was observed upon exogenous NPY application in nearly all recorded neurons. Pharmacologically evoked neuronal activity induced a significant increase in fluorescent signal in 32% of neurons, reflecting the release of NPY, despite only 3% of all neurons containing NPY. The remaining pool of neurons expressing the sensor were either non-responsive or displayed a notable decline in the fluorescent signal. Such decline in fluorescent signal was not rescued in cortical cultures transduced with an NPY overexpression vector, where 88% of the neurons were NPY-positive. Overexpression of NPY did, however, result in sensor signals that were more readily distinguishable. This may suggest that biological factors, such as subtle changes in intracellular pH, could interfere with the fluorescent signal, and thereby underestimate the release of endogenous NPY when using this new sensor in its present configuration. However, the development of next-generation NPY GRAB sensor technology is expected soon, and will eventually enable much-wanted studies on endogenous NPY release dynamics in both cultured and intact biological systems.",

        "abstract": "The dynamics of phosphatidylserine in the plasma membrane is a tightly regulated feature of eukaryotic cells. Phosphatidylserine (PS) is found preferentially in the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane. Disruption of this asymmetry leads to the exposure of phosphatidylserine on the cell surface and is associated with cell death, synaptic pruning, blood clotting and other cellular processes. Due to the role of phosphatidylserine in widespread cellular functions, an efficient phosphatidylserine probe is needed to study them. Currently, a few different phosphatidylserine labelling tools are available; however, these labels have unfavourable signal-to-noise ratios and are difficult to use in tissues due to limited permeability. Their application in living tissue requires injection procedures that damage the tissue and release damage-associated molecular patterns, which in turn stimulates phosphatidylserine exposure. For this reason, we developed a novel genetically encoded phosphatidylserine probe based on the C2 domain of the lactadherin (MFG-E8) protein, suitable for labelling exposed phosphatidylserine in various research models. We tested the C2 probe specificity to phosphatidylserine on hybrid bilayer lipid membranes by observing surface plasmon resonance angle shift. Then, we analysed purified fused C2 proteins on different cell culture lines or engineered AAVs encoding C2 probes on tissue cultures after apoptosis induction. For in vivo experiments, neurotropic AAVs were intravenously injected into perinatal mice, and after 2 weeks, brain slices were collected to observe C2-SNAP expression. The biophysical analysis revealed the high specificity of the C2 probe for phosphatidylserine. The fused recombinant C2 proteins were suitable for labelling phosphatidylserine on the surface of apoptotic cells in various cell lines. We engineered AAVs and validated them in organotypic brain tissue cultures for non-invasive delivery of the genetically encoded C2 probe and showed that these probes were expressed in the brain in vivo after intravenous AAV delivery to mice. We have demonstrated that the developed genetically encoded PS biosensor can be utilised in a variety of assays as a two-component system of C2 and C2m2 fusion proteins. This system allows for precise quantification and PS visualisation at directly specified threshold levels, enabling the evaluation of PS exposure in both physiological and cell death processes.",

        "abstract": "There is great interest in developing boronolectins that are synthetic lectin mimics containing a boronic acid functional group for reversible recognition of diol-containing molecules, such as glycans and ribonucleotides. However, it remains a significant challenge to gain specificity. Here, we present a genetically encoded boronolectin which is a hybrid protein consisting of a noncanonical amino acid (ncAA) <i>p</i>-boronophenylalanine (<i>p</i>BoF), natural-lectin-derived peptide sequences, and a circularly permuted red fluorescent protein (cpRFP). The genetic encodability permitted a straightforward protein engineering process to derive a red fluorescent biosensor that can specifically bind uridine diphosphate <i>N</i>-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc), an important nucleotide sugar involved in metabolic sensing and cell signaling. We further characterized the resultant <u>b</u>oronic <u>a</u>cid- and <u>p</u>eptide-<u>a</u>ssisted <u>U</u>DP-<u>G</u>lcN<u>Ac</u> sensor (bapaUGAc) both in vitro and in live mammalian cells. Because UDP-GlcNAc in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus plays essential roles in glycosylating biomolecules in the secretory pathway, we genetically expressed bapaUGAc in the ER and Golgi and validated the sensor for its responses to metabolic disruption and pharmacological inhibition. In addition, we combined bapaUGAc with UGAcS, a recently reported green fluorescent UDP-GlcNAc sensor based on an alternative sensing mechanism, to monitor UDP-GlcNAc level changes in the ER and cytosol simultaneously. We expect our work to facilitate the future development of specific boronolectins for carbohydrates. In addition, this newly developed genetically encoded bapaUGAc sensor will be a valuable tool for studying UDP-GlcNAc and glycobiology.",

In addition, picosecond dynamics of intermolecular energy transfer in fluorescent proteins has been observed. Here, we present the development of a genetically encoded fluorescent sensor that can detect changes in hydrophobicity by monitoring ultrafast fluorescence depolarisation. Our sensor is composed of a pair of dimeric enhanced green fluorescent proteins (dEGFPs) linked by a flexible amino-acid linker. We show dimerisation is perturbed by the addition of glycerol which interferes with the hydrophobic interaction of the two proteins. Time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy revealed a systematic attenuation of ultrafast fluorescence depolarisation when the sensor was exposed to increasing glycerol concentrations. This suggests that as hydrophobicity increases, dEGFP pairing decreases within a tandem dimer. Un-pairing of the protein fluorophores dramatically alters the rate of energy transfer between the proteins, resulting in an increase in the limiting anisotropy of the sensor.",

However, the spatiotemporal dynamics of FAK activity in single FAs is unclear due to the lack of a robust FAK reporter, which limits our understanding of these essential biological processes. Here we have engineered a genetically encoded FAK activity sensor, dubbed FAK-separation of phases-based activity reporter of kinase (SPARK), which visualizes endogenous FAK activity in living cells and vertebrates. Our work reveals temporal dynamics of FAK activity during FA turnover. Most importantly, our study unveils polarized FAK activity at the distal tip of newly formed single FAs in the leading edge of a migrating cell. By combining FAK-SPARK with DNA tension probes, we show that tensions applied to FAs precede FAK activation and that FAK activity is proportional to the strength of tension. These results suggest tension-induced polarized FAK activity in single FAs, advancing the mechanistic understanding of cell migration.",

        "abstract": "The communication between neurons and, in some cases, between neurons and non-neuronal cells, through neurotransmission plays a crucial role in various physiological and pathological processes. Despite its importance, the neuromodulatory transmission in most tissues and organs remains poorly understood due to the limitations of current tools for direct measurement of neuromodulatory transmitters. In order to study the functional roles of neuromodulatory transmitters in animal behaviors and brain disorders, new fluorescent sensors based on bacterial periplasmic binding proteins (PBPs) and G-protein coupled receptors have been developed, but their results have not been compared to or multiplexed with traditional methods such as electrophysiological recordings. In this study, a multiplexed method was developed to measure acetylcholine (ACh), norepinephrine (NE), and serotonin (5-HT) in cultured rat hippocampal slices using simultaneous whole-cell patch clamp recordings and genetically encoded fluorescence sensor imaging. The strengths and weaknesses of each technique were compared, and the results showed that both techniques did not interfere with each other. In general, genetically encoded sensors GRAB<sub><i>NE</i></sub> and GRAB<sub>5<i>HT</i>1</sub>.<sub>0</sub> showed better stability compared to electrophysiological recordings in detecting NE and 5-HT, while electrophysiological recordings had faster temporal kinetics in reporting ACh. Moreover, genetically encoded sensors mainly report the presynaptic neurotransmitter release while electrophysiological recordings provide more information of the activation of downstream receptors. In sum, this study demonstrates the use of combined techniques to measure neurotransmitter dynamics and highlights the potential for future multianalyte monitoring.",

Successful application of GCaMP biosensors to a wide range of biological questions requires that sensor properties such as brightness and dynamic range, ligand affinity and response kinetics be tuned to the specific conditions or phenomena to be investigated. Random as well as rational targeted mutations of such sensor molecules have led to a number of important breakthroughs in this field, including the calcium sensors GCaMP6f and GCaMP6f<i><sub><i>u</i></sub></i>. jGCaMP8f of the most recently developed generation is promising a step-change in <i>in vivo</i> imaging with further increased fluorescence dynamic range.

Despite substantial advances in the field of neurotoxicology, there remain significant knowledge gaps in our understanding of cellular targets and molecular mechanisms that mediate the neurotoxicological endpoints associated with exposure to both legacy contaminants and emerging contaminants of concern. Zebrafish are a powerful neurotoxicological model given their high degree sequence conservation with humans and the similarities they share with mammals in micro- and macro-level brain structures. Many zebrafish studies have effectively utilized behavioral assays to predict the neurotoxic potential of different compounds, but behavioral phenotypes are rarely able to predict the brain structures, cell types, or mechanisms affected by chemical exposures. Calcium-modulated photoactivatable ratiometric integrator (CaMPARI), a recently developed genetically-encoded calcium indicator, undergoes a permanent green to red switch in the presence of elevated intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations and 405-nm light, which allows for a \"snapshot\" of brain activity in freely-swimming larvae. To determine whether behavioral results are predictive of patterns of neuronal activity, we assessed the effects of three common neurotoxicants, ethanol, 2,2',3,5',6-pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB 95), and monoethylhexyl phthalate (MEHP), on both brain activity and behavior by combining the behavioral light/dark assay with CaMPARI imaging. We demonstrate that brain activity profiles and behavioral phenotypes are not always concordant and, therefore, behavior alone is not sufficient to understand how toxicant exposure affects neural development and network dynamics. We conclude that pairing behavioral assays with functional neuroimaging tools such as CaMPARI provides a more comprehensive understanding of the neurotoxic endpoints of compounds while still offering a relatively high throughput approach to toxicity testing.",

A new dimension in protein imaging can be offered by combining protein tags with polarity-sensitive fluorescent probes, which provide information about local nanoscale environments of target proteins within the subcellular compartments (organelles). Here, we designed three fluorescent probes based on solvatochromic nile red dye, conjugated to a HaloTag reactive targeting group through polyethylene glycol linkers of varying lengths. The probe with medium linker length, NR12-Halo, was found to label specifically a large variety of proteins localized in defined cell compartments, such as plasma membranes (outer and inner leaflets), endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, cytosol, microtubules, actin, and chromatin. Owing to its polarity-sensitive fluorophore, the probe clearly distinguished the proteins localized within apolar lipid membranes from other proteins. Moreover, it revealed dramatic changes in the environment during the life cycle of proteins from biosynthesis to their expected localization and, finally, to recycling inside lysosomes. Heterogeneity in the local polarity of some membrane proteins also suggested a formation of low-polar protein aggregates, for example, within cell-cell contacts. The approach also showed that mechanical stress (cell shrinking by osmotic shock) induced a general polarity decrease in membrane proteins, probably due to the condensation of biomolecules. Finally, the nanoenvironment of some membrane proteins was affected by a polyunsaturated fatty acid diet, which provided the bridge between organization of lipids and proteins. The developed solvatochromic HaloTag probe constitutes a promising tool for probing nanoscale environments of proteins and their interactions within subcellular structures.",

Among them, ratiometric GECIs allow imaging of both active and non-active neuronal populations. However, they are not popular, since their properties are inferior to intensiometric GCaMP series of GECIs. The most characterized and developed ratiometric green GECI is FGCaMP7. However, the dynamic range and sensitivity of its large Stock's shift green (LSS-Green) form is significantly lower than its Green form and its molecular design is not optimal. To address these drawbacks, we engineered a ratiometric green calcium indicator, called FNCaMP, which is based on bright mNeonGreen protein and calmodulin from A. niger and has optimal NTnC-like design. We compared the properties of the FNCaMP and FGCaMP7 indicators in vitro, in mammalian cells, and in neuronal cultures. Finally, we obtained and analyzed X-ray structure of the FNCaMP indicator.",

        "abstract": "Single-cell detection of multiple target analytes is an important goal in cell biology. However, due to the spectral overlap of common fluorophores, multiplexed fluorescence imaging beyond two-to-three targets inside living cells remains a technical challenge. Herein, we introduce a multiplexed imaging strategy that enables live-cell target detection via sequential rounds of imaging-and-stripping process, which is named as \"sequential Fluorogenic RNA Imaging-Enabled Sensor\" (seqFRIES). In seqFRIES, multiple orthogonal fluorogenic RNA aptamers are genetically encoded inside cells, and then the corresponding cell membrane permeable dye molecules are added, imaged, and rapidly removed in consecutive detection cycles. As a proof-of-concept, we have identified in this study five <i>in vitro</i> orthogonal fluorogenic RNA aptamer/dye pairs (>10-fold higher fluorescence signals), four of which can be used for highly orthogonal and multiplexed imaging in living bacterial and mammalian cells. After further optimizing the cellular fluorescence activation and deactivation kinetics of these RNA/dye pairs, the whole four-color semi-quantitative seqFRIES process can now be completed in ~20 min. Meanwhile, seqFRIES-mediated simultaneous detection of two critical signaling molecules, guanosine tetraphosphate and cyclic diguanylate, was also achieved within individual living cells. We expect our validation of this new seqFRIES concept here will facilitate the further development and potential broad usage of these orthogonal fluorogenic RNA/dye pairs for highly multiplexed and dynamic cellular imaging and cell biology studies.",

H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> can diffuse across membranes, has a low reactivity, and is very stable. Deprotonated cysteine residues in proteins can be oxidized by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> into a highly reactive sulfenic acid derivative (-SOH), which can react with another cysteine to form a disulfide. Under higher oxidative stress the sulfenic acid undergo further oxidation to sulfinic acid (Cys-SO<sub>2</sub>H), which can subsequently be reduced. The sulfinic acid can be hyperoxidized to sulfonic acid (Cys-SO<sub>3</sub>H), whose reduction is irreversible. Formation of sulfenic acids can have a role in sensing oxidative stress, signal transduction, modulating localization and activity to regulate protein functions. Therefore, there is an emerging interest in trying to understand the pool of proteins that result in these sorts of modification in response to oxidative stress. This is known as the sulfenome and several approaches have been developed in animal and plant cells to analyze the sulfenome under different stress responses. These approaches can be proteomic, molecular, immunological (i.e., antibodies), or expressing genetically encoded probes that specifically react to sulfenic modifications. In this chapter, we describe an additional approach that allows visualization of sulfenic modification in vivo.

Under pathophysiological conditions, disturbances in these pools have been linked to altered intracellular communication and cellular dysfunction. To facilitate studies of subcellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in beta cells and, particularly, signaling between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria, we designed a novel dual Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor which we termed DS-1. DS-1 encodes two stoichiometrically fluorescent proteins within a single plasmid, G-CEPIA-er, targeted to the ER and R-CEPIA3-mt, targeted to mitochondria. Our goal was to simultaneously measure the ER and mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> in cells in real time. The <i>K<sub>ds</sub></i> of G-CEPIA-er and R-CEPIA3-mt for Ca<sup>2+</sup> are 672 and 3.7 μM, respectively. Confocal imaging of insulin-secreting INS-1 832/13 expressing DS-1 confirmed that the green and red fluorophores correctly colocalized with organelle-specific fluorescent markers as predicted. Further, we tested whether DS-1 exhibited the functional properties expected by challenging an INS-1 cell to glucose concentrations or drugs having well-documented effects on the ER and mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling. The data obtained were consistent with those seen using other single organelle targeted probes. These results taken together suggest that DS-1 is a promising new approach for investigating Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling within multiple organelles of the cell.",

Still, the exact mechanism governing magnesium transport by this protein complex is not well understood. Herein, we have developed a genetically encoded intracellular magnesium-specific reporter and demonstrate that the CNNM family inhibits the function of the TRPM7 magnesium channel. We show that the small GTPase ARL15 increases CNNM3/TRPM7 protein complex formation to reduce TRPM7 activity. Conversely, PRL-2 overexpression counteracts ARL15 binding to CNNM3 and enhances the function of TRPM7 by preventing the interaction between CNNM3 and TRPM7. Moreover, while TRPM7-induced cell signaling is promoted by PRL-1/2, it is reduced when CNNM3 is overexpressed. Lowering cellular magnesium levels reduces the interaction of CNNM3 with TRPM7 in a PRL-dependent manner, whereby knockdown of PRL-1/2 restores the protein complex formation. Cotargeting of TRPM7 and PRL-1/2 alters mitochondrial function and sensitizes cells to metabolic stress induced by magnesium depletion. These findings reveal the dynamic regulation of TRPM7 function in response to PRL-1/2 levels, to coordinate magnesium transport and reprogram cellular metabolism.",

Exosomes originating from cancer cells have promising biomarkers for the early detection and assessment of the therapeutic response to cancer. The exosomal epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a potential biomarker which is overexpressed in cancer; thus, the level of EGFR expression is investigated by so many methods in a liquid and solid biopsy. The optimal method for isolating pure exosomal EGFRs has not been well understood so far. Current approaches are complicated and time-consuming, therefore hampering their clinical applications. Here, we demonstrate the creation of an innovative fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) sensor, named ExoSen (exosome sensor), which can be implemented to determine the concentration of exosomal EGFRs at in vitro as well as in vivo levels. In this study, a sensing element for A549 exosomes, mitogen-inducible gene 6 (MIG6), has been employed between the FRET pair ECFP and Venus. MIG6 binding to ExoSen induced a conformational change that can be monitored by a variation in the FRET ratio. Moreover, the developed sensor, expressed in bacterial, yeast, and HEK-293T cells, demonstrates an increased FRET ratio with the addition of A549 exosomes, which can quantify the A549 exosomes noninvasively. The ExoSen enables rapid detection of A549 exosomes with great sensitivity at a concentration of 3.5 × 10<sup>9</sup> particles/mL. ExoSen is stable to pH fluctuations and provides a highly accurate, real-time optical readout in cell-based experiments by using confocal microscopy.",

Unfortunately, many HSCR patients have persistent dysmotility (e.g., constipation, incontinence) and enterocolitis after surgery, suggesting that the remaining bowel is not normal despite having ENS ganglia. Anatomical and neurochemical alterations have been observed in the ENS-innervated proximal bowel from HSCR patients and mice, but no studies have recorded ENS activity to define the circuit mechanisms underlying post-surgical HSCR dysfunction. Here, we generated a HSCR mouse model with a genetically-encoded calcium indicator to map the ENS connectome in the proximal colon. We identified abnormal spontaneous and synaptic ENS activity in proximal colons from GCaMP-Ednrb <sup>-/-</sup> mice with HSCR that corresponded to motor dysfunction. Many HSCR-associated defects were also observed in GCaMP-Ednrb <sup>+/-</sup> mice, despite complete ENS innervation. Results suggest that functional abnormalities in the ENS-innervated bowel contribute to post-surgical bowel complications in HSCR patients, and HSCR-related mutations that do not cause aganglionosis may cause chronic colon dysfunction in patients without a HSCR diagnosis.",

The genetically encoded sensor rapidly detects intracellular LC-acyl-CoAs generated from exogenous and endogenous fatty acids (FAs), as well as synthetic ABHD5 ligands. Stimulation of lipolysis in brown adipocytes elevated intracellular LC-acyl-CoAs in a cyclic fashion, which was eliminated by inhibiting PNPLA2 (ATGL), the major triglyceride lipase. Interestingly, inhibition of LC-acyl-CoA transport into mitochondria elevated intracellular LC-acyl-CoAs and dampened their cycling.

More importantly, the developing probe can timely and reversibly monitor changes of Hg<sup>2+</sup> concentration in living mammalian cells. The excellent performance of this probe is largely due to the recognition element of the probe, MerBD, which adopts an unusual planar trigonometric coordination configuration with Hg<sup>2+</sup>, and the coordination can cause enough conformational change to influence the fluorescence of skeleton protein sfGFP coupled with it. The small peptide MerBD was delicately designed based on the three-dimensional structure of metalloprotein MerR. This novel design strategy solves the challenging problems that there are few natural functional proteins in the process of constructing fluorescent probes for toxic metal ions and some functional proteins cannot be directly used as recognition elements. Based on the new strategy, more genetically encoded fluorescent probes of toxic heavy metal ions can be efficiently constructed and applied in the future.",

Selenium has pleiotropic effects like antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities; however, excess intake of selenium can imbalance such processes. The effects of selenium on human health are numerous and complex, demanding additional research to monitor the flux rate of selenium. Here, we have created a noninvasive and highly efficient genetically encoded fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based nanosensor, SelFS (<b>Sel</b>enium <b>F</b>RET-<b>S</b>ensor), for real-time monitoring of selenium at the cellular and subcellular levels. The construct of the nanosensor contains a selenium-binding protein (SeBP) as the selenium-detecting element inserted between the green fluorescent protein variants enhanced cyan fluorescent protein and Venus. In the presence of selenium, SelFS brings a conformational change, which is seen in the form of FRET. <i>In vitro</i> studies showed that SelFS is highly specific and selective for selenium and stable at an altered pH range from 5.0 to 8.0. SelFS is a flexible and dynamic tool for the detection of selenium in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes in a noninvasive way, with a binding constant (<i>K</i> <sub>d</sub>) of 0.198 × 10<sup>-6</sup> M as compared to its mutants.

However, it remains a significant challenge to gain specificity. Here, we present a genetically encoded boronolectin, which is a hybrid protein consisting of a noncanonical amino acid (ncAA) p-boronophenylalanine (pBoF), natural-lectin-derived peptide sequences, and a circularly permuted red fluorescent protein (cpRFP). The genetic encodability permitted a straightforward protein engineering process to derive a red fluorescent biosensor that can specifically bind uridine diphosphate N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc), an important nucleotide sugar involved in metabolic sensing and cell signaling. We further characterized the resultant boronic acid-and peptide-assisted UDP-GlcNAc sensor (bapaUGAc) both in vitro and in live mammalian cells. Because UDP-GlcNAc in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus plays essential roles in glycosylating biomolecules in the secretory pathway, we genetically expressed bapaUGAc in the ER and Golgi and validated the sensor for its responses to metabolic disruption and pharmacological inhibition. In addition, we combined bapaUGAc with UGAcS, a recently reported green fluorescent UDP-GlcNAc sensor based on an alternative sensing mechanism, to monitor UDP-GlcNAc level changes in the ER and cytosol simultaneously. We expect our work to facilitate the future development of specific boronolectins for carbohydrates. In addition, this newly developed genetically encoded bapaUGAc sensor will be a valuable tool for studying UDP-GlcNAc and glycobiology.",

        "abstract": "Adenosine 5' triphosphate (ATP) is the energy currency of life, which is produced in mitochondria (~90%) and cytosol (less than 10%). Real-time effects of metabolic changes on cellular ATP dynamics remain indeterminate. Here we report the design and validation of a genetically encoded fluorescent ATP indicator that allows for real-time, simultaneous visualization of cytosolic and mitochondrial ATP in cultured cells. This dual-ATP indicator, called smacATPi (simultaneous mitochondrial and cytosolic ATP indicator), combines previously described individual cytosolic and mitochondrial ATP indicators. The use of smacATPi can help answer biological questions regarding ATP contents and dynamics in living cells. As expected, 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG, a glycolytic inhibitor) led to substantially decreased cytosolic ATP, and oligomycin (a complex V inhibitor) markedly decreased mitochondrial ATP in cultured HEK293T cells transfected with smacATPi. With the use of smacATPi, we can also observe that 2-DG treatment modestly attenuates mitochondrial ATP and oligomycin reduces cytosolic ATP, indicating the subsequent changes of compartmental ATP. To evaluate the role of ATP/ADP carrier (AAC) in ATP trafficking, we treated HEK293T cells with an AAC inhibitor, Atractyloside (ATR). ATR treatment attenuated cytosolic and mitochondrial ATP in normoxia, suggesting AAC inhibition reduces ADP import from the cytosol to mitochondria and ATP export from mitochondria to cytosol. In HEK293T cells subjected to hypoxia, ATR treatment increased mitochondrial ATP along with decreased cytosolic ATP, implicating that ACC inhibition during hypoxia sustains mitochondrial ATP but may not inhibit the reversed ATP import from the cytosol. Furthermore, both mitochondrial and cytosolic signals decrease when ATR is given in conjunction with 2-DG in hypoxia. Thus, real-time visualization of spatiotemporal ATP dynamics using smacATPi provides novel insights into how cytosolic and mitochondrial ATP signals respond to metabolic changes, providing a better understanding of cellular metabolism in health and disease.",

Here, we developed the first pan-neuronal genetic driver in a Hymenopteran model organism, the honey bee, and expressed the calcium indicator GCaMP6f under the control of the honey bee synapsin promoter. We show that GCaMP6f is widely expressed in the honey bee brain, allowing to record neural activity from multiple brain regions. To assess the power of this tool, we focused on the olfactory system, recording simultaneous responses from the antennal lobe, and from the more poorly investigated lateral horn (LH) and mushroom body (MB) calyces. Neural responses to 16 distinct odorants demonstrate that odorant quality (chemical structure) and quantity are faithfully encoded in the honey bee antennal lobe. In contrast, odor coding in the LH departs from this simple physico-chemical coding, supporting the role of this structure in coding the biological value of odorants. We further demonstrate robust neural responses to several bee pheromone odorants, key drivers of social behavior, in the LH. Combined, these brain recordings represent the first use of a neurogenetic tool for recording large-scale neural activity in a eusocial insect and will be of utility in assessing the neural underpinnings of olfactory and other sensory modalities and of social behaviors and cognitive abilities.",

Monitoring and silencing peptidergic and glutamatergic transmissions from presynaptic terminals using our newly developed tools and existing genetic tools, respectively, reveal that neuropeptides, not glutamate, are the primary transmitter in encoding unconditioned stimulus during Pavlovian threat learning.

        "abstract": "Glutathione (GSH), the constituent of the redox buffer system, is a scavenger of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and its ratio to oxidized glutathione (GSSG) is a key indicator of oxidative stress in the cell. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a highly aggressive hematopoietic malignancy characterized by aberrant levels of reduced and oxidized GSH due to oxidative stress. Therefore, the real-time, dynamic, and highly sensitive detection of GSH/GSSG in AML cells is of great interest for the clinical diagnosis and treatment of leukemia. The application of genetically encoded sensors to monitor GSH/GSSG levels in AML cells is not explored, and the underlying mechanism of how the drugs affect GSH/GSSG dynamics remains unclear. In this study, we developed subcellular compartment-specific sensors to monitor GSH/GSSG combined with high-resolution fluorescence microscopy that provides insights into basal GSH/GSSG levels in the cytosol, mitochondria, nucleus, and endoplasmic reticulum of AML cells, in a decreasing order, revealing substantial heterogeneity of GSH/GSSG level dynamics in different subcellular compartments. Further, we investigated the response of GSH/GSSG ratio in AML cells caused by Prussian blue and Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> nanoparticles, separately and in combination with cytarabine, pointing to steep gradients. Moreover, cytarabine and doxorubicin downregulated the GSH/GSSG levels in different subcellular compartments. Similarly, live-cell imaging showed a compartment-specific decrease in response to various drugs, such as CB-839, parthenolide (PTL), and piperlongumine (PLM). The enzymatic activity assay revealed the mechanism underlying fluctuations in GSH/GSSG levels in different subcellular compartments mediated by these drugs in the GSH metabolic pathway, suggesting some potential therapeutic targets in AML cells.",

        "abstract": "Hepatocytes were the first cell type for which oscillations of cytoplasmic calcium levels in response to hormones were described. Since then, investigation of calcium dynamics in liver explants and culture has greatly increased our understanding of calcium signaling. A bottleneck, however, exists in observing calcium dynamics in a noninvasive manner because of the optical inaccessibility of the mammalian liver. Here, we aimed to take advantage of the transparency of the zebrafish larvae to image hepatocyte calcium dynamics in vivo at cellular resolution. We developed a transgenic model expressing a calcium sensor, GCaMP6s, specifically in zebrafish hepatocytes. Using this, we provide a quantitative assessment of intracellular calcium dynamics during multiple contexts, including growth, feeding, ethanol-induced stress, and cell ablation. Specifically, we show that synchronized calcium oscillations are present in vivo , which are lost upon starvation. Starvation induces lipid accumulation in the liver. Feeding recommences calcium waves in the liver, but in a spatially restricted manner, as well as resolves starvation-induced hepatic steatosis. By using a genetically encoded scavenger for calcium, we show that dampening of calcium signaling accelerates the accumulation of starvation-related lipid droplets in the liver. Furthermore, ethanol treatment, as well as cell ablation, induces calcium flux, but with different dynamics. The former causes asynchronous calcium oscillations, whereas the latter leads to a single calcium spike. We demonstrate the presence of oscillations, waves, and spikes in vivo . Calcium waves are present in response to nutrition and negatively regulate starvation-induced accumulation of lipid droplets.",

        "abstract": "Calcium-modulated photoactivatable ratiometric integrator (CaMPARI) is a calcium ion (Ca<sup>2+</sup>)- and light-dependent genetically encoded fluorescent activity integrator that can capture snapshots of neuronal activity through an irreversible process known as photoconversion. This unique property was previously used to label neurons based upon their tuning properties in order to map synaptic connectivity and to record large-scale neuronal activity in freely moving mice without attaching any mechanical device to them. The latest version of CaMPARI (CaMPARI2) was engineered to enhance the contrast generated by photoconverting the green protein to the activity-dependent red form and to reduce the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent photoconversion rate compared to the first generation of CaMPARI (CaMPARI1). However, here we show that this optimization process also resulted in reduced photoconversion efficiency of active neurons in the mouse cortex and hippocampus. Through side-by-side comparison of the two CaMPARI sensors under several experimental conditions, we show that CaMPARI1 exhibits a substantially higher red-to-green ratio in active cells than CaMPARI2. In addition, we show that CaMPARI1 also functions as a more sensitive traditional Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor than CaMPARI2 by producing larger activity-driven dynamic fluorescence changes in the observed neurons. Therefore, we conclude that during the optimization process of CaMPARI2, some of the sensor's characteristics were not predicted properly by <i>in vitro</i> screening assays, and therefore <i>in vivo</i> screening and validation steps should be included in future optimization attempts to increase the predictability of screening pipelines.",

An involvement of TRPC1 channels in cardiac diseases is widely established. However, the physiological role of TRPC1 channels and the mechanisms through which they contribute to disease development are still under investigation. Our prior work suggested that TRPC1 forms Ca<sup>2+</sup> leak channels located in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) membrane. Prior studies suggested that TRPC1 channels in the cell membrane are mechanosensitive, but this was not yet investigated in cardiomyocytes or for SR localized TRPC1 channels. We applied adenoviral transfection to overexpress or suppress TRPC1 expression in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVMs). Transfections were evaluated with RT-qPCR, western blot, and fluorescent imaging. Single-molecule localization microscopy revealed high colocalization of exogenously expressed TRPC1 and the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup> ATPase (SERCA2). To test our hypothesis that TRPC1 channels contribute to mechanosensitive Ca<sup>2+</sup> SR leak, we directly measured SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>SR</sub>) using adenoviral transfection with a novel ratiometric genetically encoded SR-targeting Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor. We performed fluorescence imaging to quantitatively assess [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>SR</sub> and leak through TRPC1 channels of NRVMs cultured on stretchable silicone membranes.

A FbFP derived from <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> (CreiLOV) is a promising platform for designing new metal sensors. Some FbFPs are intrinsically quenched by metal ions, but the question of where metals bind and how to tune metal affinity has not been addressed. We used site-directed mutagenesis of CreiLOV to probe a hypothesized copper(II) binding site that led to fluorescence quenching. Most mutations changed the fluorescence quenching level, supporting the proposed site. One key mutation introducing a second cysteine residue in place of asparagine (CreiLOV<sub>N41C</sub>) significantly altered metal affinity and selectivity, yielding a zinc sensor. The fluorescence intensity and lifetime of CreiLOV<sub>N41C</sub> were reversibly quenched by Zn<sup>2+</sup> ions with a biologically relevant affinity (apparent dissociation constant, <i>K</i><sub>d</sub>, of 1 nM). Copper quenching of CreiLOV<sub>N41C</sub> was retained but with several orders of magnitude higher affinity than CreiLOV (<i>K</i><sub>d</sub> = 0.066 fM for Cu<sup>2+</sup>, 5.4 fM for Cu<sup>+</sup>) and partial reversibility.

        "abstract": "Heme is both an essential cofactor and an abundant source of nutritional iron for the human pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis. While heme is required for M. tuberculosis survival and virulence, it is also potentially cytotoxic. Since M. tuberculosis can both synthesize and take up heme, the <i>de novo</i> synthesis of heme and its acquisition from the host may need to be coordinated in order to mitigate heme toxicity. However, the mechanisms employed by M. tuberculosis to regulate heme uptake, synthesis, and bioavailability are poorly understood. By integrating ratiometric heme sensors with mycobacterial genetics, cell biology, and biochemistry, we determined that <i>de novo</i>-synthesized heme is more bioavailable than exogenously scavenged heme, and heme availability signals the downregulation of heme biosynthetic enzyme gene expression. Ablation of heme synthesis does not result in the upregulation of known heme import proteins. Moreover, we found that <i>de novo</i> heme synthesis is critical for survival from macrophage assault. Altogether, our data suggest that mycobacteria utilize heme from endogenous and exogenous sources differently and that targeting heme synthesis may be an effective therapeutic strategy to treat mycobacterial infections. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Mycobacterium tuberculosis infects ~25% of the world's population and causes tuberculosis (TB), the second leading cause of death from infectious disease. Heme is an essential metabolite for M. tuberculosis, and targeting the unique heme biosynthetic pathway of M. tuberculosis could serve as an effective therapeutic strategy. However, since M. tuberculosis can both synthesize and scavenge heme, it was unclear if inhibiting heme synthesis alone could serve as a viable approach to suppress M. tuberculosis growth and virulence. The importance of this work lies in the development and application of genetically encoded fluorescent heme sensors to probe bioavailable heme in M. tuberculosis and the discovery that endogenously synthesized heme is more bioavailable than exogenously scavenged heme. Moreover, it was found that heme synthesis protected M. tuberculosis from macrophage killing, and bioavailable heme in M. tuberculosis is diminished during macrophage infection. Altogether, these findings suggest that targeting M. tuberculosis heme synthesis is an effective approach to combat M. tuberculosis infections.",

The acoustic signal can last for up to 25 min, while the near-infrared fluorescence signal can last for up to 96 h. The combination of different imaging modalities in the tumor-homing bacteria may contribute to the non-invasive monitoring of the therapeutic effect of bacterial therapy in the future.",

Here we identify the primary nitrate sensor in plants. We found that mutation of all seven <i>Arabidopsis</i> NIN-like protein (NLP) transcription factors abolished plants' primary nitrate responses and developmental programs. Analyses of NIN-NLP7 chimeras and nitrate binding revealed that NLP7 is derepressed upon nitrate perception via its amino terminus. A genetically encoded fluorescent split biosensor, mCitrine-NLP7, enabled visualization of single-cell nitrate dynamics in planta. The nitrate sensor domain of NLP7 resembles the bacterial nitrate sensor NreA. Substitutions of conserved residues in the ligand-binding pocket impaired the ability of nitrate-triggered NLP7 to control transcription, transport, metabolism, development, and biomass.

A major challenge impeding the implementation of this strategy has been the difficulty to engineer the necessary whole-cell biosensors. Creation of transcription factor-based biosensors in a clinically-relevant strain often requires significant tuning of the genetic parts and gene expression to achieve the dynamic range and sensitivity required. Here, we propose an approach to efficiently engineer transcription-factor based metabolite biosensors that uses a design prototyping construct to quickly assay the gene expression design space and identify an optimal genetic design. We demonstrate this approach using the probiotic bacterium <i>Escherichia coli</i> Nissle 1917 (EcN) and two neuroactive gut metabolites: the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and the short-chain fatty acid propionate. The EcN propionate sensor, utilizing the PrpR transcriptional activator from <i>E. coli</i>, has a large 59-fold dynamic range and >500-fold increased sensitivity that matches biologically-relevant concentrations<i>.</i> Our EcN GABA biosensor uses the GabR transcriptional repressor from <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> and a synthetic GabR-regulated promoter created in this study. This work reports the first known synthetic microbial whole-cell biosensor for GABA, which has an observed 138-fold activation in EcN at biologically-relevant concentrations. Using this rapid design prototyping approach, we engineer highly functional biosensors for specified <i>in vivo</i> metabolite concentrations that achieve a large dynamic range and high output promoter activity upon activation.

Apoptosis is a well-studied model of cell death wherein the cell destroys itself employing a predefined form of active signaling without the release of soluble cytoplasmic contents to the external environment. Compared to apoptosis, necrosis is a nonspecific form of sudden cell death in response to an invasive external stimulus which in turn is devoid of active programmed intracellular signaling leading to the sudden release of the soluble cellular contents consequent to the rupture of the cell membrane. This fundamental difference between apoptosis and necrosis made us believe that the former is the safe form of cell death and the latter is an undesirable one which often elicits an inflammatory response to the adjacent cells. Recent studies have shown that necrosis also involves a few defined cellular and complex biochemical events similar to apoptosis rendering it difficult to distinguish these two events at the single-cell level using the currently used popular assays.Here we provide a newly described detailed methodology encompassing cell system development along with a multiparametric flow cytometry-based approach to discriminate apoptotic cells from necrotic cells using a stable cell line expressing genetically encoded probe for detecting caspase activation and DsRed targeted at the mitochondria.",

However, most existing fluorescent protein-based BiFC (FP-BiFC) assays still suffer from relatively low specificity or imaging signal-to-noise (S/N) ratios. Thus, developing high S/N ratio BiFC probes, especially in the widely used bright green-yellow region of the spectrum is very meaningful. In addition, synthetic engineering of BiFC probes which can be readily used for multiplexing imaging is also highly valuable for uncovering more or new layers of information on PPIs. In this report, we developed a bright stable green fluorescent protein Springgreen-M based on our previously evolved fast reversible photoswitching fluorescent protein (RSFP) GMars-T. We then established a novel BiFC assay based on Springgreen-M for imaging PPIs in live cells with high specificity. Combined with the same lineage, BiFC assays readily developed from photoconvertible fluorescent protein mMaple3 or reversibly photoswitchable fluorescent protein GMars-T, high specificity multiplexing imaging of PPIs could also be realized in the same live cell. Thus, our newly developed Springgreen-M and Springgreen-M-based BiFC probes will meet the urgent need for high-specificity BiFC detection, flexible visualization and screening of PPIs in live cells.",

We demonstrate that JEDI-2P can report light-evoked responses in axonal termini of Drosophila interneurons and the dendrites and somata of amacrine cells of isolated mouse retina. JEDI-2P can also optically record the voltage dynamics of individual cortical neurons in awake behaving mice for more than 30 min using both resonant-scanning and ULoVE random-access microscopy.

        "abstract": "Developing sensory modules for specific molecules of interest represents a fundamental challenge in synthetic biology and its applications. A somewhat generalizable approach for this challenge is demonstrated here by evolving a naturally occurring chemically induced heterodimer into a genetically encoded sensor for herbicides. The interaction between PYRABACTIN-RESISTANT-like receptors and type-2C protein phosphatases is induced by abscisic acid─a small-molecule hormone in plants. We considered abscisic acid receptors as a potential scaffold for the development of biosensors because of past successes in their engineering, a structurally defined ligand cavity and the availability of large-scale assays for their activation. A panel of 475 receptor variants, mutated at ligand-proximal residues, was screened for activation by 37 herbicides from several classes. Twelve compounds activated at least one member of the mutant panel. To facilitate the subsequent improvement of herbicide receptors through directed evolution, we engineered a yeast two-hybrid platform optimized for sequential positive and negative selection using fluorescence-activated cell sorting. By utilizing this system, we were able to isolate receptors with low nanomolar sensitivity and a broad dynamic range in sensing a ubiquitous group of chloroacetamide herbicides. Aside from its possible applicative value, this work lays down conceptual groundwork and provides infrastructure for the future development of biosensors through directed evolution.",

This work is devoted to the proof of principle of using photoconvertible proteins to measure caspase enzymatic activity in a single live cell. The advantage of this approach is that partial photoconversion of the FP makes FCS measurements possible when studying enzymatic reactions. To investigate the process, in vivo we used HeLa cell line expressing the engineered FRET sensor, SAASoti-23-KFP. This FRET sensor has a cleavable (DEVD) sequence in the linker between two FPs for the detection of one of the key enzymes of apoptosis, caspase-3. Caspase-3 activity was detected by registering the increase in the fluorescent lifetimes of the sensor, whereas the diffusion coefficient of SAASoti decreased. This can be explained by an increase in the total cell viscosity during apoptosis. We can suppose that in the moment of detectible caspase-3 activity, cell structure already has crucial changes in viscosity.",

Here, we designed two genetically encoded fluorescent sensors for the real-time detection of PLpro activity in live cells. The first sensor was based on the Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) between the red fluorescent protein mScarlet as a donor and the biliverdin-binding near-infrared fluorescent protein miRFP670 as an acceptor. A linker with the PLpro recognition site LKGG in between made this FRET pair sensitive to PLpro cleavage. Upon the co-expression of mScarlet-LKGG-miRFP670 and PLpro in HeLa cells, we observed a gradual increase in the donor fluorescence intensity of about 1.5-fold. In the second sensor, both PLpro and its target-green mNeonGreen and red mScarletI fluorescent proteins separated by an LKGG-containing linker-were attached to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. Upon cleavage by PLpro, mScarletI diffused from the ER throughout the cell. About a two-fold increase in the nucleus/cytoplasm ratio was observed as a result of the PLpro action.

        "abstract": "The baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS) has become an important platform for the expression of recombinant proteins and is especially useful for the production of large protein complexes such as virus-like particles (VLPs). An important application for VLPs is their use as vehicles for targeted delivery of drugs or toxins which requires the development of methods for efficient loading with the intended cargo. Our research intends to employ the BEVS for the production of VLPs for the delivery of insecticidal dsRNA molecules to targeted insect pests (as \"dsRNA-VLPs\"). A convenient strategy would be the co-expression of long dsRNAs with viral capsid proteins and their simultaneous encapsulation during VLP assembly but the capacity of the BEVS for the production of long dsRNA has not been assessed so far. In this study, the efficiency of production of long RNA hairpins targeting the <i>luciferase</i> gene (\"dsLuc\") by the <i>polyhedrin</i> promoter during baculovirus infection was evaluated. However, RNAi reporter assays could not detect significant amounts of dsLuc in Hi5 cells infected with recombinant baculovirus, even in the presence of co-expressed dsRNA-binding protein B2-GFP or the employment of the MS2-MCP system. Nevertheless, dot blot analyses using anti-dsRNA antibody revealed that baculovirus-mediated expression of B2-GFP resulted in significant increases in dsRNA levels in infected cells that may correspond to hybridized complementary viral transcripts. Using B2-GFP as a genetically encoded sensor, dsRNA foci were detected in the nuclei that partially co-localized with DAPI staining, consistent with their localization at the virogenic stroma. Co-localization experiments with the baculovirus proteins vp39, Ac93, ODV-E25 and gp64 indicated limited overlap between B2-GFP and the ring zone compartment where assembly of nucleocapsids and virions occurs. Stability experiments showed that exogenous dsRNA is resistant to degradation in extracts of non-infected and infected Hi5 cells and it is proposed that strong unwinding activity at the virogenic stroma in the infected nuclei may neutralize the annealing of complementary RNA strands and block the production of long dsRNAs. Because the strong stability of exogenous dsRNA, transfection can be explored as an alternative method for delivery of cargo for dsRNA-VLPs during their assembly in baculovirus-infected Hi5 cells.",

The spatiotemporal distribution and homeostasis of Zn<sup>2+</sup> can be monitored through photoluminescence imaging using zinc sensors. Among such biosensors, genetically encoded fluorescent sensor proteins are attractive tools owing to their subcellular localization advantage and high biocompatibility. However, the limited fluorescent properties of these proteins, such as their insufficient quantum yield and dynamic range, restrict their practical use. In this study, we developed an expression-screening-directed evolution system and used it to improve ZapCY1, a genetically encoded fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) sensor. After four rounds of directed evolution, the FRET dynamic range of the modified sensor (designated ZapTV-EH) was increased by 1.5-1.7-fold. With its enhanced signal-to-noise ratio and ability to detect a wide Zn<sup>2+</sup> concentration range, ZapTV-EH proves to be a better visualization tool for monitoring Zn<sup>2+</sup> at the subcellular level. Combined with the simplified subcloning and expression steps and sufficient mutant libraries, this directed evolution system may provide a more simple and efficient way to develop and optimize genetically encoded FRET sensors through high-throughput screening.",

        "abstract": "In Alzheimer's disease (AD), synaptic dysfunction is thought to occur many years before the onset of cognitive decline. Detecting synaptic dysfunctions at the earliest stage of AD would be desirable in both clinic and research settings. Population voltage imaging allows monitoring of synaptic depolarizations, to which calcium imaging is relatively blind. We developed an AD mouse model (APPswe/PS1dE9 background) expressing a genetically-encoded voltage indicator (GEVI) in the neocortex. GEVI was restricted to the excitatory pyramidal neurons (unlike the voltage-sensitive dyes). Expression of GEVI did not disrupt AD model formation of amyloid plaques. GEVI expression was stable in both AD model mice and Control (healthy) littermates (CTRL) over 247 days postnatal. Brain slices were stimulated in layer 2/3. From the evoked voltage waveforms, we extracted several parameters for comparison AD versus CTRL. Some parameters (e.g., temporal summation, refractoriness, and peak latency) were weak predictors, while other parameters (e.g., signal amplitude, attenuation with distance, and duration (half-width) of the evoked transients) were stronger predictors of the AD condition. Around postnatal age 150 days (P150) and especially at P200, synaptically-evoked voltage signals in brain slices were weaker in the AD groups versus the age- and sex-matched CTRL groups, suggesting an AD-mediated synaptic weakening that coincides with the accumulation of plaques. However, at the youngest ages examined, P40 and P80, the AD groups showed differentially stronger signals, suggesting \"hyperexcitability\" prior to the formation of plaques. Our results indicate bidirectional alterations in cortical physiology in AD model mice; occurring both prior (P40-80), and after (P150-200) the amyloid deposition.",

While interactors for the class I interaction, which involves binding of a SUMO-interacting motif (SIM) to a hydrophobic groove in SUMO-1 and SUMO-2/3, are widely abundant, only a couple of examples have been reported for the other two types of interactions. Class II binding is conveyed by the E67 loop region on SUMO-1. Many previous studies to identify SUMO binders using pull-down or microarray approaches did not strategize on the SUMO binding mode. Identification of SUMO binding partners is further complicated due to the typically transient and low affinity interactions with the modifier. Here we aimed to identify SUMO-1 binders selectively enriched for class II binding. Using a genetically encoded photo-crosslinker approach, we have designed SUMO-1 probes to covalently capture class II SUMO-1 interactors by strategically positioning the photo-crosslinking moiety on the SUMO-1 surface. The probes were validated using known class II and class I binding partners. We utilized the probe with p-benzoyl-phenylalanine (BzF, also termed BpF or Bpa) at the position of Gln69 to identify binding proteins from mammalian cell extracts using mass spectrometry. By comparison with results obtained with a similarly designed SUMO-1 probe to target SIM-mediated binders of the class I type, we identified 192 and 96 proteins specifically enriched by either probe, respectively. The implicated preferential class I or class II binding modes of these proteins will further contribute to unveiling the complex interplay of SUMO-1-mediated interactions.",

We show that SALSA accurately reports Notch activity in different signaling paradigms in Caenorhabditis elegans and use time-lapse imaging to test hypotheses about how stochastic elements ensure a reproducible and robust outcome in a canonical lin-12/Notch-mediated lateral signaling paradigm. SALSA should be generalizable to other experimental systems and be adaptable to increase options for bespoke \"SynNotch\" applications.",

        "abstract": "Secretion of the acrosome, a single vesicle located rostrally in the head of a mammalian sperm, through a process known as \"acrosome exocytosis\" (AE), is essential for fertilization. However, the mechanisms leading to and regulating this complex process are controversial. In particular, poor understanding of Ca2+ dynamics between sperm subcellular compartments and regulation of membrane fusion mechanisms have led to competing models of AE. Here, we developed a transgenic mouse expressing an Acrosome-targeted Sensor for Exocytosis (AcroSensE) to investigate the spatial and temporal Ca2+ dynamics in AE in live sperm. AcroSensE combines a genetically encoded Ca2+ indicator (GCaMP) fused with an mCherry indicator to spatiotemporally resolve acrosomal Ca2+ rise (ACR) and membrane fusion events, enabling real-time study of AE. We found that ACR is dependent on extracellular Ca2+ and that ACR precedes AE. In addition, we show that there are intermediate steps in ACR and that AE correlates better with the ACR rate rather than absolute Ca2+ amount. Finally, we demonstrate that ACR and membrane fusion progression kinetics and spatial patterns differ with different stimuli and that sites of initiation of ACR and sites of membrane fusion do not always correspond. These findings support a model involving functionally redundant pathways that enable a highly regulated, multistep AE in heterogeneous sperm populations, unlike the previously proposed \"acrosome reaction\" model.",

The fluctuations of lactate levels within biological tissues, in particular in the interstitial space, are crucial to assess with high spatial and temporal resolution, and this is best achieved using cellular imaging approaches. In this study, we evaluated the suitability of the lactate receptor, hydroxycarboxylic acid receptor 1 (HCAR1, formerly named GPR81), as a basis for the development of a genetically encoded fluorescent lactate biosensor. We used a biosensor strategy that was successfully applied to molecules such as dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine, based on their respective G-protein-coupled receptors. In this study, a set of intensiometric sensors was constructed and expressed in living cells. They showed selective expression at the plasma membrane and responded to physiological concentrations of lactate. However, these sensors lost the original ability of HCAR1 to selectively respond to lactate versus other related small carboxylic acid molecules. Therefore, while representing a promising building block for a lactate biosensor, HCAR1 was found to be sensitive to perturbations of its structure, affecting its ability to distinguish between related carboxylic molecules.",

However, the relationships between the redox status and ROS production during apoptosis remain poorly explored. In this study, we present an investigation on the correlations between the production of ROS, the redox ratio FAD/NAD(P)H, the proportions of the reduced nicotinamide cofactors NADH and NADPH, and caspase-3 activity in cancer cells at the level of individual cells. Two-photon excitation fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) was applied to monitor simultaneously apoptosis using the genetically encoded sensor of caspase-3, mKate2-DEVD-iRFP, and the autofluorescence of redox cofactors in colorectal cancer cells upon stimulation of apoptosis with staurosporine, cisplatin or hydrogen peroxide. We found that, irrespective of the apoptotic stimulus used, ROS accumulation correlated well with both the elevated pool of mitochondrial, enzyme-bound NADH and caspase-3 activation. Meanwhile, a shift in the contribution of bound NADH could develop independently of the apoptosis, and this was observed in the case of cisplatin. An increase in the proportion of bound NADPH was detected only in staurosporine-treated cells, this likely being associated with a high level of ROS production and their resulting detoxification. The results of the study favor the discovery of new therapeutic strategies based on manipulation of the cellular redox balance, which could help improve the anti-tumor activity of drugs and overcome apoptotic resistance.",

A plethora of synthetic switches, circuits, and even higher order networks has been implemented in different organisms, such as bacteria and mammalian cells, and facilitates the study of signaling and metabolic pathways. However, the application of such tools in plants lags behind, and thus only a few genetically encoded biosensors and switches have been engineered toward the quantitative investigation of plant signaling. Here, we present a protocol for the quantitative analysis of auxin signaling in Arabidopsis thaliana protoplasts. We implemented genetically encoded, ratiometric, degradation-based luminescent biosensors and applied them for studying auxin perception dynamics. For this, we utilized three different Aux/IAAs as sensor modules and analyzed their degradation behavior in response to auxin. Our experimental approach requires simple hardware and experimental reagents and can thus be implemented in every plant-related or cell culture laboratory. The system allows for the analysis of auxin perception and signaling aspects on various levels and can be easily expanded to other hormones, as for example strigolactones.

In this context, the unicellular intraerythrocytic parasite <i>Plasmodium</i>, the causative agent of malaria, represents a challenge, as the small size of the organism results in weak fluorescence signals that complicate precise measurements, especially for cell compartment-specific observations.

Even though a variety of genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicators have been developed to study astrocyte calcium signaling, understanding the dynamics of endoplasmic reticulum calcium signaling is greatly limited by the currently available tools. To address this, we developed an endoplasmic reticulum-targeted calcium indicator, ER-GCaMP6f, which is anchored to the cytosolic side of the organelle and measures signaling that occurs in close proximity to the endoplasmic reticulum of astrocytes. Using a combination of confocal and super-resolution microscopy techniques, we demonstrate the localization of the indicator in the endoplasmic reticulum in both cell soma and processes of astrocytes. Combining ER-GCaMP6f with total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy, we show that Ca<sup>2+</sup> fluctuations in small astrocytic processes can be detected, which are otherwise not observable with existing indicators and standard wide-field and confocal techniques. We also compared the ER-GCaMP6f indicator against currently used plasma membrane-tethered and cytosolic GCaMP6f indicators. ER-GCaMP6f identifies dynamics in calcium signaling of endoplasmic reticulum resident receptors that are missed by plasma membrane-anchored indicators. We also generated an adeno-associated virus (AAV5) and demonstrate that ER-GCaMP6f can be expressed <i>in vivo</i> and by measured calcium activity in brain slices.

We found that 25% of CA1 place fields were formed at the first arrival in the corresponding place, while the average tuning latency for all place fields in a novel environment equaled 247 s. After 24 h, when the environment was familiar to the animals, place fields formed faster, independent of retention of cognitive maps during this session. No cumulation of selectivity score was observed between these two sessions. Using dimensionality reduction, we demonstrated that the population activity of rapidly tuned CA1 place cells allowed the reconstruction of the geometry of the navigated circular maze; the distribution of reconstruction error between the mice was consistent with the distribution of the average place field selectivity score in them. Our data thus show that neuronal activity recorded with genetically encoded calcium sensors revealed fast behavior-dependent plasticity in the mouse hippocampus, resulting in the rapid formation of place fields and population activity that allowed the reconstruction of the geometry of the navigated maze.",

As the only transporters known to facilitate the cellular release of sugars in plants, SWEETs play critical roles in the allocation of sugars from photosynthetic leaves to storage tissues in seeds, fruits, and tubers. Here, we report the design and use of genetically encoded biosensors to measure the activity of SWEETs. We created a SweetTrac1 sensor by inserting a circularly permutated green fluorescent protein into the <i>Arabidopsis</i> SWEET1, resulting in a chimera that translates substrate binding during the transport cycle into detectable changes in fluorescence intensity. We demonstrate that a combination of cell sorting and bioinformatics can accelerate the design of biosensors and formulate a mass action kinetics model to correlate the fluorescence response of SweetTrac1 with the transport of glucose. Our analysis suggests that SWEETs are low-affinity, symmetric transporters that can rapidly equilibrate intra- and extracellular concentrations of sugars. This approach can be extended to SWEET homologs and other transporters.",

        "abstract": "Cells can be affected by several causes of osmotic stress, by which they are forced to adapt. An essential aspect of adaptation is ion regulation, and many insights into such complex processes can be obtained through measurement of the plasma membrane potential (PMP) of cells during stress. We recently established genetically encoded voltage indicator proteins that could be utilized to report the yeast PMP change in real time. In this work, we employed this method to monitor the early change in the PMP of yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae with intact cell wall, immediately following hyperosmotic up-shock due to various stress agents. The results pointed to differential effects of NaCl, sorbitol and polyethylene glycol (PEG) 6000. Yeast PMP was more responsive toward PEG 6000 than NaCl and sorbitol at comparable osmotic pressure, and PEG 6000 stimulated the largest response magnitude, followed by sorbitol and NaCl, respectively. After prolonged treatment, PEG 6000 also instigated distinct cell morphology from NaCl and sorbitol. Accordingly, this study presents new evidence supporting multiple pathways underlying yeast adaptation to varying hyperosmotic conditions, enabled through the optical physiology approach. Our findings promote better understanding of the yeast cellular response to hyperosmotic stress, with tenable relevance to the physiologically related plant cells.",

RNAP2 has a long heptapeptide repeat (Tyr1-Ser2-Pro3-Thr4-Ser5-Pro6-Ser7), and Ser2 is phosphorylated on an elongation form. To detect RNAP2 Ser2 phosphorylation (RNAP2 Ser2ph) in living cells, we developed a genetically encoded modification-specific intracellular antibody (mintbody) probe. The RNAP2 Ser2ph-mintbody exhibited numerous foci, possibly representing transcription \"factories,\" and foci were diminished during mitosis and in a Ser2 kinase inhibitor. An in vitro binding assay using phosphopeptides confirmed the mintbody's specificity. RNAP2 Ser2ph-mintbody foci were colocalized with proteins associated with elongating RNAP2 compared with factors involved in the initiation. These results support the view that mintbody localization represents the sites of RNAP2 Ser2ph in living cells. RNAP2 Ser2ph-mintbody foci showed constrained diffusional motion like chromatin, but they were more mobile than DNA replication domains and p300-enriched foci, suggesting that the elongating RNAP2 complexes are separated from more confined chromatin domains.",

Herbivory, for instance, appears to trigger local apoplasmic glutamate accumulation, systemic electrical signals, and calcium waves that travel to report insect damage to neighboring leaves and initiate defense. To monitor extra- and intracellular glutamate concentrations in plants, we generated Arabidopsis lines expressing genetically encoded fluorescent glutamate sensors. In contrast to cytosolically localized sensors, extracellularly displayed variants inhibited plant growth and proper development. Phenotypic analyses of high-affinity display sensor lines revealed that root meristem development, particularly the quiescent center, number of lateral roots, vegetative growth, and floral architecture were impacted. Notably, the severity of the phenotypes was positively correlated with the affinity of the display sensors, intimating that their ability to sequester glutamate at the surface of the plasma membrane was responsible for the defects. Root growth defects were suppressed by supplementing culture media with low levels of glutamate. Together, the data indicate that sequestration of glutamate at the cell surface either disrupts the supply of glutamate to meristematic cells and/or impairs localized glutamatergic signaling important for developmental processes.",

By monitoring the abundance of a truncated and fluorescently labeled SUPPRESSOR OF MAX2 1-LIKE 6 (SMXL6) protein, a proteolytic target of the SL signaling machinery, we show that all cell types investigated have the capacity to respond to changes in SL levels but with very different dynamics.

We also show that other hormones leave Strigo-D2 activity unchanged, indicating that initial SL signaling steps work in isolation from other hormonal signaling pathways.

Although genetically encoded fluorescent biosensors have been developed to detect DA, their poor selectivity prevents distinguishing DA from NE. Here, we report the development of a red fluorescent genetically encoded GPCR (G protein-coupled receptor)-activation reporter for DA termed 'R-GenGAR-DA'. More specifically, a circular permutated red fluorescent protein (cpmApple) was replaced by the third intracellular loop of human DA receptor D1 (DRD1) followed by the screening of mutants within the linkers between DRD1 and cpmApple.

R-GenGAR-DA1.2 demonstrated a reasonable dynamic range (ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> = - 43%), DA affinity (EC<sub>50</sub> = 0.92 µM) and high selectivity for DA over NE (66-fold) in HeLa cells. Taking advantage of the high selectivity of R-GenGAR-DA1.2, we monitored DA in presence of NE using dual-color fluorescence live imaging, combined with the green-NE biosensor GRAB<sub>NE1m</sub>, which has high selectivity for NE over DA (> 350-fold) in HeLa cells and hippocampal neurons grown from primary culture. Thus, this is a first step toward the multiplex imaging of these neurotransmitters in, for example, freely moving animals, which will provide new opportunities to advance our understanding of the high spatiotemporal dynamics of DA and NE in normal and abnormal brain function.",

Enzyme discovery and optimization which is frequently needed to improve biocatalytic performance rely on high-throughput methods for activity determination. These methods should ideally be generic and applicable to entire enzyme families. Hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) is a product of several biocatalytic oxidations and its formation can serve as a proxy for oxidative activity. We designed a genetically encoded sensor for activity measurement of oxidative biocatalysts <i>via</i> the amount of intracellularly-formed H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. A key component of the sensor is an H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-sensitive transcriptional regulator, OxyR, which is used to control the expression levels of fluorescent proteins. We employed the OxyR sensor to monitor the oxidation of glycerol to glyceraldehyde and of toluene to <i>o</i>-cresol catalysed by recombinant <i>E. coli</i> expressing an alcohol oxidase and a P450 monooxygenase, respectively. In case of the P450 BM3-catalysed reaction, we additionally monitored <i>o</i>-cresol formation <i>via</i> a second genetically encoded sensor based on the phenol-sensitive transcriptional activator, DmpR, and an orthogonal fluorescent reporter protein.

While fluorescent reporters have been widely used, photostability and phototoxicity have hindered their use in long-term experiments. Bioluminescence overcomes some of these challenges but requires the addition of an exogenous luciferin limiting its use. Using a modular approach, Autonomous Molecular BioluminEscent Reporter (AMBER), an indicator of membrane potential is engineered. Unlike other bioluminescent systems, AMBER is a voltage-gated luciferase coupling the functionalities of the Ciona voltage-sensing domain (VSD) and bacterial luciferase, luxAB. When co-expressed with the luciferin-producing genes, AMBER reversibly switches the bioluminescent intensity as a function of membrane potential. Using biophysical and biochemical methods, it is shown that AMBER switches its enzymatic activity from an OFF to an ON state as a function of the membrane potential. Upon depolarization, AMBER switches from a low to a high enzymatic activity state, showing a several-fold increase in the bioluminescence output (ΔL/L). AMBER in the pharyngeal muscles and mechanosensory touch neurons of Caenorhabditis elegans is expressed. Using the compressed sensing approach, the electropharingeogram of the C. elegans pharynx is reconstructed, validating the sensor in vivo.

UDP-GlcNAc is thus a central metabolite connecting nutrition, metabolism, signaling, and disease. There is a great interest in monitoring UDP-GlcNAc in biological systems.

Although UGAcS responds to UDP-GlcNAc quite selectively among various nucleotide sugars, UDP and uridine triphosphate (UTP) interfere with the response. We thus developed another biosensor named UXPS, which is responsive to UDP and UTP but not UDP-GlcNAc. We demonstrated the use of the biosensors to follow UDP-GlcNAc levels in cultured mammalian cells perturbed with nutritional changes, pharmacological inhibition, and knockdown or overexpression of key enzymes in the UDP-GlcNAc synthesis pathway.

During LLPS, proteins and nucleotides are extremely condensed, resulting in changes in their conformation and biological functions. Disturbed LLPS homeostasis in MLOs is thought to associate with fatal diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Therefore, it is important to detect changes in the degree of crowding in MLOs. However, it has not been investigated well due to the lack of an appropriate method. To address this, we developed a genetically encoded macromolecular crowding sensor CRONOS (crowding sensor with mNeonGreen and mScarlet-I) that senses the degree of macromolecular crowding in MLOs using a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) system. CRONOS is a bright biosensor with a wide dynamic range and successfully detects changes in the macromolecular volume fraction in solution. By fusing to the scaffold protein of each MLO, we delivered CRONOS to MLO of interest and detected previously undescribed differences in the degree of crowding in each MLO. CRONOS also detected changes in the degree of macromolecular crowding in nucleolus induced by environmental stress or inhibition of transcription. These findings suggest that CRONOS can be a useful tool for the determination of molecular crowding and detection of pathological changes in MLOs in live cells.",

Here, a genetically encoded protein thermometer (human enhanced gene activation thermometer; HEAT) is designed that can trigger transgene expression in the range of 37-40 °C by linking a mutant coiled-coil temperature-responsive protein sensor to a synthetic transcription factor. To validate the construct, a HEAT-transgenic monoclonal human cell line, FeverSense, is generated and it is confirmed that it works as a fever sensor that can temperature- and exposure-time-dependently trigger reporter gene expression in vitro and in vivo. For translational proof of concept, microencapsulated designer cells stably expressing a HEAT-controlled insulin production cassette in a mouse model of type-1 diabetes are subcutaneously implanted and topical heating patches are used to apply heat corresponding to a warm sensation in humans. Insulin release is induced, restoring normoglycemia.

Nonetheless, the temporality of the events triggered and the role of different ROS sources remain unclear. Isolated islets from C57BL/6J wild-type (WT), NOX1 KO and NOX2 KO mice were exposed to a PIC combination. We show that cytokines increase O<sub>2</sub><sup>•-</sup> production after 2 h in WT and NOX1 KO but not in NOX2 KO islets. Using transgenic mice constitutively expressing a genetically encoded compartment specific H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> sensor, we show, for the first time, a transient increase of cytosolic/nuclear H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in islet cells between 4 and 5 h during cytokine exposure. The H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> increase coincides with the intracellular NAD(P)H decrease and is absent in NOX2 KO islets. NOX2 KO confers better glucose tolerance and protects against cytokine-induced islet secretory dysfunction and death.

Gene perturbation screens could provide a powerful approach to probe the molecular mechanisms of protein trafficking, but only if protein localization or mislocalization can be tied to a simple and robust phenotype for cell selection, such as cell proliferation or fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). To empower the study of protein trafficking processes with gene perturbation, we developed a genetically encoded molecular tool named HiLITR (High-throughput Localization Indicator with Transcriptional Readout). HiLITR converts protein colocalization into proteolytic release of a membrane-anchored transcription factor, which drives the expression of a chosen reporter gene. Using HiLITR in combination with FACS-based CRISPRi screening in human cell lines, we identified genes that influence the trafficking of mitochondrial and ER tail-anchored proteins. We show that loss of the SUMO E1 component SAE1 results in mislocalization and destabilization of many mitochondrial tail-anchored proteins. We also demonstrate a distinct regulatory role for EMC10 in the ER membrane complex, opposing the transmembrane-domain insertion activity of the complex. Through transcriptional integration of complex cellular functions, HiLITR expands the scope of biological processes that can be studied by genetic perturbation screening technologies.",

However, GETIs have suffered from poor temperature sensitivity, which may not be sufficient to resolve small heat production from a biological process. Here, we develop a highly-sensitive GETI, denoted as ELP-TEMP, comprised of a temperature-responsive elastin-like polypeptide (ELP) fused with a cyan fluorescent protein (FP), mTurquoise2 (mT), and a yellow FP, mVenus (mV), as the donor and acceptor, respectively, of Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET). At elevated temperatures, the ELP moiety in ELP-TEMP undergoes a phase transition leading to an increase in the FRET efficiency. In HeLa cells, ELP-TEMP responded to the temperature from 33 to 40 °C with a maximum temperature sensitivity of 45.1 ± 8.1%/°C, which was the highest ever temperature sensitivity among hitherto-developed fluorescent nanothermometers. Although ELP-TEMP showed sensitivity not only to temperature but also to macromolecular crowding and self-concentration, we were able to correct the output of ELP-TEMP to achieve accurate temperature measurements at a subcellular resolution. We successfully applied ELP-TEMP to accurately measure temperature changes in cells induced by a local heat spot, even if the temperature difference was as small as < 1 °C, and to visualize heat production from stimulated Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx in live HeLa cells induced by a chemical stimulation. Furthermore, we investigated temperatures in the nucleus and cytoplasm of live HeLa cells and found that their temperatures were almost the same within the temperature resolution of our measurement.

        "abstract": "Acetylation of lysine in the histone H4 N-terminal is one of the most significant epigenetic modifications in cells. Aberrant changes involving lysine acetylation modification are commonly reported in multiple types of cancers. Currently, whether it is for in vivo or in vitro, there are limited approaches for the detection of H4 lysine acetylation levels. In particular, the main problems are the high cost and the cumbersome detection process, such as for radioactive <sup>14</sup>C isotope detection. Therefore, there is an important need to develop a simple, fast, and low-cost means of detection. In this study, we reported the development of a gene-coding protein sensor. This protein sensor was designed based on the mechanism of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). The four kinds of sensors, varying from substrate and linker length, were evaluated, with ~20% increases in response efficiency. Next, sensors with different lysine mutation sites in the substrate sequence or mutation of key amino acids in the binding domain were also analyzed to determine site specificity. We found single-site lysine mutant could not cause a significant decrease in response efficiency. Furthermore, addition of MG149, a histone acetyltransferase inhibitor, resulted in a decrease in the ratio change value. Moreover, histone deacetylase1 HDAC1 was also found to reduce the ratio change values when added to reaction system. Finally, the optimized sensor was applied to living cells and established to provide a sensitive response with overexpression and knockdown of MOF (males absent on the first). These results indicated that the sensor can be used for screening chemical drugs regulating H4 N-terminal lysine acetylation level in vitro, as well as monitoring dynamic changes of lysine acetylation levels in living cells.",

For three resulting sensor constructs the corresponding glucose induced conformational changes were measured by small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and compared to recently published single molecule FRET results (Höfig et al., <i>ACS Sensors</i>, 2018). For one construct which exhibits a high change in energy transfer and a large change of the radius of gyration upon ligand binding, we performed coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations for the ligand-free and the ligand-bound state. Our analysis indicates that a carefully designed attachment of the donor FP is crucial for the proper transfer of the glucose induced conformational change of the glucose binding protein into a well pronounced FRET signal change as measured in this sensor construct. Since the other FP (acceptor) does not experience such a glucose induced alteration, it becomes apparent that only one of the FPs needs to have a well-adjusted attachment to the glucose binding protein.",

Commercially, it is used in the production of antiviral drugs, infant milk formulas, cosmetics, dietary supplements, and pharmaceutical products. Because of the rapidly increasing demand, metabolic engineering approach has attracted increasing attention for NeuAc biosynthesis. However, knowledge of metabolite flux in biosynthetic pathways is one of the major challenges in the practice of metabolic engineering. So, an understanding of the flux of NeuAc is needed to determine its cellular level at real time. The analysis of the flux can only be performed using a tool that has the capacity to measure metabolite level in cells without affecting other metabolic processes. A Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET)-based genetically-encoded nanosensor has been generated in this study to monitor the level of NeuAc in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. Sialic acid periplasmic binding protein (SiaP) from <i>Haemophilus influenzae</i> was exploited as a sensory element for the generation of nanosensor. The enhanced cyan fluorescent protein (ECFP) and Venus were used as Fluroscence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) pair. The nanosensor, which was termed fluorescent indicator protein for sialic acid (FLIP-SA), was successfully transformed into, and expressed in <i>Escherichia coli</i> BL21 (DE3) cells. The expressed protein of the nanosensor was isolated and purified. The purified nanosensor protein was characterized to assess the affinity, specificity, and stability in the pH range. The developed nanosensor exhibited FRET change after addition to NeuAc. The developed nanosensor was highly specific, exhibited pH stability, and detected NeuAc levels in the nanomolar to milimolar range. FLIP-SA was successfully introduced in bacterial and yeast cells and reported the real-time intracellular levels of NeuAc non-invasively. The FLIP-SA is an excellent tool for the metabolic flux analysis of the NeuAc biosynthetic pathway and, thus, may help unravel the regulatory mechanism of the metabolic pathway of NeuAc. Furthermore, FLIP-SA can be used for the high-throughput screening of <i>E. coli</i> mutant libraries for varied NeuAc production levels.",

        "abstract": "Melanocytes are specialized cells that produce melanin pigments responsible for skin, hair, and eye pigmentation. The synthesis and storage of melanin occurs in unique lysosome-related organelles called melanosomes, which regulate melanin production via complex regulatory mechanisms. Maintenance of the melanosome luminal ionic environment and pH is crucial for proper function of the main melanogenic enzymes. Defects in genes encoding pH-regulating melanosomal proteins result in oculocutaneous albinism, which is characterized by hypopigmentation, impaired vision, and increased susceptibility to skin and eye cancers. We recently uncovered several ion channels and transporters that modulate melanin synthesis by acidifying or neutralizing the luminal pH of melanosomes. However, our understanding of how melanosomes and other related organelles maintain their luminal pH is far from complete. The study of melanosome pH regulation requires robust imaging and quantification tools. Despite recent advances in the development of such methods, many limitations remain, particularly for quantitative analysis of individual organelle pH. In this chapter, we will provide an overview of the available methods used for melanosome pH determination, including their advantages, limitations, and challenges. To address the critical, unmet need for reliable melanosome pH quantification tools, we engineered a novel genetically encoded, ratiometric pH sensor for melanosomes that we named RpHiMEL. Here, we describe the design and optimization of RpHiMEL, and provide a pH quantification method for individual melanosomes in live cells.

        "abstract": "In the last decades, membrane contact sites (MCSs) have been the object of intense investigation in different fields of cell physiology and pathology and their importance for the correct functioning of the cell is now widely recognized. MCS between any known intercellular organelles, including endoplasmic reticulum (ER), mitochondria, Golgi, endosomes, peroxisomes, lysosomes, lipid droplets, and the plasma membrane (PM), have been largely documented and in some cases the molecules responsible for the tethering also identified. They represent specific membrane hubs where a tightly coordinated exchange of ions, lipids, nutrients, and factors required to maintain proper cellular homeostasis takes place. Their delicate, dynamic, and sometimes elusive nature prevented and/or delayed the development of tools to easily image interorganelle proximity under physiological conditions and in living organisms. Nowadays, this aspect received great momentum due to the finding that MCSs' dysregulation is involved in several pathological conditions. We have recently developed modular, split-GFP-based contact site sensors (SPLICS) engineered to fluoresce when homo- and heterotypic juxtapositions between ER and mitochondria occur over a range of specific distances. Here we describe in detail, by highlighting strengths and weaknesses, the use and the application of these novel genetically encoded SPLICS sensors and how to properly quantify short- and long-range ER-mitochondria interactions.",

However, to achieve this, there remains a big challenge in how to efficiently label ER with advanced fluorophores.

This hybrid labeling system integrating chemical probes with genetically encoded techniques enables molecular position reconstructions of ER morphologies through direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM) imaging.

Ca<sup>2+</sup> is a versatile intracellular messenger involved in sensing a wide variety of stresses and regulating the subsequent cellular responses. So far, our understanding for calcium signaling was mostly obtained from ex vivo tissues and cultured cell lines, and the in vivo spatiotemporal dynamics of stress-triggered calcium signaling in a vertebrate remains to be characterized. Here, we describe the generation and characterization of a transgenic zebrafish line with ubiquitous expression of GCaMP6s, a genetically encoded calcium indicator (GECI). We developed a method to investigate the spatiotemporal patterns of Ca<sup>2+</sup> events induced by heat stress. Exposure to heat stress elicited immediate and transient calcium signaling in developing zebrafish. Cells extensively distributed in the integument of the head and body trunk were the first batch of responders and different cell populations demonstrated distinct response patterns upon heat stress. Activity of the heat stress-induced calcium signaling peaked at 30 s and swiftly decreased to near the basal level at 120 s after the beginning of exposure. Inhibition of the heat-induced calcium signaling by LaCl<sub>3</sub> and capsazepine and treatment with the inhibitors for CaMKII (Ca²<sup>2</sup>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II) and HSF1 (Heat shock factor 1) all significantly depressed the enhanced heat shock response (HSR).

However, a major challenge in the field is that the crosstalk between many cellular signaling pathways use the same signaling endogenous molecules that can result in undesired activation. To overcome this problem, we utilized a specific promoter that can activate genes with a natural, non-toxic ligand at a highly-induced transcription level with low background or undesirable off-target expression.

As a result of the depletion of its natural sources, researchers have tried to employ metabolic engineering to enhance α-tocopherol production to meet the human consumption demand. However, the metabolic engineering approach relies on the metabolic flux of a metabolite in its biosynthetic pathway. Analysis of the metabolic flux of a metabolite needs a method that can monitor the α-tocopherol level in living cells. This study was undertaken to construct a FRET (fluorescence resonance energy transfer)-based nanosensor for monitoring the α-tocopherol flux in prokaryotic and eukaryotic living cells. The human α-TTP was sandwiched between a pair of FRET fluorophores to construct the nanosensor, which was denoted as FLIP-α (the fluorescence indicator for α-tocopherol). FLIP-α showed excellence in monitoring the α-tocopherol flux with high specificity. The sensor was examined for its pH stability for physiological applications, where it shows no pH hindrance to its activity. The calculated affinity of this nanosensor was 100 μM. It monitored the real-time flux of α-tocopherol in bacterial and yeast cells, proving its biocompatibility in monitoring the α-tocopherol dynamics in living cells. Being noninvasive, FLIP-α provides high temporal and spatial resolutions, which holds an indispensable significance in bioimaging metabolic pathways that are highly compartmentalized.",

Its dynamic redistribution has an essential role in almost every aspect of plant life, ranging from cell shape and division to organogenesis and responses to light and gravity<sup>1,2</sup>. So far, it has not been possible to directly determine the spatial and temporal distribution of auxin at a cellular resolution. Instead it is inferred from the visualization of irreversible processes that involve the endogenous auxin-response machinery<sup>3-7</sup>; however, such a system cannot detect transient changes. Here we report a genetically encoded biosensor for the quantitative in vivo visualization of auxin distribution. The sensor is based on the Escherichia coli tryptophan repressor<sup>8</sup>, the binding pocket of which is engineered to be specific to auxin. Coupling of the auxin-binding moiety with selected fluorescent proteins enables the use of a fluorescence resonance energy transfer signal as a readout. Unlike previous systems, this sensor enables direct monitoring of the rapid uptake and clearance of auxin by individual cells and within cell compartments in planta. By responding to the graded spatial distribution along the root axis and its perturbation by transport inhibitors-as well as the rapid and reversible redistribution of endogenous auxin in response to changes in gravity vectors-our sensor enables real-time monitoring of auxin concentrations at a (sub)cellular resolution and their spatial and temporal changes during the lifespan of a plant.",

        "abstract": "Biomolecular assemblies govern the physiology of cells. Their function often depends on the changes in molecular arrangements of constituents, both in the positions and orientations. While recent advancements of fluorescence microscopy including super-resolution microscopy have enabled us to determine the positions of fluorophores with unprecedented accuracy, monitoring the orientation of fluorescently labeled molecules within living cells in real time is challenging. Fluorescence polarization microscopy (FPM) reports the orientation of emission dipoles and is therefore a promising solution. For imaging with FPM, target proteins need labeling with fluorescent probes in a sterically constrained manner, but because of difficulties in the rational three-dimensional design of protein connection, a universal method for constrained tagging with fluorophore was not available. Here, we report POLArIS, a genetically encoded and versatile probe for molecular orientation imaging. Instead of using a direct tagging approach, we used a recombinant binder connected to a fluorescent protein in a sterically constrained manner that can target specific biomolecules of interest by combining with phage display screening. As an initial test case, we developed POLArIS<sup>act</sup>, which specifically binds to F-actin in living cells. We confirmed that the orientation of F-actin can be monitored by observing cells expressing POLArIS<sup>act</sup> with FPM. In living starfish early embryos expressing POLArIS<sup>act</sup>, we found actin filaments radially extending from centrosomes in association with microtubule asters during mitosis. By taking advantage of the genetically encoded nature, POLArIS can be used in a variety of living specimens, including whole bodies of developing embryos and animals, and also be expressed in a cell type/tissue specific manner.",

To advance the understanding of MOR's roles in pain modulation, there is a need for high-throughput screening methods of opioids in vitro and high-resolution mapping of opioids in the brain. To fill this need, we designed and characterized a genetically encoded fluorescent reporter, called Single-chain Protein-based Opioid Transmission Indicator Tool for MOR (M-SPOTIT). M-SPOTIT represents a new and unique mechanism for fluorescent reporter design and can detect MOR activation, leaving a persistent green fluorescence mark for image analysis. M-SPOTIT showed an opioid-dependent signal to noise ratio (S/N) up to 12.5 and was able to detect as fast as a 30-second opioid exposure in HEK293T cell culture. Additionally, it showed an opioid-dependent S/N up to 4.6 in neuronal culture and detected fentanyl with an EC<sub>50</sub> of 15 nM. M-SPOTIT will potentially be useful for high-throughput detection of opioids in cell cultures and cellular-resolution detection of opioids in vivo.

Among the different ROS, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is best characterized with respect to roles in cellular signaling. H2O2 has been implicated during the development in several species. For example, a transient increase in H2O2 has been detected in zebrafish embryos during the first days following fertilization. Furthermore, depleting an important cellular H2O2 source, NADPH oxidase (NOX), impairs nervous system development such as the differentiation, axonal growth, and guidance of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) both in vivo and in vitro. Here, we describe a method for imaging intracellular H2O2 levels in cultured zebrafish neurons and whole larvae during development using the genetically encoded H2O2-specific biosensor, roGFP2-Orp1. This probe can be transiently or stably expressed in zebrafish larvae. Furthermore, the ratiometric readout diminishes the probability of detecting artifacts due to differential gene expression or volume effects. First, we demonstrate how to isolate and culture RGCs derived from zebrafish embryos that transiently express roGFP2-Orp1. Then, we use whole larvae to monitor H2O2 levels at the tissue level. The sensor has been validated by the addition of H2O2. Additionally, this methodology could be used to measure H2O2 levels in specific cell types and tissues by generating transgenic animals with tissue-specific biosensor expression. As zebrafish facilitate genetic and developmental manipulations, the approach demonstrated here could serve as a pipeline to test the role of H2O2 during neuronal and general embryonic development in vertebrates.",

In the present study, we developed a multifunctional genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> probe capable of simultaneously measuring cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> in real time. Using this novel probe, we determined and compared mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity and the coupling with cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics in hiPSC-CMs and ACMs. Our data showed that while ACMs displayed a highly coordinated beat-by-beat response in mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> in sync with cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup>, hiPSC-CMs showed high cell-wide variability in mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity that is poorly coordinated with cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup>.

Finally, we showed that knockdown of mitofusin-2 (Mfn2), a protein tethering mitochondria and SR, led to reduced cytosolic-mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> coupling in ACMs, albeit to a lesser degree compared to hiPSC-CMs, suggesting that Mfn2 is a potential engineering target for improving mitochondrial-cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> coupling in hiPSC-CMs. Physiological relevance: The present study will advance our understanding of the role of mitochondria in Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling and cycling in CMs, and guide the development of hiPSC-CMs for healing injured hearts.",

Herein, we investigated the fluorescence depolarization dynamics of recently developed ionic strength biosensors (mCerulean3-linker-mCitrine) in Hofmeister salt (KCl, NaCl, NaI, and Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>) solutions. The mCerulean3-mCitrine acts as a Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) pair, tethered together by two oppositely charged α-helices in the linker region. We developed a time-resolved fluorescence depolarization anisotropy approach for FRET analyses, in which the donor (mCerulean3) is excited by 425-nm laser pulses, followed by fluorescence depolarization analysis of the acceptor (mCitrine) in KE (lysine-glutamate), arginine-aspartate, and arginine-glutamate ionic strength sensors with variable amino acid sequences. Similar experiments were carried out on the cleaved sensors as well as an E6G2 construct, which has neutral α-helices in the linker region, as a control. Our results show distinct dynamics of the intact and cleaved sensors. Importantly, the FRET efficiency decreases and the donor-acceptor distance increases as the environmental ionic strength increases. Our chemical equilibrium analyses of the collapsed-to-stretched conformational state transition of KE reveal that the corresponding equilibrium constant and standard Gibbs free energy changes are ionic strength dependent. We also tested the existing theoretical models for FRET analyses using steady-state anisotropy, which reveal that the angle between the dipole moments of the donor and acceptor in the KE sensor are sensitive to the ionic strength. These results help establish the time-resolved depolarization dynamics of these genetically encoded donor-acceptor pairs as a quantitative means for FRET analysis, which complement traditional methods such as time-resolved fluorescence for future in vivo studies.",

To address this, we combined an avidity-based strategy with in silico approaches to design sensors for specifically ubiquitinated nucleosomes. By linking Ub-binding domains to nucleosome-binding peptides, we engineered proteins that target H2AK13/15Ub and H2BK120Ub with Kd values from 10-8 to 10-6 M; when fused to fluorescent proteins, they work as PTM sensors in cells. The H2AK13/15Ub-specific sensor, employed to monitor signaling from endogenous DNA damage through the cell cycle, identified and differentiated roles for 53BP1 and BARD1 as mediators of this histone PTM.",

        "abstract": "The phase of the cell cycle determines numerous aspects of cancer cell behaviour including invasiveness, ability to migrate and responsiveness to cytotoxic drugs. To non-invasively monitor progression of cell cycle in vivo, a family of genetically encoded fluorescent indicators, FUCCI (fluorescent ubiquitination-based cell cycle indicator), has been developed. Existing versions of FUCCI are based on fluorescent proteins of two or more different colors fused to cell-cycle-dependent degradation motifs. Thus, FUCCI-expressing cells emit light of different colors in different phases providing a robust way to monitor cell cycle progression by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry but limiting the possibility to simultaneously visualize other markers. To overcome this limitation, we developed a single-color variant of FUCCI, called FUCCI-Red, which utilizes two red fluorescent proteins with distinct fluorescence lifetimes, mCherry and mKate2. Similarly to FUCCI, these proteins carry cell cycle-dependent degradation motifs to resolve G1 and S/G2/M phases. We showed utility of FUCCI-Red by visualizing cell cycle progression of cancer cells in 2D and 3D cultures and monitoring development of tumors in vivo by confocal and fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM). Single-channel registration and red-shifted spectra make FUCCI-Red sensor a promising instrument for multiparameter in vivo imaging applications, which was demonstrated by simultaneous detection of cellular metabolic state using endogenous fluorescence in the blue range.",

Neurotransmitters are packaged into vesicles by specific vesicular transporters.

We developed a genetically encoded probe to identify glutamatergic synaptic vesicles at the levels of both light and electron microscopy (EM) by fusing the mini singlet oxygen generator (miniSOG) probe to an intralumenal loop of the vesicular glutamate transporter-2. We then used a 3D imaging method, serial block-face scanning EM, combined with a deep learning approach for automatic segmentation of labeled synaptic vesicles to assess the subcellular distribution of transporter-defined vesicles at nanometer scale.

By fusing a nuclear localization signal to jGCaMP7f, we achieved highly efficient nuclear-specific targeting. Comparing the jGCaMP7f-NLS probe with the previous GCaMP6f-NLS calcium sensor showed clearly that jGCaMP7f-NLS is more sensitive and reverses significantly quicker thereby reflecting rapid nuclear calcium transients in a closely physiological manner. We further confirm that nuclear calcium transients precede nuclear actin polymerization by several seconds. Our data show that calcium-triggered nuclear actin assembly in fibroblasts is independent of the actin nucleating Arp2/3 complex.

This genetically encoded sensor is designed by expressing a splittable fusion of the internal reference and sensor module under a single promoter. This design strategy allows synchronous expression of the two modules with negligible interference. Live cell imaging studies reveal that the genetically encoded ratiometric RNA sensor responds specifically to mir-224. Moreover, the sensor-to-Mango fluorescence ratios are linearly correlated with the concentrations of mir-224, confirming their capability of determining mir-224 concentrations in living cells. Our genetically encoded light-up RNA sensor also enables ratiometric imaging of mir-224 in different cell lines.

In cultured mouse astrocytes, the stimulatory effect developed within seconds, engaged both the influx and efflux modes of the transporter, and was detected even at 1 mM incremental K<sup>+</sup> .

While C. albicans is a heme prototroph, we show here that it can also efficiently utilise external heme as a cellular heme source. Using genetically encoded ratiometric fluorescent heme sensors, we show that heme extracted from haemoglobin and free hemin enter the cells with different kinetics. Heme supplied as haemoglobin is taken up via the Common in Fungal Extracellular Membrane (CFEM) hemophore cascade, and reaches the cytoplasm over several hours, whereas entry of free hemin via CFEM-dependent and independent pathways is much faster, less than an hour. To prevent an influx of extracellular heme from reaching toxic levels in the cytoplasm, the cells deploy Hmx1, a heme oxygenase. Hmx1 was previously suggested to be involved in utilisation of haemoglobin and hemin as iron sources, but we find that it is primarily required to prevent heme toxicity. Taken together, the combination of novel heme sensors with genetic analysis revealed new details of the fungal mechanisms of heme import and homeostasis, necessary to balance the uses of heme as essential cofactor and potential iron source against its toxicity.",

In this study, we developed red GECI, called FRCaMP, using calmodulin (CaM) from <i>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</i> fungus as a calcium binding domain. Compared to the R-GECO1 indicator in vitro, the purified protein FRCaMP had similar spectral characteristics, brightness, and pH stability but a 1.3-fold lower ΔF/F calcium response and 2.6-fold tighter calcium affinity with K<sub>d</sub> of 441 nM and 2.4-6.6-fold lower photostability. In the cytosol of cultured HeLa cells, FRCaMP visualized calcium transients with a ΔF/F dynamic range of 5.6, which was similar to that of R-GECO1. FRCaMP robustly visualized the spontaneous activity of neuronal cultures and had a similar ΔF/F dynamic range of 1.7 but 2.1-fold faster decay kinetics vs. NCaMP7. On electrically stimulated cultured neurons, FRCaMP demonstrated 1.8-fold faster decay kinetics and 1.7-fold lower ΔF/F values per one action potential of 0.23 compared to the NCaMP7 indicator. The fungus-originating CaM of the FRCaMP indicator version with a deleted M13-like peptide did not interact with the cytosolic environment of the HeLa cells in contrast to the metazoa-originating CaM of the similarly truncated version of the GCaMP6s indicator with a deleted M13-like peptide. Finally, we generated a split version of the FRCaMP indicator, which allowed the simultaneous detection of calcium transients and the heterodimerization of bJun/bFos interacting proteins in the nuclei of HeLa cells with a ΔF/F dynamic range of 9.4 and a contrast of 2.3-3.5, respectively.",

In this study, we performed a systematic comparison of five different vesicular proteins to target the fluorescent protein mCherry and a Zn<sup>2+</sup> Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) sensor to secretory vesicles. We found that motifs derived from vesicular cargo proteins, including chromogranin A (CgA), target vesicular puncta with greater efficacy than transmembrane proteins.

        "abstract": "Oxygen levels in plant tissues may vary, depending on metabolism, diffusion barriers, and environmental availability. Current techniques to assess the oxic status of plant cells rely primarily on invasive microoptodes or Clark-type electrodes, which are not optimally suited for experiments that require high spatial and temporal resolution. In this case, a genetically encoded oxygen biosensor is required instead. This article reports the design, test, and optimization of a hypoxia-signaling reporter, based on five-time repeated hypoxia-responsive promoter elements (HRPE) driving the expression of different reporter proteins. Specifically, this study aimed to improve its performance as a reporter of hypoxic conditions by testing the effect of different untranslated regions (UTRs) at the 5' end of the reporter coding sequence. Next, we characterized an optimized version of the <i>HRPE</i> promoter (<i>HRPE-Ω</i>) in terms of hypoxia sensitivity and time responsiveness. We also observed that severe oxygen deficiency counteracted the reporter activity due to inhibition of GFP maturation, which requires molecular oxygen. To overcome this limitation, we therefore employed an oxygen-independent UnaG fluorescent protein-coupled to an O<sub>2</sub>-dependent mCherry fluorophore under the control of the optimized <i>HRPE-Ω</i> promoter. Remarkably, this sensor, provided a different mCherry/UnaG ratiometric output depending on the externally imposed oxygen concentration, providing a solution to distinguish between different degrees of tissue hypoxia. Moreover, a ubiquitously expressed UnaG-mCherry fusion could be used to image oxygen concentrations directly, albeit at a narrow range. The luminescent and fluorescent hypoxia-reporters described here can readily be used to conduct studies that involve anaerobiosis in plants.",

The H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> also acts as a central signaling molecule and regulates numerous pathways in living cells. To better understand the generation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in environmental responses and its role in cellular signaling, there is a need to study the flux of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> at high spatio-temporal resolution in a real-time fashion. Herein, we developed a genetically encoded Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET)-based nanosensor (FLIP-H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) by sandwiching the regulatory domain (RD) of OxyR between two fluorescent moieties, namely ECFP and mVenus. This nanosensor was pH stable, highly selective to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, and showed insensitivity to other oxidants like superoxide anions, nitric oxide, and peroxynitrite. The FLIP-H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> demonstrated a broad dynamic range and having a binding affinity (Kd) of 247 µM.

The morphology of corneal nerves has been studied extensively. However, corneal nerve function has only been studied in a limited fashion owing to a lack of tools. Here, we present a new system for studying corneal nerve function. Optical imaging was performed on the cornea of excised murine globes taken from a model animal expressing a genetically encoded calcium indicator, GCaMP6f, to record calcium transients. A custom perfusion and imaging chamber for ex vivo murine globes was designed to maintain and stabilize the cornea, while allowing the introduction of chemical stimulation during imaging. Imaging of calcium signals in the ex vivo murine cornea was demonstrated. Strong calcium signals with minimal photobleaching were observed in experiments lasting up to 10 minutes. Concentrated potassium and lidocaine solutions both modulated corneal nerve activity. Similar responses were observed in the same neurons across multiple chemical stimulations, suggesting the feasibility of using chemical stimulations to test the response of the corneal nerves. Our studies suggest that this tool will be of great use for studying functional changes to corneal nerves in response to disease and ocular procedures. This process will enable preclinical testing of new ocular procedures to minimize damage to corneal innervation and therapies for diminished neural function.",

Recently, red and green genetically encoded sensors for DA (dLight, GRAB-DA) were developed and now provide the ability to track release dynamics at a subsecond resolution, with submicromolar affinity and high molecular specificity. Combined with rapid developments in in vivo imaging, these sensors have the potential to transform the field of DA sensing and DA-based drug discovery. When implementing these tools in the laboratory, it is important to consider there is not a 'one-size-fits-all' sensor. Sensor properties, most importantly their affinity and dynamic range, must be carefully chosen to match local DA levels. Molecular specificity, sensor kinetics, spectral properties, brightness, sensor scaffold and pharmacology can further influence sensor choice depending on the experimental question. In this review, we use DA as an example; we briefly summarize old and new techniques to monitor DA release, including DA biosensors. We then outline a map of DA heterogeneity across the brain and provide a guide for optimal sensor choice and implementation based on local DA levels and other experimental parameters.

However, the exploration of plant nanobiotechnology is still in its outset. The search for novel tools to monitor plant biomolecules is an emerging issue for the nanobiotechnologists. Given this, a genetically encoded FRET-based nanobiosensor has been developed to monitor the popular plant cardiac glycoside - digoxin, which is used as the most common prescription drug for heart-related illnesses across the world. Digoxin is sourced from the leaves of the foxglove plant (Digitalis purpurea L.) and has a significant demand in the medical sector. Moreover, with the rising popularity of the herbal formulations in the global market, attention towards the authentication and quality control of the herbal drugs is important. Furthermore, digoxin has a very narrow therapeutic range, i.e., 0.6 nM - 2.6 nM. Therefore, strict monitoring of blood digoxin levels is necessary. Besides, previously used techniques for drug authentication and quantification of small-molecule drugs in blood samples are not the best choice available. The nanobiosensor is based on the FRET (Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer) mechanism, and it is constructed in such a way that it gives a changed FRET output in the presence of digoxin. Two fluorophores, enhanced cyan fluorescent protein (ECFP) and Venus, were attached on either end of the sensory domain - human nuclear receptor ROR-gamma (RORγt). The developed nanobiosensor was named as fluorescent indicator protein for digoxin, (FLIP-digoxin). The ligand binding affinity of FLIP-digoxin was calculated as 425 μM. Affinity mutants of the FLIP-digoxin were also generated to measure digoxin in wide concentration ranges. This sensor offers high-throughput qualitative analysis of digoxin in Digitalis preparations procured from local drug stores. It confirms the authenticity of the preparations through the detection of digoxin. The FLIP-1n was also able to monitor digoxin concentration in serum samples in lesser than 5 min. The nanobiosensor was found pH stable, digoxin-specific, non- interfered by the biological serum species and can perform high throughput screening of the Digitalis powder, infusion and tincture preparations.",

We introduce rsCaMPARI, a genetically encoded calcium marker engineered from a reversibly switchable fluorescent protein that enables spatiotemporally precise marking, erasing, and remarking of active neuron populations under brief, user-defined time windows of light exposure. rsCaMPARI photoswitching kinetics are modulated by calcium concentration when illuminating with blue light, and the fluorescence can be reset with violet light. We demonstrate the utility of rsCaMPARI for marking and remarking active neuron populations in freely swimming zebrafish.",

        "abstract": "Zebrafish embryos have been proposed as a cost-effective vertebrate model to study heart function. Many fluorescent genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicators (GECIs) have been developed, but those with ratiometric readout seem more appropriate to image a moving organ such as the heart. Four ratiometric GECIs based on troponin C, TN-XXL, Twitch-1, Twitch-2B, and Twitch-4 were expressed transiently in the heart of zebrafish embryos. Their emission ratio reported the Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels in both the atrium and the ventricle. We measured several kinetic parameters of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients: systolic and diastolic ratio, the amplitude of the systolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> rise, the heart rate, as well as the rise and decay times and slopes. The systolic ratio change decreased in cells expressing high biosensor concentration, possibly caused by Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffering. The GECIs were able to report the effect of nifedipine and propranolol on the heart, which resulted in changes in heart rate, diastolic and systolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels, and Ca<sup>2+</sup> kinetics. As a result, Twitch-1 and Twitch-4 (<i>K</i>d 0.25 and 2.8 µM, respectively) seem the most promising GECIs for generating transgenic zebrafish lines, which could be used for modeling heart disorders, for drug screening, and for cardiotoxicity assessment during drug development.",

However, many selenoproteins involved cellular functions still remains unclear. In addition, since biothiols such as glutathione (GSH, pK<sub>a</sub> 8.3), possessing similar chemical properties with Sec, commonly exist in living systems at high levels. Thus, it is of great importance and high challenge to identify novel probes for selectively monitoring Sec over biothiols. In this paper, we proposed a smart strategy which allowed us to develop a lysosome targetable probe for specifically sensing Sec. By restricting weak acidic microenvironment, the probe shows a specific detection for Sec with 85-fold fluorescence enhancement owing to the remaining high activity of Sec at pH 5.0. Moreover, being low cytotoxicity to the cells verified by MTS assay, the probe was then successfully applied for imaging exogenous and endogenous Sec in lysosomes, indicating its potential for the biological investigation of Sec in subcellular organelles.",

However, how neural activity underlying the sleep-wake cycle controls adenosine release in the brain remains unclear. Using a newly developed genetically encoded adenosine sensor, we found an activity-dependent rapid increase in the concentration of extracellular adenosine in mouse basal forebrain (BF), a critical region controlling sleep and wakefulness. Although the activity of both BF cholinergic and glutamatergic neurons correlated with changes in the concentration of adenosine, optogenetic activation of these neurons at physiological firing frequencies showed that glutamatergic neurons contributed much more to the adenosine increase. Mice with selective ablation of BF glutamatergic neurons exhibited a reduced adenosine increase and impaired sleep homeostasis regulation.

To visualize local connections, we previously developed a genetically encoded fluorescent indicator, GRAPHIC, which labels cell-cell contacts by restricting the reconstituted green fluorescent protein (GFP) signal to the contact site. Here, we modify GRAPHIC to give the reconstituted GFP motility within the membrane, to detect cells that make contact with other specific cells. Removal of leucine zipper domains, located between the split GFP fragment and glycophosphatidylinositol anchor domain, allowed GFP reconstituted at the contact site to diffuse throughout the entire plasma membrane, revealing cell morphology. Further, depending on the structural spacers employed, the reconstituted GFP could be selectively targeted to N terminal (NT)- or C terminal (CT)-probe-expressing cells. Using these novel constructs, we demonstrated that we can specifically label NT-probe-expressing cells that made contact with CT-probe-expressing cells in an epithelial cell culture and in Xenopus 8-cell-stage blastomeres. Moreover, we showed that diffusible GRAPHIC (dGRAPHIC) can be used in neuronal circuits to trace neurons that make contact to reveal a connection map. Finally, application in the developing brain demonstrated that the dGRAPHIC signal remained on neurons that had transient contacts during circuit development to reveal the contact history. Altogether, dGRAPHIC is a unique probe that can visualize cells that made specific cell-cell contact.",

To quantify cellular cAMP concentrations, we bacterially over-expressed and purified Epac1-camps and applied the purified protein in a cell-free detection assay for cAMP in a multi-well format. We found that the biosensor can detect as little as 0.15 pmol of cAMP, and that the sensitivity is not impaired by non-physiological salt concentrations or pH values. Notably, the assay tolerated desiccation and storage of the protein without affecting Epac1-camps cyclic nucleotide sensitivity.

        "abstract": "Intracellular calcium can be monitored by various calcium-specific fluorescent dyes including gene-encoded calcium indicators (GECI). GCaMP is a widely-used GECI that emits green fluorescence proportional to the level of intracellular calcium. However, since many tagging proteins also emit green fluorescence, GCaMP cannot be used with another green fluorescent protein. Therefore, it would be ideal to develop a GECI that has a distinct color profile other than green. In this regard, we developed a novel blue fluorescent calcium indicator modified from GCaMP called Ser<sup>222</sup>-Ala<sup>229</sup>-Cys<sup>330</sup>-BCaMP3. Specifically, a simple threonine to histidine substitution to a green fluorescent Cys<sup>330</sup>-GCaMP3 successfully changed its fluorescence to blue (Cys<sup>330</sup>-BCaMP3, B for blue). Furthermore, a couple of additional amino acid substitutions resulted in more enhanced blue fluorescence intensity. Among other Cys<sup>330</sup>-BCaMP3 variants, it was found that Ser<sup>222</sup>-Ala<sup>229</sup>-Cys<sup>330</sup>-BCaMP3 exhibited the strongest blue fluorescence intensity. When Ser<sup>222</sup>-Ala<sup>229</sup>-Cys<sup>330</sup>-BCaMP3 was co-expressed with TRPA1 - a non-selective cation channel - in HEK293T cells, it showed moderate blue fluorescence. One of the drawbacks of Ser<sup>222</sup>-Ala<sup>229</sup>-Cys<sup>330</sup>-BCaMP3 was that the fluorescence intensity was not enough when cells were cultured under 37°C. However, this limitation was circumvented by lowering cell culture temperature to 28°C, allowing much more enhanced blue fluorescence. Although Ser<sup>222</sup>-Ala<sup>229</sup>-Cys<sup>330</sup>-BCaMP3 mandates further optimization, the present study has found a promising blue fluorescent GECI that is derived from GCaMP3.",

We showed that either MiniE or MiniR could serve as the genetically encoded tag. Next, we demonstrated MiniVIPER's versatility by generating five spectrally distinct probe peptides to label tagged TfR1 on live cells. Lastly, we demonstrated two new applications for VIP tags. First, we used MiniVIPER in combination with another VIP tag, VIPER, to selectively label two different proteins in a single cell (e.g., TfR1 with H2B or TOMM20). Second, we used MiniVIPER to translocate a fluorescent protein to the nucleus through in situ dimerization of mCherry with H2B-mEmerald.

Current redox sensitive dyes and fluorescent proteins can quantify spatially distinct changes in reactive oxygen species levels, but multicolor probes are needed to accurately analyze compartment-specific redox dynamics in single cells that can be masked by population averaging. We previously engineered genetically encoded red-shifted redox-sensitive fluorescent protein sensors using a Förster resonance energy transfer relay strategy. Here, we developed a second-generation excitation ratiometric sensor called rogRFP2 with improved red emission for quantitative live-cell imaging. Using this sensor to measure activity-dependent redox changes in individual cultured neurons, we observed an anticorrelation in which mitochondrial oxidation was accompanied by a concurrent reduction in the cytosol. This behavior was dependent on the activity of Complex I of the mitochondrial electron transport chain and could be modulated by the presence of cocultured astrocytes. We also demonstrated that the red fluorescent rogRFP2 facilitates ratiometric one- and two-photon redox imaging in rat brain slices and Drosophila retinas.

Geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP), and to a lesser extent other isoprenoid pyrophosphates, interfere with the binding of CrtR to its target DNA in vitro, suggesting they act as inducers of carotenoid biosynthesis. CrtR homologs are encoded in the genomes of many other actinobacteria. In order to determine if and to what extent the function of CrtR, as a metabolite-dependent transcriptional repressor of carotenoid biosynthesis genes responding to GGPP, is conserved among <i>actinobacteria</i>, five CrtR orthologs were characterized in more detail. EMSA assays showed that the CrtR orthologs from <i>Corynebacterium</i><i>callunae</i>, <i>Acidipropionibacterium</i><i>jensenii</i>, <i>Paenarthrobacter</i><i>nicotinovorans</i>, <i>Micrococcus</i><i>luteus</i> and <i>Pseudarthrobacter</i><i>chlorophenolicus</i> bound to the intergenic region between their own gene and the divergently oriented gene, and that GGPP inhibited these interactions. In turn, the CrtR protein from <i>C. glutamicum</i> bound to DNA regions upstream of the orthologous <i>crtR</i> genes that contained a 15 bp DNA sequence motif conserved between the tested bacteria. Moreover, the CrtR orthologs functioned in <i>C. glutamicum</i> in vivo at least partially, as they complemented the defects in the pigmentation and expression of a P<i>crtE</i>_<i>gfp</i>uv transcriptional fusion that were observed in a <i>crtR</i> deletion mutant to varying degrees.

        "abstract": "To understand the role of intracellular metabolites in cellular processes, it is important to measure the dynamics and fluxes of small molecules in living cells. Although conventional metabolite sensors composed of fluorescent proteins have been made to detect some metabolites, an emerging approach is to use genetically encoded sensors composed of RNA. Because of the ability to rapidly generate metabolite-binding RNA aptamers, RNA-based sensors have the potential to be designed more readily than protein-based sensors. Numerous strategies have been developed to convert the green-fluorescent Spinach or Broccoli fluorogenic RNA aptamers into metabolite-regulated sensors. Nevertheless, red fluorescence is particularly desirable because of the low level of red background fluorescence in cells. However, the red fluorescent variant of the Broccoli aptamer, Red Broccoli, does not exhibit red fluorescence in cells when imaged with its cognate fluorophore. It is not known why Red Broccoli is fluorescent <i>in vitro</i> but not in live mammalian cells. Here, we develop a new fluorophore, OBI (3,5-difluoro-4-hydroxybenzylidene-imidazolinone-2-oxime-1-benzoimidazole), which binds Red Broccoli with high affinity and makes Red Broccoli resistant to thermal unfolding. We show that OBI enables Red Broccoli to be readily detected in live mammalian cells. Furthermore, we show that Red Broccoli can be fused to a <i>S</i>-adenosyl methionine (SAM)-binding aptamer to generate a red fluorescent RNA-based sensor that enables imaging of SAM in live mammalian cells. These results reveal a red fluorescent fluorogenic aptamer that functions in mammalian cells and that can be readily developed into red fluorescent RNA-based sensors.",

        "abstract": "In yeast, adaptation to varying conditions often requires proper regulation of the plasma membrane potential. To determine yeast membrane potential change, optical methods involving potentiometric dyes have been supplemental to the direct electrode-based method. However, the hydrophobic nature of the dyes and their slow distribution across the membrane still limits their utilization. Genetically encoded voltage indicator (GEVI) proteins employed in neuroscience offer a tantalizing alternative for monitoring yeast membrane potential change. In this work, several widely used GEVI proteins were assessed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae for their expression and function as a voltage reporter. Among them, only ArcLight and Accelerated Sensor of Action Potential (ASAP) proteins could be expressed and transported to the plasma membrane. While the voltage-sensing capability was demonstrated for both ArcLight and ASAP, ArcLight fluorescence was sensitive to the intracellular pH change concurrently with the voltage change. Therefore, we established that ASAP is the more suitable GEVI protein for reporting yeast membrane potential change. This voltage-sensing reporter for yeast based on ASAP offers a new effective strategy for real-time optical detection of yeast membrane potential change, which potentially facilitates many areas of yeast research including optimizing growth conditions for industrial use and investigating yeast ion transport system.",

        "abstract": "Changes in transcellular bioelectrical patterns are known to play important roles during developmental and regenerative processes. The Drosophila follicular epithelium has proven to be an appropriate model system for studying the mechanisms by which bioelectrical signals emerge and act. Fluorescent indicator dyes in combination with various inhibitors of ion-transport mechanisms have been used to investigate the generation of membrane potentials (V<sub>mem</sub>) and intracellular pH (pH<sub>i</sub>). Both parameters as well as their anteroposterior and dorsoventral gradients were affected by the inhibitors which, in addition, led to alterations of microfilament and microtubule patterns equivalent to those observed during follicle-cell differentiation. We expressed two genetically-encoded fluorescent sensors for V<sub>mem</sub> and pH<sub>i</sub>, ArcLight and pHluorin-Moesin, in the follicular epithelium of Drosophila. By means of the respective inhibitors, we obtained comparable effects on V<sub>mem</sub> and/or pH<sub>i</sub> as previously described for V<sub>mem</sub>- and pH<sub>i</sub>-sensitive fluorescent dyes. In a RNAi-knockdown screen, five genes of ion-transport mechanisms and gap-junction subunits were identified exerting influence on ovary development and/or oogenesis. Loss of ovaries or small ovaries were the results of soma knockdowns of the innexins inx1 and inx3, and of the DEG/ENaC family member ripped pocket (rpk). Germline knockdown of rpk also resulted in smaller ovaries. Soma knockdown of the V-ATPase-subunit vha55 caused size-reduced ovaries with degenerating follicles from stage 10A onward. In addition, soma knockdown of the open rectifier K<sup>+</sup>channel 1 (ork1) resulted in a characteristic round-egg phenotype with altered microfilament and microtubule organisation in the follicular epithelium. The genetic tool box of Drosophila provides means for a refined and extended analysis of bioelectrical phenomena. Tissue-specifically expressed V<sub>mem</sub>- and pH<sub>i</sub>-sensors exhibit some practical advantages compared to fluorescent indicator dyes. Their use confirms that the ion-transport mechanisms targeted by inhibitors play important roles in the generation of bioelectrical signals. Moreover, modulation of bioelectrical signals via RNAi-knockdown of genes coding for ion-transport mechanisms and gap-junction subunits exerts influence on crucial processes during ovary development and results in cytoskeletal changes and altered follicle shape. Thus, further evidence amounts for bioelectrical regulation of developmental processes via the control of both signalling pathways and cytoskeletal organisation.",

The sensitivity of the indicator to lactate and pyruvate was characterized through changes in the fluorescence FRET ratio and validated with isothermal titration calorimetry. Lapronic was insensitive to physiological pH and temperature and did not respond to structurally related molecules acetate and β-hydroxybutyrate or cofactors NAD<sup>+</sup> and NADH. Lapronic was expressed in HEK 293 cells showing a homogeneous cytosolic localization and was also targeted to the mitochondrial matrix.

Little is known about whether and how Orai1 channel activity may vary between individual puncta. Previously, we developed and validated optical recording of Orai channel activity, using genetically encoded Ca2+ indicators fused to Orai1 or Orai3 N or C termini. We have now combined total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy with whole-cell recording to map functional properties of channels at individual puncta. After Ca2+ store depletion in HEK cells cotransfected with mCherry-STIM1 and Orai1-GCaMP6f, Orai1-GCaMP6f fluorescence increased progressively with increasingly negative test potentials and robust responses could be recorded from individual puncta. Cell-wide fluorescence half-rise and -fall times during steps to -100 mV test potential indicated probe response times of <50 ms. The in situ Orai1-GCaMP6f affinity for Ca2+ was 620 nM, assessed by monitoring fluorescence using buffered Ca2+ solutions in \"unroofed\" cells. Channel activity and temporal activation profile were tracked in individual puncta using image maps and automated puncta identification and recording. Simultaneous measurement of mCherry-STIM1 fluorescence uncovered an unexpected gradient in STIM1/Orai1 ratio that extends across the cell surface. Orai1-GCaMP6f channel activity was found to vary across the cell, with inactive channels occurring in the corners of cells where the STIM1/Orai1 ratio was lowest; low-activity channels typically at edges displayed a slow activation phase lasting hundreds of milliseconds. Puncta with high STIM1/Orai1 ratios exhibited a range of channel activity that appeared unrelated to the stoichiometric requirements for gating. These findings demonstrate functional heterogeneity of Orai1 channel activity between individual puncta and establish a new experimental platform that facilitates systematic comparisons between puncta composition and activity.",

To date, little is known on the behaviour of individual hypoxic tumour cells in their microenvironment. To explore this issue in a spatial and temporally controlled manner, we developed a genetically encoded sensor by fusing the O<sub>2</sub>-labile hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) protein to eGFP and a tamoxifen-regulated Cre recombinase. Under normoxic conditions, HIF-1α is degraded but, under hypoxia, the HIF-1α-GFP-Cre-ER<sup>T2</sup> fusion protein is stabilised and in the presence of tamoxifen activates a tdTomato reporter gene that is constitutively expressed in hypoxic progeny. We visualise the random distribution of hypoxic tumour cells from hypoxic or necrotic regions and vascularised areas using immunofluorescence and intravital microscopy. Once tdTomato expression is induced, it is stable for at least 4 weeks. Using this system, we could show <i>in vivo</i> that the post-hypoxic cells were more proliferative than non-labelled cells. Our results demonstrate that single-cell lineage tracing of hypoxic tumour cells can allow visualisation of their behaviour in living tumours using intravital microscopy.

Today, major efforts are devoted toward optimizing red-emitting [red fluorescent protein (RFP)-based] GECIs (R-GECI), as these provide several advantages over GFP-based reporters, for instance, increased imaging depth, reduced photodamage by longer imaging wavelengths and, in principle, are better suited for use with prevalent blue-absorbing optogenetic tools (e.g., channelrhodopsin). However, excessive fluorescence from intersecting neighboring cells in very dense tissues, notably the brain, hinders the ability to collect signals from single cells and their processes. This challenge can be addressed by photoactivatable (PA) fluorescent proteins that can be rendered fluorescent <i>on demand</i> by user-defined targeted light. This allows activation and, thereby, collection of fluorescent signals exclusively from desired cells and their processes, while leaving all neighboring cells in the dark (i.e., non-fluorescent).

        "abstract": "Linking neural circuitry to behavior by mapping active neurons <i>in vivo</i> is a challenge. Both genetically encoded calcium indicators (GECIs) and intermediate early genes (IEGs) have been used to pinpoint active neurons during a stimulus or behavior but have drawbacks such as limiting the movement of the organism, requiring <i>a priori</i> knowledge of the active region or having poor temporal resolution. Calcium-modulated photoactivatable ratiometric integrator (CaMPARI) was engineered to overcome these spatial-temporal challenges. CaMPARI is a photoconvertible protein that only converts from green to red fluorescence in the presence of high calcium concentration and 405 nm light. This allows the experimenter to precisely mark active neurons within defined temporal windows. The photoconversion can then be quantified by taking the ratio of the red fluorescence to the green. CaMPARI promises the ability to trace active neurons during a specific stimulus; however, CaMPARI's uses in adult <i>Drosophila</i> have been limited to photoconversion during fly immobilization. Here, we demonstrate a method that allows photoconversion of multiple freely-moving intact adult flies during a stimulus. Flies were placed in a dish with filter paper wet with acetic acid (pH = 2) or neutralized acetic acid (pH = 7) and exposed to photoconvertible light (60 mW) for 30 min (500 ms on, 200 ms off). Immediately following photoconversion, whole flies were fixed and imaged by confocal microscopy. The red:green ratio was quantified for the DC4 glomerulus, a bundle of neurons expressing <i>Ir64a</i>, an ionotropic receptor that senses acids in the <i>Drosophila</i> antennal lobe. Flies exposed to acetic acid showed 1.3-fold greater photoconversion than flies exposed to neutralized acetic acid. This finding was recapitulated using a more physiological stimulus of apple cider vinegar. These results indicate that CaMPARI can be used to label neurons in intact, freely-moving adult flies and will be useful for identifying the circuitry underlying complex behaviors.",

Although previous studies demonstrated the potential for using 7-HCAA as an acceptor for tryptophan, this approach has not yet been explored within a single protein containing multiple tryptophan residues. A structure-based analysis of a hexokinase enzyme with multiple native tryptophan residues identified glutamate 50 as a potential site of 7-HCAA incorporation; Glu50 moves closer to the native tryptophans upon substrate binding. Substitution of 7-HCAA at residue 50 led to an increase in FRET efficiency in the presence of the substrate; this effect was not observed in a control protein where no change in distance between 7-HCAA and the native tryptophans occurs on substrate binding. This system was then used to directly observe differences in binding affinity of the hexokinase that occur at a number of pH values. Our approach builds on previous research in that it eliminates the need for the incorporation of multiple fNCAAs or fluorescent labels within a target protein and can be used to study substrate binding with native ligands. As such, it serves to expand the versatility of FRET-based techniques.",

Genetically encoded RNA-based sensors are emerging powerful tools for this purpose. However, it was challenging to use these sensors to precisely determine the intracellular concentrations of target analytes. To solve this problem, we have recently developed ratiometric sensors using an orthogonal pair of RNA/fluorophore conjugates: Broccoli/DFHBI-1T (3,5-difluoro-4-hydroxybenzylidene-1-trifluoroethyl-imidazolinone) and DNB (dinitroaniline-binding aptamer)/SR-DN (sulforhodamine B-dinitroaniline). The cellular DNB-to-Broccoli fluorescence intensity ratio can be directly applied to quantify the target concentrations at the single-cell level. Unfortunately, due to the instability of the SR-DN dye, this ratiometric sensor is difficult to use for monitoring target dynamics. Herein, by replacing SR-DN with a stable TMR (tetramethylrhodamine)-DN dye, we developed a ratiometric sensor system based on Broccoli/DFHBI-1T and DNB/TMR-DN, which can be used for dynamic imaging in living cells.

As compared to popular GCaMP GECIs, the FGCaMP indicator benefits from calmodulin and M13-peptide from the fungi <i>Aspergillus niger</i> and <i>Aspergillus fumigatus</i>, which prevent its interaction with the intracellular environment. However, FGCaMP exhibits a two-phase fluorescence behavior with the variation of calcium ion concentration, has moderate sensitivity in neurons (as compared to the GCaMP6s indicator), and has not been fully characterized in vitro and in vivo. To address these limitations, we developed an enhanced version of FGCaMP, called FGCaMP7. FGCaMP7 preserves the ratiometric phenotype of FGCaMP, with a 3.1-fold larger ratiometric dynamic range in vitro. FGCaMP7 demonstrates 2.7- and 8.7-fold greater photostability compared to mEGFP and mTagBFP2 fluorescent proteins in vitro, respectively. The ratiometric response of FGCaMP7 is 1.6- and 1.4-fold higher, compared to the intensiometric response of GCaMP6s, in non-stimulated and stimulated neuronal cultures, respectively. We reveal the inertness of FGCaMP7 to the intracellular environment of HeLa cells using its truncated version with a deleted M13-like peptide; in contrast to the similarly truncated variant of GCaMP6s. We characterize the crystal structure of the parental FGCaMP indicator. Finally, we test the in vivo performance of FGCaMP7 in mouse brain using a two-photon microscope and an NVista miniscope; and in zebrafish using two-color ratiometric confocal imaging.",

Here, we demonstrate the use of Archon1, a recently developed GEVI, in hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (CMs). When expressed in CMs, Archon1 demonstrated fast kinetics comparable with patch-clamp electrophysiology and high SNR significantly greater than the VSD Di-8-ANEPPS. Additionally, Archon1 enabled monitoring of APs across multiple cells simultaneously in 3D cardiac tissues.

Here, we engineered a FRET (fluorescence resonance energy transfer) based sensor for sulfate, which is genetically-encoded and named as FLIP-SP (Fluorescent indicator protein for sulfate). The FLIP-SP can measure the level of the sulfate in live cells. This sensor was constructed by the fusion of fluorescent proteins at the N- and C-terminus of sulfate binding protein (sbp). The FLIP-SP is highly specific to sulfate, and showed pH stability. Real-time monitoring of the level of sulfate in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells showed sensor bio-compatibility with living cells.

        "abstract": "(+)-Catechin is an important antioxidant of green tea (<i>Camelia sinensis</i> (L.) O. Kuntze). Catechin is known for its positive role in anticancerous activity, extracellular matrix degradation, cell death regulation, diabetes, and other related disorders. As a result of enormous interest in and great demand for catechin, its biosynthesis using metabolic engineering has become the subject of concentrated research with the aim of enhancing (+)-catechin production. Metabolic flux is an essential concept in the practice of metabolic engineering as it helps in the identification of the regulatory element of a biosynthetic pathway. In the present study, an attempt was made to analyze the metabolic flux of the (+)-catechin biosynthesis pathway in order to decipher the regulatory element of this pathway. Firstly, a genetically encoded fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based nanosensor (FLIP-Cat, fluorescence indicator protein for (+)-catechin) was developed for real-time monitoring of (+)-catechin flux. <i>In vitro</i> characterization of the purified protein of the nanosensor showed that the nanosensor was pH stable and (+)-catechin specific. Its calculated <i>K</i><sub>d</sub> was 139 µM. The nanosensor also performed real-time monitoring of (+)-catechin in bacterial cells. In the second step of this study, an entire (+)-catechin biosynthesis pathway was constructed and expressed in <i>E. coli</i> in two sets of plasmid constructs: pET26b-PT7-rbs-PAL-PT7-rbs-4CL-PT7-rbs-CHS-PT7-rbs-CHI and pET26b-T7-rbs-F3H-PT7-rbs- DFR-PT7-rbs-LCR. The <i>E. coli</i> harboring the FLIP-Cat was transformed with these plasmid constructs. The metabolic flux analysis of (+)-catechin was carried out using the FLIP-Cat. The FLIP-Cat successfully monitored the flux of catechin after adding tyrosine, 4-coumaric acid, 4-coumaroyl CoA, naringenin chalcone, naringenin, dihydroquercetin, and leucocyanidin, individually, with the bacterial cells expressing the nanosensor as well as the genes of the (+)-catechin biosynthesis pathway. Dihydroflavonol reductase (DFR) was identified as the main regulatory element of the (+)-catechin biosynthesis pathway. Information about this regulatory element of the (+)-catechin biosynthesis pathway can be used for manipulating the (+)-catechin biosynthesis pathway using a metabolic engineering approach to enhance production of (+)-catechin.",

        "abstract": "Synapses are highly compartmentalized functional units that operate independently on each other. In Huntington's disease (HD) and other neurodegenerative disorders, this independence might be compromised due to insufficient glutamate clearance and the resulting spill-in and spill-out effects. Altered astrocytic coverage of the presynaptic terminals and/or dendritic spines as well as a reduced size of glutamate transporter clusters at glutamate release sites have been implicated in the pathogenesis of diseases resulting in symptoms of dys-/hyperkinesia. However, the mechanisms leading to the dysfunction of glutamatergic synapses in HD are not well understood. Improving and applying synapse imaging we have obtained data shedding new light on the mechanisms impeding the initiation of movements. Here, we describe the principle elements of a relatively inexpensive approach to achieve single synapse resolution by using the new genetically encoded ultrafast glutamate sensor iGluu, wide-field optics, a scientific CMOS (sCMOS) camera, a 473 nm laser and a laser positioning system to evaluate the state of corticostriatal synapses in acute slices from age appropriate healthy or diseased mice. Glutamate transients were constructed from single or multiple pixels to obtain estimates of i) glutamate release based on the maximal elevation of the glutamate concentration [Glu] next to the active zone and ii) glutamate uptake as reflected in the time constant of decay (TauD) of the perisynaptic [Glu]. Differences in the resting bouton size and contrasting patterns of short-term plasticity served as criteria for the identification of corticostriatal terminals as belonging to the intratelencephalic (IT) or the pyramidal tract (PT) pathway. Using these methods, we discovered that in symptomatic HD mice ~40% of PT-type corticostriatal synapses exhibited insufficient glutamate clearance, suggesting that these synapses might be at risk to excitotoxic damage. The results underline the usefulness of TauD as a biomarker of dysfunctional synapses in Huntington mice with a hypokinetic phenotype.",

Measuring the blood lead level (BLL) is the only way to officially evaluate the degree of exposure to lead. The so-called \"safe value\" of the BLL seems to unreliably represent the secure threshold for children. In general, lead's underlying toxicological mechanism remains unclear and needs to be elucidated. Therefore, we developed a novel genetically encoded fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based lead biosensor, Met-lead, and applied it to transgenic Drosophila to perform further investigations. We combined Met-lead with the <i>UAS-GAL4</i> system to the sensor protein specifically expressed within certain regions of fly brains. Using a suitable imaging platform, including a fast epifluorescent or confocal laser-scanning/two-photon microscope with high resolution, we recorded the changes in lead content inside fly brains ex vivo and in vivo and at different life stages. The blood-brain barrier was found to play an important role in the protection of neurons in the brain against damage due to the heavy metal lead, either through food or microinjection into the abdomen. Met-lead has the potential to be a powerful tool for the sensing of lead within living organisms by employing either a fast epi-FRET microscope or high-resolution brain imaging.",

The classical Hebbian paradigm of synaptic memory, long-term potentiation (LTP) of transmission, has been widely associated with an increase in the postsynaptic receptor current. Whether and to what degree LTP induction also enhances presynaptic glutamate release has been the subject of debate. Here, we took advantage of the recently developed genetically encoded optical sensors of glutamate (iGluSnFR) to monitor its release at CA3-CA1 synapses in acute hippocampal slices, before and after the induction of LTP. We attempted to trace release events at multiple synapses simultaneously, by using two-photon excitation imaging in fast frame-scanning mode. We thus detected a significant increase in the average iGluSnFR signal during potentiation, which lasted for up to 90 min. This increase may reflect an increased amount of released glutamate or, alternatively, reduced glutamate binding to high-affinity glutamate transporters that compete with iGluSnFR.",

        "abstract": "Phototransduction in <i>Drosophila</i> is mediated by phospholipase C (PLC) and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable TRP channels, but the function of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores in this important model for Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling remains obscure. We therefore expressed a low affinity Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator (ER-GCaMP6-150) in the ER, and measured its fluorescence both in dissociated ommatidia and <i>in vivo</i> from intact flies of both sexes. Blue excitation light induced a rapid (tau ∼0.8 s), PLC-dependent decrease in fluorescence, representing depletion of ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores, followed by a slower decay, typically reaching ∼50% of initial dark-adapted levels, with significant depletion occurring under natural levels of illumination. The ER stores refilled in the dark within 100-200 s. Both rapid and slow store depletion were largely unaffected in InsP<sub>3</sub> receptor mutants, but were much reduced in <i>trp</i> mutants. Strikingly, rapid (but not slow) depletion of ER stores was blocked by removing external Na<sup>+</sup> and in mutants of the Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchanger, CalX, which we immuno-localized to ER membranes in addition to its established localization in the plasma membrane. Conversely, overexpression of <i>calx</i> greatly enhanced rapid depletion. These results indicate that rapid store depletion is mediated by Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchange across the ER membrane induced by Na<sup>+</sup> influx via the light-sensitive channels. Although too slow to be involved in channel activation, this Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchange-dependent release explains the decades-old observation of a light-induced rise in cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> in photoreceptors exposed to Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free solutions.<b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Phototransduction in <i>Drosophila</i> is mediated by phospholipase C, which activates TRP cation channels by an unknown mechanism. Despite much speculation, it is unknown whether endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores play any role. We therefore engineered flies expressing a genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator in the photoreceptor ER. Although NCX Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchangers are classically believed to operate only at the plasma membrane, we demonstrate a rapid light-induced depletion of ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores mediated by Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchange across the ER membrane. This NCX-dependent release was too slow to be involved in channel activation, but explains the decades-old observation of a light-induced rise in cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> in photoreceptors bathed in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free solutions.",

However, most of them are based on the EGFP protein and have similar molecular brightnesses. The NTnC indicator, which is composed of the mNeonGreen fluorescent protein with the insertion of troponin C, has higher brightness as compared to EGFP-based GECIs, but shows a limited inverted response with an ΔF/F of 1. By insertion of a calmodulin/M13-peptide pair into the mNeonGreen protein, we developed a green GECI called NCaMP7. In vitro, NCaMP7 showed positive response with an ΔF/F of 27 and high affinity (K<sub>d</sub> of 125 nM) to calcium ions. NCaMP7 demonstrated a 1.7-fold higher brightness and similar calcium-association/dissociation dynamics compared to the standard GCaMP6s GECI in vitro. According to fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments, the NCaMP7 design partially prevented interactions of NCaMP7 with the intracellular environment. The NCaMP7 crystal structure was obtained at 1.75 Å resolution to uncover the molecular basis of its calcium ions sensitivity. The NCaMP7 indicator retained a high and fast response when expressed in cultured HeLa and neuronal cells.

The sensor is the improved version of previously reported SenVitAL and consists of ECFP/venus as FRET pair instead of the originally used pair CFP/YFP. To increase the physiological range of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> measurement, affinity mutants were created.

The role of Ca<sup>2+</sup> -messaging during the activation of endothelial cells is well recognized and routinely measured by synthetic Ca<sup>2+</sup> -sensitive fluorophors. However, these compounds require fresh loading immediately before each experiment and in particular when grown in state-of-the-art 3D cell culture systems, endothelial cells are difficult to access with such sensors. Therefore, we developed transgenic pigs expressing a Ca<sup>2+</sup> -sensitive protein and examined its principal characteristics. Primary transgenic endothelial cells stimulated by ATP showed a definite and short influx of Ca<sup>2+</sup> into the cytosol, whereas exposure to human serum resulted in a more intense and sustained response. Surprisingly, not all endothelial cells reacted identically to a stimulus, rather activation took place in adjacent cells in a timely decelerated way and with distinct intensities. This effect was again more pronounced when cells were stimulated with human serum. Finally, we show clear evidence that antibody binding alone significantly activated endothelial cells, whereas antibody depletion dramatically reduced the stimulatory potential of serum. Transgenic porcine endothelial cells expressing a Ca<sup>2+</sup> -sensor represent an interesting tool to dissect factors inducing activation of porcine endothelial cells after exposure to human blood or serum.",

        "abstract": "The kinetics/dynamics of signaling are of increasing value for G-protein-coupled receptor therapeutic development, including spatiotemporal signaling and the kinetic context of biased agonism. Effective application of signaling kinetics to developing new therapeutics requires reliable kinetic assays and an analysis framework to extract kinetic pharmacological parameters. Here we describe a platform for measuring arrestin recruitment kinetics to GPCRs using a high quantum yield, genetically encoded fluorescent biosensor, and a data analysis framework to quantify the recruitment kinetics. The sensor enabled high temporal resolution measurement of arrestin recruitment to the angiotensin AT<sub>1</sub> and vasopressin V<sub>2</sub> receptors. The analysis quantified the initial rate of arrestin recruitment (k<sub>τ</sub>), a biologically-meaningful kinetic drug efficacy parameter, by fitting time course data using routine curve-fitting methods. Biased agonism was assessed by comparing k<sub>τ</sub> values for arrestin recruitment with those for Gq signaling via the AT<sub>1</sub> receptor. The k<sub>τ</sub> ratio values were in good agreement with bias estimates from existing methods. This platform potentially improves and simplifies assessment of biased agonism because the same assay modality is used to compare pathways (potentially in the same cells), the analysis method is parsimonious and intuitive, and kinetic context is factored into the bias measurement.",

CD14-Fcε IgE, produced by the gene engineered antibodies (GEAs) technology, was used for the recognition of the target bacteria or lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Stable cell lines expressing GCaMP6s, a genetically encoded indicator of calcium flux, were first established for monitoring mast cell activation and improving detection sensitivity. The microfluidic system was designed to improve automation and control the reaction time. Once Gram-negative bacteria bound to the CD14-Fcε IgE on the RBL-2H3 cell surface, RBL-2H3 cell receptor (FcεRI)-induced Ca2+ signaling pathway was immediately activated to release Ca2+. The elevated intracellular Ca2+ triggers GCaMP6s for reporting the presence of Gram-negative bacteria. The developed biosensor was able to detect 80 CFU mL-1 Gram-negative bacteria within 2.5 min in pure culture samples. The biosensor was used to detect Gram-negative bacteria in pork samples. With its short screening time and easy operation, the proposed biosensor shows promise in future applications of foodborne pathogen testing in 1 h to 1 day.",

Knowledge of the cellular energy states and the underlying regulatory mechanisms is therefore key to understanding cell physiology and to design therapeutic interventions.

We applied synthetic biology approaches to design, engineer and validate a genetically encoded nano-sensor for cellular energy state, AMPfret. It employs the naturally evolved energy sensing of eukaryotic cells provided by the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Our synthetic nano-sensor relies on fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) to detect changes in ATP:ADP and ATP:AMP ratios both in vitro and in cells in vivo. Construction and iterative optimisation relied on ACEMBL, a parallelised DNA assembly and construct screening technology we developed, facilitated by a method we termed tandem recombineering (TR).

Here we present a sensing platform, termed proximity-activated imaging reporter (PAIR), which combines activity-based methionine bioconjugation and antibody labeling with proximity-dependent oligonucleotide-based amplification to monitor dynamic changes of a given analyte in cells and animals through context-dependent methionine labeling of specific protein targets. We establish this PAIR method to develop sensors for imaging reactive oxygen species (ROS) and calcium ions through oxaziridine-directed labeling of reactive methionine residues on β-actin and calmodulin (CaM), respectively, where the extent of methionine bioconjugation on these protein targets can serve as an indicator of oxidative stress or calcium status. In particular, application of PAIR to activity-based CaM detection provides a method for imaging integrated calcium activity in both in vitro cell and in vivo zebrafish models. By relying on native protein biochemistry, PAIR enables redox and metal imaging without introduction of external small molecules or genetically encoded indicators that can potentially buffer the natural/existing pools. This approach can be potentially generalized to target a broader range of analytes by pairing appropriate activity-based protein probes with protein detection reagents in a proximity-driven manner, providing a starting point not only for designing new sensors but also for monitoring endogenous activity of specific protein targets in biological specimens with spatial and temporal fidelity.",

However, our current understanding of physiological and pathological GSH changes at high spatial and temporal resolution is limited due to non-availability of practicable GSH-detection methods. In order to measure GSH at real-time, a ratiometric genetically encoded nanosensor was developed using fluorescent proteins and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) approach. The construction of the sensor involved the introduction of GSH binding protein (YliB) as a sensory domain between cyan fluorescent protein (CFP; FRET donor) and yellow fluorescent protein (YFP; FRET acceptor). The developed sensor, named as FLIP-G (Fluorescence Indicator Protein for Glutathione) was able to measure the GSH level under in vitro and in vivo conditions. When the purified FLIP-G was titrated with different concentrations of GSH, the FRET ratio increased with increase in GSH-concentration. The sensor was found to be specific for GSH and also stable to changes in pH. Moreover, in live bacterial cells, the constructed sensor enabled the real-time quantification of cytosolic GSH that is controlled by the oxidative stress level. When expressed in yeast cells, FRET ratio increased with the external supply of GSH to living cells. Therefore, as a valuable tool, the developed FLIP-G can monitor GSH level in living cells and also help in gaining new insights into GSH metabolism.",

To pair the speed and sensitivity of chemically synthesized fluorescent indicators with cell-type specific genetic methods, we here develop Rhodamine-based Voltage Reporters (RhoVR) that can be covalently tethered to genetically encoded, self-labeling enzymes. These chemical-genetic hybrids feature a photoinduced electron transfer triggered RhoVR voltage-sensitive indicator coupled to a chloroalkane HaloTag ligand through a long, water-soluble polyethylene glycol linker (RhoVR-Halo). When applied to cells, RhoVR-Halo dyes selectively and covalently bind to surface-expressed HaloTag enzyme on genetically modified cells. RhoVR-Halo dyes maintain high voltage sensitivities-up to 34% Δ<i>F</i>/<i>F</i> per 100 mV-and fast response times typical of untargeted RhoVRs, while gaining the selectivity of genetically encodable voltage indicators. We show that RhoVR-Halos can record action potentials in single trials from cultured rat hippocampal neurons and can be used in concert with green-fluorescent Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicators like GCaMP to provide simultaneous voltage and Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging. In a brain slice, RhoVR-Halos provide exquisite labeling of defined cells and can be imaged using epifluorescence, confocal, or two-photon microscopy. Using high-speed epifluorescence microscopy, RhoVR-Halos provide a read-out of action potentials from labeled cortical neurons in a rat brain slice, without the need for trial averaging. These results demonstrate the potential of hybrid chemical-genetic voltage indicators to combine the optical performance of small-molecule chromophores with the inherent selectivity of genetically encodable systems, permitting imaging modalities inaccessible to either technique individually.",

However, the ArcLight expression, in all cases, relied on a high number of lentiviral vector-mediated random genome integrations (8-12 copy/cell), raising concerns such as gene disruption and alteration of global and local gene expression, as well as loss or silencing of reporter genes after differentiation. Here, we report the use of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 nuclease technique to develop a hiPSC line stably expressing ArcLight from the AAVS1 safe harbor locus. The hiPSC line retained proliferative ability with a growth rate similar to its parental strain. Optical recording with conventional epifluorescence microscopy allowed the detection of APs as early as 21 days postdifferentiation, and could be repeatedly monitored for at least 5 months. Moreover, quantification and analysis of the APs of ArcLight-CMs identified two distinctive subtypes: a group with high frequency of spontaneous APs of small amplitudes that were pacemaker-like CMs and a group with low frequency of automaticity and large amplitudes that resembled the working CMs. Compared with FluoVolt voltage-sensitive dye, although dimmer, the ArcLight reporter exhibited better optical performance in terms of phototoxicity and photostability with comparable sensitivities and signal-to-noise ratios. The hiPSC line with targeted ArcLight engineering design represents a useful tool for studying cardiac development or hiPSC-derived cardiac disease models and drug testing.",

Using the mouse Thy1 mini-promoter, we generated a line of transgenic mice expressing a genetically encoded sensor for the simultaneous measurements of intracellular Cl<sup>-</sup> and pH.

        "abstract": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) initiates viral infection by binding its surface spike protein to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) receptor. Precise delineation of spike-hACE2 engagement is essential for viral entry and a prime target for therapeutic intervention. However, the current antiviral strategies provided only endpoint readouts and delayed the prioritization against emerging variants. Here, this study introduced novel antiviral compounds designed via a NanoLuc Binary Technology-based pseudovirus [NanoBiT; a structural complementation reporter composed of a Large BiT (LgBiT) and a Small BiT (SmBiT)]. Upon Omicron BA.2-SmBiT spike pseudoviruses infecting LgBiT-hACE2 cells, reconstituted NanoLuc generated quantifiable bioluminescence for real-time spike-hACE2 interaction during viral infection. Within this framework, dual-functional theranostic Anti-spike peptide (S7; ACTPHVSPTHCS) and the Anti-hACE2 peptide (A6; WSTDPGAHLRDY) were identified that not only inhibit SARS-CoV-2 entry by targeting spike and hACE2 proteins, but also serve as diagnostic probes for real-time monitoring. Under optimized conditions, significant inhibition of virus infection was validated in both Anti-spike peptide-treated pseudovirus and Anti-hACE2 peptide-treated hACE2 cells, with a synergistic score of 17.092. Cross-variant efficacy extended to the Omicron JN.1 lineage using a newly constructed JN.1-SmBiT pseudovirus, with molecular docking supporting binding at conserved residues. LgBiT-hACE2 transgenic mice and noninvasive bioluminescence imaging verified in vivo suppression and demonstrated enhanced inhibition with combined treatment. This programmable peptide-NanoBiT framework provided multifunctional compounds that integrate therapeutic efficacy with diagnostic capability. Importantly, the modular design highlights its adaptability to other virus-receptor interactions to underscore its potential in pandemic preparedness.",

Dissecting complex crosstalk between autophagy and apoptosis requires simultaneous detection of both events at a single cell level with good temporal resolution in real-time. Here, we have used two distinct fluorescent-based probes of caspase activation and autophagy for generating such sensor cells. Cells stably expressing RFP-LC3 as an autophagy marker were further stably expressed with a FRET-based probe for caspase activation with a nuclear localization signal. The functional validation and live-cell imaging of the sensor cells using selected treatments revealed that stress that induces rapid cell death often fails to induce autophagy signaling, and slow cell death induction triggers simultaneous autophagy signaling with caspase activation. The real-time imaging revealed the time-dependent shift of cells towards caspase activation while autophagy is inhibited confirming basal autophagy confers survival against apoptosis under stress conditions. Confocal imaging also revealed that cells under 3D culture condition maintain increased autophagy over monolayer cultures.

In PPI analysis, methods using the sensor chips are widely employed to obtain quantitative data. However, these methods require that the target proteins be immobilized on the sensor chips, and the immobilization processes can affect the binding of the target proteins to their binding partners. In the present work, we propose a PPI analysis system in which the surface of the living cells is utilized as a sensing platform. In our approach, the target protein is displayed on the cell surface by expressing it as a fusion protein with a membrane protein, and the PPI analysis is then conducted by applying its binding partner labeled with a fluorescent dye to the cell surface. We have constructed a model of this binding analysis system using the interaction between biotin protein ligase (BPL) and biotin carboxyl carrier protein (BCCP), where BCCP was displayed on the cell surface and BPL labeled with fluorescein was applied to the cell surface. Here, a red fluorescent protein, mApple, was attached to the C-terminus of the fusion protein of BCCP with a membrane protein. We evaluated the binding level of the labeled BPL by using the intensity ratios of fluorescence from fluorescein to that from mApple. We found that the binding level of the labeled BPL was stably evaluated at least across 60 min observation period and estimated the binding dissociation constant between BPL and BCCP by equilibrium analysis to be 0.33 ± 0.05 μM.",

We also provide proof-of-concept evidence that HIPSer can monitor IP6 levels in real time in HEK293T cells and can be targeted for IP6 detection in the nucleus of HEK293T cells. Moreover, HIPSer could also detect changes in IP6 content induced by chemical inhibition of IP6-metabolizing enzymes in HEK293T cells. Thus, HIPSer achieves spatiotemporally precise detection of fluctuations in endogenous IP6 in live cells and provides a versatile tool for mechanistic investigations of inositol phosphate functions in metabolism and signaling.",

The genetically encoded sensor, GRAB<sub>eCB2.0</sub>, detects real-time changes in eCB levels in cells in culture and preclinical model systems; however, its activation by eCB analogues produced by cells and by phyto-CBs remains uncharacterized, a current limitation when interpreting changes in its response. This information could provide additional utility for the tool in <i>in vivo</i> pharmacology studies of phyto-CB action. <b>Materials and Methods:</b> GRAB<sub>eCB2.0</sub> was expressed in cultured HEK293 cells. Live cell confocal microscopy and high-throughput fluorescent signal measurements. <b>Results:</b> 2-AG increased GRAB<sub>eCB2.0</sub> fluorescent signal (EC<sub>50</sub>=85 nM), and the cannabinoid 1 receptor (CB<sub>1</sub>R) antagonist, SR141716 (SR1), decreased GRAB<sub>eCB2.0</sub> signal (IC<sub>50</sub>=3.3 nM), responses that mirror their known potencies at the CB<sub>1</sub>R. GRAB<sub>eCB2.0</sub> fluorescent signal also increased in response to AEA (EC<sub>50</sub>=815 nM), the eCB analogues 2-linoleoylglycerol and 2-oleoylglycerol (EC<sub>50</sub>=632 and 868 nM, respectively), Δ<sup>9</sup>-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ<sup>9</sup>-THC), and Δ<sup>8</sup>-THC (EC<sub>50</sub>=1.6 and 2.0 μM, respectively), and the artificial CB<sub>1</sub>R agonist, CP55,940 (CP; EC<sub>50</sub>=82 nM); however their potencies were less than what has been described at CB<sub>1</sub>R. Cannabidiol (CBD) did not affect basal GRAB<sub>eCB2.0</sub> fluorescent signal and yet reduced the 2-AG stimulated GRAB<sub>eCB2.0</sub> responses (IC<sub>50</sub>=9.7 nM). <b>Conclusions:</b> 2-AG and SR1 modulate the GRAB<sub>eCB2.0</sub> fluorescent signal with EC<sub>50</sub> values that mirror their potencies at CB<sub>1</sub>R, whereas AEA, eCB analogues, THC, and CP increase GRAB<sub>eCB2.0</sub> fluorescent signal with EC<sub>50</sub> values significantly lower than their potencies at CB<sub>1</sub>R. CBD reduces the 2-AG response without affecting basal signal, suggesting that GRAB<sub>eCB2.0</sub> retains the negative allosteric modulator (NAM) property of CBD at CB<sub>1</sub>R.

        "abstract": "<i>Histoplasma capsulatum</i> is a dimorphic fungal pathogen acquired via inhalation of soil-resident spores. Upon exposure to mammalian body temperatures, these fungal elements transform into yeasts that reside primarily within phagocytes. Macrophages (MΦ) provide a permissive environment for fungal replication until T cell-dependent immunity is engaged. MΦ activated by granulocyte-MΦ colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) induce metallothioneins (MTs) that bind zinc (Zn) and deprive yeast cells of labile Zn, thereby disabling fungal growth. Prior work demonstrated that the high affinity zinc importer, ZRT2, was important for fungal survival in vivo. Hence, we constructed a yeast cell reporter strain that expresses green fluorescent protein (GFP) under the control of this importer. This reporter accurately responds to medium devoid of Zn. ZRT2 expression increased (∼5-fold) in GM-CSF, but not interferon-γ, stimulated MΦ. To examine the in vivo response, we infected mice with reporter yeasts and assessed ZRT2 expression at 0-, 3-, 7-, and 14-days post-infection (dpi). ZRT2 expression minimally increased at 3-dpi and peaked on 7-dpi, corresponding with onset of adaptive immunity. We discovered that the major phagocyte populations that restrict Zn to the fungus are interstitial MΦ and exudate MΦ. Neutralizing GM-CSF blunted control of infection but unexpectedly increased ZRT2 expression. This increase was dependent on another cytokine that activates MΦ to control <i>H. capsulatum</i> replication, M-CSF. These findings illustrate the reporter's ability to sense Zn <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> and correlate ZRT2 activity with GM-CSF and M-CSF activation of MΦ. Phagocytes use an arsenal of defenses to control replication of <i>Histoplasma</i> yeasts, one of which is limitation of trace metals. On the other hand, <i>H. capsulatum</i> combats metal restriction by upregulating metal importers such as the Zn importer ZRT2. This transporter contributes to <i>H. capsulatum</i> pathogenesis upon activation of adaptive immunity. We constructed a fluorescent ZRT2 reporter to probe <i>H. capsulatum</i> Zn sensing during infection and exposed a role for M-CSF activation of macrophages when GM-CSF is absent. These data highlight the ways in which fungal pathogens sense metal deprivation in vivo and reveal the potential of metal-sensing reporters. The work adds a new dimension to studying how intracellular pathogens sense and respond to the changing environments of the host.",

RNA-based aptamers can bind to nonfluorescent small molecules to activate their fluorescence. However, their performance as reporters of gene expression in living cells has not been fully characterized, unlike protein-based reporters.

Using flow cytometry, we compare the variability at the single-cell level caused by the RNA fluorescent reporters and protein-based reporters. We found that the expression of RNA light-up aptamers produced higher variability in a population than that of their protein counterpart. Finally, we compare the dynamical behavior of these RNA light-up aptamers and protein-based reporters.

Opioid analgesics altered dopamine negative responses to aversive stimuli toward more positive responses, while excitatory responses of glutamate inputs remained unchanged.

Conventional measurement of micronutrients is often complex, laboratory-based, and not suitable for monitoring their bioavailable concentration. To address this need, we developed a fluorescence based microbial whole-cell biosensing (MWCB) system encoding for a Cu<sup>2+</sup>-responsive protein capable of generating a signal upon binding to Cu<sup>2+</sup>. The sensing-reporting protein was designed by performing circular permutation on the green fluorescent protein (GFP) followed by insertion of a Cu<sup>2+</sup> binding motif into the structure of GFP. The design included insertion of several binding motifs and creating plasmids that encoded the corresponding sensing proteins. The signal generated by the sensing-reporting protein is directly proportional to the concentration of Cu<sup>2+</sup> in the sample. Evaluation of the resulting biosensing systems carrying these plasmids was performed prior to selection of the optimal fluorescence emitting Cu<sup>2+</sup>-binding protein. The resulting optimized biosensing system was encapsulated in polyacrylate-alginate beads and embedded in soil for detection of the analyte. Once exposed to the soil, the beads were interrogated to measure the fluorescence signal emitted by the sensing-reporting protein using a portable imaging device. The biosensor was optimized for detection of Cu<sup>2+</sup> in terms of selectivity, sensitivity, matrix effects, detection limits, and reproducibility in both liquid and soil matrices. The limit of detection (LoD) of the optimized encapsulated biosensor was calculated as 0.27 mg/L and 1.26 mg/kg of Cu<sup>2+</sup> for Cu<sup>2+</sup> in solution and soil, respectively. Validation of the portable imaging tools as a potential biosensing device in the field was performed.",

Here, we developed bioluminescent reporter bacteriophages for viable Cs-specific, substrate-free, rapid detection by introducing luciferase and its corresponding substrate-providing enzyme complex into the virulent phage ΦC01. Although the reporter phage ΦC01_lux, constructed by replacing non-essential genes for phage infectivity with a luxCDABE reporter operon, produced bioluminescence upon Cs infection, the emitted signal was quickly decayed due to the superior bacteriolytic activity of ΦC01. By truncating the membrane pore-forming protein holin and thus limiting its function, the bacterial lysis was delayed and the resultant engineered reporter phage ΦC01_lux_Δhol could produce a more stable and reliable bioluminescent signal. Accordingly, ΦC01_lux_Δhol was able to detect at least an average of 2 CFU/ml of Cs artificially contaminated PIF and Sunsik and food contact surface models within a total of 7 h of assays, including 5 h of pre-enrichment for Cs amplification.

Dynamic visualization of histone modifications with genetically encoded fluorescent sensors makes it possible to monitor changes in the epigenetic state of a single living cell.

Thus, prolonged binding of the sensors to chromatin can affect normal epigenetic regulation. Here, we report an optogenetic sensor for live-cell visualization of histone H3 methylated at lysine-9 (H3K9me3) named MPP8-LAMS (MPP8-based light-activated modification sensor). MPP8-LAMS consists of several fusion protein parts (from N- to C-terminus): i) nuclear export signal (NES), ii) far-red fluorescent protein Katushka, iii) H3K9me3-binding reader domain of the human M phase phosphoprotein 8 (MPP8), iv) the light-responsive AsLOV2 domain, which exposes a nuclear localization signal (NLS) upon blue light stimulation. In the dark, due to the NES, MPP8-LAMS is localized in the cytosol. Under blue light illumination, MPP8-LAMS underwent an efficient translocation from cytosol to nucleus, enabling visualization of H3K9me3-enriched loci. Such an on-demand visualization minimizes potential impact on cell physiology as most of the time the sensor is separated from its target.

Tryptophan metabolism is emerging as a critical hub for metabolic regulation of immune responses and neural activities through the kynurenine and serotonin pathways1,2. Metabolic reprogramming of tryptophan dynamics is highly associated with inflammation3, which plays important roles in neurological and cardiovascular diseases, ageing, and cancers1,2,4,5. Invasive approaches, such as high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and genetically encoded fluorescence resonance energy transfer nanosensors (FLIPWs) have been developed to measure tryptophan concentrations6,7. However, these methods are either time-consuming or limited by detection range and photobleaching effect8, making them unsuitable for detecting intracellular and extracellular tryptophan dynamics in vivo. As a result, we lack a viable approach for quantitative and systemic measurement of tryptophan metabolism in vivo. In this study, we fused a circularly permuted superfolder YFP9,10 into every insertion site of the flexible loop (site 64–69) of bacterial tryptophan repressor protein TrpR11, where has a large conformational change upon tryptophan binding. We then performed linker truncations and screened a biosensor with ~1.5-fold fluorescence responses to tryptophan. Semi-rational design was conducted by focusing on the residues close to the chromophore or linkers, yielding a mutant with ~6-fold response.

The approach is exemplified for the biotechnologically relevant macrolide rapamycin, for which we first construct an intensiometric rapamycin detector (iRapTor) while comprehensively probing key design principles in the iRapTor scaffold. Specifically, this includes the scope of minimal copolymeric linkers as a function of topology and the concomitant need for gate post residues. In a subsequent step, we apply iRapTors to assess the permeability of the <i>E. coli</i> cell envelope to rapamycin.

The ability to monitor the amount and localization of endogenous RNAs in living cells allows for elucidating the mechanisms of various intracellular events. Protein-based fluorescent RNA probes are now widely used to visualize and analyze RNAs in living cells. However, continuously monitoring the temporal changes in RNA localization and dynamics in living cells is challenging. In this study, we developed a bioluminescent probe for spatiotemporal monitoring of RNAs in living cells by using a split-luciferase reconstitution technique. The probe consists of split fragments of a bioluminescent protein, NanoLuc, connected with RNA-binding protein domains generated from a custom-made mutation of a PUM-HD. The probe showed rapid luminescence intensity changes in response to an increase or decrease in the amount of a target RNA <i>in vitro</i>. In live-cell imaging, temporal alteration of the intracellular distribution of endogenous β-actin mRNA was visualized in response to extracellular stimulation. Furthermore, the application of the probe to the visualization of the specific localization of β-actin mRNA in primary hippocampal neurons was conducted. These results demonstrate the capability of the bioluminescent RNA probe to monitor the changes in localization, dynamics, and the amount of target RNA in living cells.",

Here, we engineer a highly sensitive accessible cholesterol biosensor by taking advantage of the cholesterol-sensing element (the GRAM domain) of an evolutionarily conserved lipid transfer protein, GRAMD1b.

Ultratrace mercury is a potential threat to human health via the food chain. Here, we developed an ultrasensitive mercury WCB by directed evolution of the mercury-responsive transcriptional activator (MerR) sensing module to detect ultratrace mercury. Subsequently, the mutant WCB (m4-1) responding to mercury in the parts per trillion range after 1 h of induction was obtained. Its detection limit (LOD) was 0.313 ng/L, comparable to those of some analytical instruments. Surprisingly, the m4-1 WCB also responded to methylmercury (LOD = 98 ng/L), which is far more toxic than inorganic mercury. For more convenient detection, we have increased another green fluorescent protein reporter module with an optimized 5' untranslated region (5' UTR) sequence. This yields two visual WCBs with an enhanced fluorescence output. At a concentration of 2.5 ng/L, the fluorescence signals can be directly observed by the naked eye. With the combination of mobile phone imaging and image processing software, the 2GC WCB provided simple, rapid, and reliable quantitative and qualitative analysis of real samples (LOD = 0.307 ng/L).

We used zebrafish as a model of infection for Aeromonas salmonicida subsp. salmonicida (hereinafter A. salmonicida), the causative agent of fish furunculosis. The infection process of A. salmonicida was studied by immersion of zebrafish larvae in 2 different doses of the bacteria and the fish mortality was monitored for three days. The bacterium caused a high mortality (65 %) in zebrafish larvae only when they were exposed to a high bacterial concentration (10<sup>7</sup> bacterial cells/mL). To evaluate the use of fluorescence microscopy to follow A. salmonicida infection in vivo, two different fluorescent strains generated by labeling an A. salmonicida strain with either, the green fluorescent protein (GFP), or with a previously reported siderophore amonabactin-sulforhodamine B conjugate (AMB-SRB), were used. The distribution of both labeled bacterial strains in the larvae tissues was evaluated by conventional and confocal fluorescence microscopy. The fluorescent signal showed a greater intensity with the GFP-labeled bacteria, so it could be observed using conventional fluorescence microscopy. Since the AMB-SRB labeled bacteria showed a weaker signal, the larvae were imaged using a laser scanning confocal microscope after 48 h of exposure to the bacteria. Both fluorescent signals were mainly observed in the larvae digestive tract, suggesting that this is the main colonization route of zebrafish for waterborne A. salmonicida.

Sensitive detection of METTL3/14 complex is essential to tumor pathogenesis study, cancer diagnosis, and anti-cancer drug discovery. However, traditional methods for METTL3/14 complex assay suffer from poor specificity, costly antibodies, unstable RNA substrates, and low sensitivity. Herein, we construct a single quantum dot (QD)-based förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) biosensor for sensitive detection of METTL3/14 complex activity. In the presence of METTL3/14 complex, it catalyzes the methylation of adenine in the substrate probe, leading to the formation of m<sup>6</sup>A that protects the substrate probes from MazF-mediated cleavage. The hybridization of methylated DNA substrate with biotinylated capture probe initiates polymerization reaction to obtain a biotinylated double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) with the incorporation of numerous Cy5 fluorophores. Subsequently, the Cy5-incorporated dsDNA can self-assembly onto the 605QD surface to form the 605QD-dsDNA-Cy5 nanostructure, causing FRET between 605QD donor and Cy5 acceptor. This biosensor has excellent sensitivity with a limit of detection (LOD) of 3.11 × 10<sup>-17</sup> M, and it can measure the METTL3/14 complex activity in a single cell. Moreover, this biosensor can be used to evaluate the METTL3/14 complex kinetic parameters and screen potential inhibitors.

To compare odor coding in sensory neurons, we analyzed the antennal lobe (AL) structure, generated glomerular atlases, and developed GCaMP transgenic lines for all species. Although subsets of glomeruli showed distinct tuning profiles, odorants inducing species-specific preferences were coded generally similarly. Species distantly related or occupying different habitats showed more evident differences in odor coding, and further analysis revealed that changes in olfactory receptor (OR) sequences partially explain these differences. Our results demonstrate that genetic distance in phylogeny and ecological niche occupancy are key determinants in the evolution of ORs, AL structures, odor coding, and behavior. Interestingly, changes in odor coding among species could not be explained by evolutionary changes at a single olfactory processing level but rather are a complex phenomenon based on changes at multiple levels.",

The activation of Cytc is composed of several steps, including its transfer to the mitochondrial membrane, binding to cytochrome c heme lyase (CCHL) and covalent attachment to heme. The spectroscopic methods are often applied to study the structural changes of Cytc. However, they require the isolation of Cytc from cells and have limited availability under physiological conditions. Despite recent studies to elucidate the tightly regulated folding mechanism of Cytc, the role of these events and their association with different conformational states remain elusive. Here, we provide a genetically encoded fluorescence method that allows monitoring of the conformational changes of Cytc upon binding to heme and CCHL. Cerulean and Venus fluorescent proteins attached at the N and C terminals of Cytc can be used to determine its unfolded, intermediate, and native states by measuring FRET amplitude. We found that the noncovalent interaction of heme in the absence of CCHL induced a shift in the FRET signal, indicating the formation of a partially folded state. The higher concentration of heme and coexpression of CCHL gave rise to the recovery of Cytc native structure. We also found that Cytc was weakly associated with CCHL in the absence of heme. As a result, a FRET-based fluorescence approach was demonstrated to elucidate the mechanism of heme-induced Cytc conformational changes with spatiotemporal resolution and can be applied to study its interaction with small molecules and other protein partners in living cells.",

Therapies to treat FSGS are limited, and podocyte-specific drugs are unavailable. To address the need for treatments to delay or stop FSGS progression, researchers are exploring the repurposing of drugs that have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for other purposes. To identify drugs with potential to treat FSGS, we used a specific zebrafish screening strain to combine a high-content screening (HCS) approach with an in vivo model. This zebrafish screening strain expresses nitroreductase and the red fluorescent protein mCherry exclusively in podocytes (providing an indicator for podocyte depletion), as well as a circulating 78 kDa vitamin D-binding enhanced green fluorescent protein fusion protein (as a readout for proteinuria). To produce FSGS-like lesions in the zebrafish, we added 80 µ M metronidazole into the fish water. We used a specific screening microscope in conjunction with advanced image analysis methods to screen a library of 138 drugs and compounds (including some FDA-approved drugs) for podocyte-protective effects. Promising candidates were validated to be suitable for translational studies. After establishing this novel in vivo HCS assay, we identified seven drugs or compounds that were protective in our FSGS-like model. Validation experiments confirmed that the FDA-approved drug belinostat was protective against larval FSGS. Similar pan-histone deacetylase inhibitors also showed potential to reproduce this effect. Using an FSGS-like zebrafish model, we developed a novel in vivo HCS assay that identified belinostat and related pan-histone deacetylase inhibitors as potential candidates for treating FSGS.",

Exposure to membrane, osmotic or oxidative stress generated both specific changes in single cell intracellular calcium spiking and longer calcium transients across the population. Repeated treatments showed that calcium dynamics become unaffected by some stresses but not others, consistent with known cell adaptation mechanisms. By expressing GCaMP in mutant strains and tracking the viability of individual cells over time, the relative contributions of key signaling pathways to calcium flux, stress adaptation, and cell death were demonstrated.

Lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup>-channels are a major Ca<sup>2+</sup> source driving particle uptake in macrophages, but different channels drive different aspects of Fc-receptor-mediated phagocytosis: TPC2 couples to dynamin activation, whilst TRPML1 couples to lysosomal exocytosis. We hypothesised that they are driven by discrete local plumes of Ca<sup>2+</sup> around open channels (Ca<sup>2+</sup> nanodomains). To test this, we optimized Ca<sup>2+</sup>-nanodomain recordings by screening panels of genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicators (GECIs) fused to TPC2 to monitor the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] next to the channel. Signal calibration accounting for the distance of the GECI from the channel mouth reveals that, during phagocytosis, TPC2 generates local Ca<sup>2+</sup> nanodomains around itself of up to 42 µM, nearly a hundred-fold greater than the global cytosolic [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] rise.

Noninactivating currents from the Orai1 Y80E mutant provided a steady flux of Ca<sup>2+</sup> controlled on a millisecond time scale by step changes in membrane potential. Test pulses to -100 mV produced Orai1 Y80E-jGCaMP8f fluorescence traces that unexpectedly declined by ~50% over 100 ms before reaching a stable plateau. Testing of Orai1-jGCaMP8f using unroofed cells further demonstrated that rapid and partial fluorescence inactivation is a property of the indicator itself, rather than channel function. Photoinactivation spontaneously recovered over 5 min in the dark, and recovery was accelerated in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Mutational analysis of residues near the tripeptide fluorophore of jGCaMP8f pointed to a mechanism: Q69M/C70V greatly increased (~90%) photoinactivation, reminiscent of fluorescent protein fluorophore cis-trans photoswitching. Indeed, 405-nm illumination of jGCaMP8f or 8m/8s/6f led to immediate photorecovery, and simultaneous illumination with 405 and 488-nm light blocked photoinactivation.

Bioluminescent reporter mice harboring luciferases for general use have been limited to a classical luciferase, Luc2, from Photinus pyralis, and have been extremely powerful for various in vivo studies. However, applicability of reporter mice for in vivo BLI could be further accelerated by increasing light intensity through the use of other luciferases and/or by improving the biodistribution of their substrates in the animal body. Here we created two Cre-dependent reporter mice incorporating luciferases oFluc derived from Pyrocoeli matsumurai and Akaluc, both of which had been reported previously to be brighter than Luc2 when using appropriate substrates; we then tested their bioluminescence in neural tissues and other organs in living mice. When expressed throughout the body, both luciferases emitted an intense yellow (oFluc) or far-red (Akaluc) light easily visible to the naked eye. oFluc and Akaluc were similarly bright in the pancreas for in vivo BLI; however, Akaluc was superior to oFluc for brain imaging, because its substrate, AkaLumine-HCl, was distributed to the brain more efficiently than the oFluc substrate, D-luciferin. We also demonstrated that the lights produced by oFluc and Akaluc were sufficiently spectrally distinct from each other for dual-color imaging in a single living mouse.

        "abstract": "Individuals who have experienced mild traumatic brain injuries (mTBIs) suffer from several comorbidities, including chronic pain. Despite extensive studies investigating the underlying mechanisms of mTBI-associated chronic pain, the role of inflammation in long-term pain after mTBIs is not fully elucidated. Given the shifting dynamics of inflammation, it is important to understand the spatial-longitudinal changes in inflammatory processes following mTBIs and their effects on TBI-related pain. We utilized a recently developed transgenic caspase-1 luciferase reporter mouse model to monitor caspase-1 activation through a thinned skull window in the in vivo setting following three closed-head mTBI events. Organotypic coronal brain slice cultures and acutely dissociated dorsal root ganglion (DRG) cells provided tissue-relevant context of inflammation signal. Mechanical allodynia was assessed by mechanical withdrawal threshold to von Frey and thermal hyperalgesia withdrawal latency to radiant heat. Mouse grimace scale (MGS) was used to detect spontaneous or non-evoked pain. In some experiments, mice were prophylactically treated with MCC950, a potent small molecule inhibitor of NLRP3 inflammasome assembly to inhibit injury-induced inflammatory signaling. Bioluminescence spatiotemporal dynamics were quantified in the head and hind paws, and caspase-1 activation was confirmed by immunoblot. Immunofluorescence staining was used to monitor the progression of astrogliosis and microglial activation in ex vivo brain tissue following repetitive closed-head mTBIs. Mice with repetitive closed-head mTBIs exhibited significant increases of the bioluminescence signals within the brain and paws in vivo for at least one week after each injury. Consistently, immunoblotting and immunofluorescence experiments confirmed that mTBIs led to caspase-1 activation, astrogliosis, and microgliosis. Persistent changes in MGS and hind paw withdrawal thresholds, indicative of pain states, were observed post-injury in the same mTBI animals in vivo. We also observed enhanced inflammatory responses in ex vivo brain slice preparations and DRG for at least 3 days following mTBIs. In vivo treatment with MCC950 significantly reduced caspase-1 activation-associated bioluminescent signals in vivo and decreased stimulus-evoked and non-stimulus evoked nociception. Our findings suggest that the inflammatory states in the brain and peripheral nervous system following repeated mTBIs are coincidental with the development of nociceptive sensitization, and that these events can be significantly reduced by inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome activation.",

To help bridge these knowledge gaps, we developed the first ever recombinant strain of CyHV-2 expressing bioluminescent and fluorescent reporter genes. Infection of <i>Carassius auratus</i> hosts with this recombinant by immersion facilitated the exploitation of various in vivo imaging techniques to establish the spatiotemporal aspects of CyHV-2 replication at larval, juvenile, and adult developmental stages. While less susceptible than later developmental stages, larvae were most permissive to CyHV-2 replication, leading to rapid systemic infection and high mortality. Permissivity to CyHV-2 decreased with advancing development, with adults being the least permissive and, thus, also exhibiting the least mortality. Across all developmental stages, the skin was the most susceptible and permissive organ to infection at the earliest sampling points post-infection, indicating that it represents the major portal of entry into these hosts.

        "abstract": "Ca<sup>2+</sup> leak from cardiomyocyte sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) via hyperactive resting cardiac ryanodine receptor channels (RyR2) is pro-arrhythmic. An exogenous peptide (DPc10) binding promotes leaky RyR2 in cardiomyocytes and reports on that endogenous state. Conversely, calmodulin (CaM) binding inhibits RyR2 leak and low CaM affinity is diagnostic of leaky RyR2. These observations have led to designing a FRET biosensor for drug discovery targeting RyR2. We used FRET to clarify the molecular mechanism driving the DPc10-CaM interdependence when binding RyR2 in SR vesicles. We used donor-FKBP12.6 (D-FKBP) to resolve RyR2 binding of acceptor-CaM (A-CaM). In low nanomolar Ca<sup>2+</sup>, DPc10 decreased both FRET<sub>max</sub> (under saturating [A-CaM]) and the CaM/RyR2 binding affinity. In micromolar Ca<sup>2+</sup>, DPc10 decreased FRET<sub>max</sub> without affecting CaM/RyR2 binding affinity. This correlates with the analysis of fluorescence-lifetime-detected FRET, indicating that DPc10 lowers occupancy of the RyR2 CaM-binding sites in nanomolar (not micromolar) Ca<sup>2+</sup> and lengthens D-FKBP/A-CaM distances independent of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]. To observe DPc10/RyR2 binding, we used acceptor-DPc10 (A-DPc10). CaM weakens A-DPc10/RyR2 binding, with this effect being larger in micromolar versus nanomolar Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Moreover, A-DPc10/RyR2 binding is cooperative in a CaM- and FKBP-dependent manner, suggesting that both endogenous modulators promote concerted structural changes between RyR2 protomers for channel regulation. Aided by the analysis of cryo-EM structures, these insights inform further development of the DPc10-CaM paradigm for therapeutic discovery targeting RyR2.",

GPCR activation primarily initiates heterotrimeric G protein signaling. To detect ligand-induced G protein activation, Bioluminescence Resonance Energy Transfer (BRET)-based biosensors were previously developed. Here, we designed a novel set of Nanoluciferase (NLuc) BRET-based biosensors (REGA-SIGN) that covers all Gα protein families (i.e., Gα<sub>i/o</sub>, Gα<sub>Ss/L</sub>, Gα<sub>12/13</sub> and Gα<sub>q/15</sub>). REGA-SIGN uses NLuc as a bioluminescent donor and LSS-mKATE2, a red-shifted fluorophore, as an acceptor. Due to the enhanced spectral separation between donor and acceptor emission and the availability of a stable substrate for NLuc, this donor-acceptor pair enables sensitive kinetic assessment of G protein activity. After optimization, the NLuc integration sites into the Gα subunit largely corresponded with previously reported integration sites, except for Gα<sub>Ss/L</sub> for which we describe an alternative NLuc insertion site. G protein rescue experiments validated the biological activity of these Gα donor proteins. Direct comparison between EGFP and LSS-mKATE2 as acceptor fluorophores revealed improved sensitivity for nearly all G protein subtypes when using the latter one. Hence, REGA-SIGN can be used as a panel of kinetic G protein biosensors with high sensitivity.",

Such dysregulation may lead to oxidative damage when combined with oxidative stress overpassing the cell capacity to detoxify ROS. In this work, a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2)-regulated sulfiredoxin reporter (Srxn1-GFP) was used to measure the antioxidant response of HepG2 cells to a large series of drug and drug-like compounds (2230 compounds). These compounds were then classified as positive or negative depending on cellular response and distributed among different modeling groups to establish structure-activity relationship (SAR) models. A selection of models was used to prospectively predict oxidative stress induced by a new set of compounds subsequently experimentally tested to validate the model predictions.

Whole-cell microbial sensors (WCMSs) can use normal strains to simulate the metabolic environment, achieving safe, sensitive, and high-throughput detection and evaluation for GTIs. Here, based on whether GTIs causing DNA alkylation required metabolic enzymes or not, two DNA repair-responsive engineered WCMS systems were constructed including <i>Escherichia coli</i>-WCMS and yeast-WCMS. A DNA repair-responsive promoter as a sensing element was coupled with an enhanced green fluorescent protein as a reporter to construct plasmids for introduction into WCMS.

Different <i>E. coli</i> and yeast strains were modified by gene knockout and mutation to eliminate the interference and enhance the GTI retention in cells and further improved the sensitivity. Finally, GTI consumption of WCMS for the evaluation of methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) and nitrosamines was decreased to 0.46-8.53 μg and 0.068 ng-2.65 μg, respectively, decreasing 2-3 orders of magnitude compared to traditional methods.

However, most existing DNA-based probes rely on fluorescence as the signal output, which can be problematic due to issues like autofluorescence and scattering when applied in complex biological materials such as living cells or tissues. Herein, we report the development of bioluminescent nucleic acid (bioLUNA) sensors that offer laser excitation-independent and ratiometric imaging of the target in vivo. The system is based on computational modelling and mutagenesis investigations of a genetic fusion between circular permutated Nano-luciferase (NLuc) and HaloTag, enabling the conjugation of the protein with a DNAzyme. In the presence of Zn<sup>2+</sup> , the DNAzyme sensor releases the fluorophore-labelled strand, leading to a reduction in bioluminescent resonance energy transfer (BRET) between the luciferase and fluorophore. Consequently, this process induces ratiometric changes in the bioluminescent signal. We demonstrated that this bioLUNA sensor enabled imaging of both exogenous Zn<sup>2+</sup> in vivo and endogenous Zn<sup>2+</sup> efflux in normal epithelial prostate and prostate tumors. This work expands the DNAzyme sensors to using bioluminescence and thus has enriched the toolbox of nucleic acid sensors for a broad range of biomedical applications.",

To overcome this challenge, we make two advances: first, we introduce a genetic line of mice for Cre-dependent co-expression of a calcium indicator and a potent soma-targeted microbial opsin. Second, using this line, we develop a method for read-out and write-in of precise population vectors of neural activity by calibrating the photostimulation to each cell.

Ethanol-induced plasticity and neuroadaptations predominantly occur in striatal direct pathway projecting medium spiny neurons (dMSNs). It is hypothesized that alterations in eCB neuromodulation may be involved. Recent work has implicated a role of eCB 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) in the rewarding effects of ethanol. However, there is insufficient research to answer which cellular subtype is responsible for mediating the 2-AG eCB signal that might be involved in the rewarding properties of ethanol and the mechanisms by which that occurs. To examine the role of dMSN mediated 2-AG signaling in ethanol related synaptic transmission and behaviors, we used conditional knockout mice in which the 2-AG-synthesizing enzyme diacylglycerol lipase α (DGLα) was deleted in dMSNs, DGLα<sup>D1-Cre+</sup>. Using acute brain slice photometry and a genetically encoded fluorescent eCB sensor, GRAB<sub>eCB2.0,</sub> to assess real-time eCB mediated activity of sensorimotor inputs from primary motor cortices (M1/M2) to the dorsolateral striatum, we showed that DGLα<sup>D1-Cre+</sup> mice had blunted evoked eCB-mediated presynaptic eCB signaling compared to littermate controls. Furthermore, ethanol induced eCB inhibition was significantly reduced in DGLα<sup>D1-Cre+</sup> deficient mice. Additionally, there was a reduction in the duration of loss of righting reflex (LORR) to a high dose of ethanol in the DGLα<sup>D1-Cre+</sup> mice compared to controls. These mice also showed a male-specific decrease in ethanol preference accompanied by an increase in ethanol-induced water consumption in a voluntary drinking paradigm. There were no significant differences observed in sucrose and quinine consumption between the genotypes. These findings reveal a novel role for dMSN mediated 2-AG signaling in modulating ethanol effects on presynaptic function and behavior.",

        "abstract": "Synaptic plasticity is a fundamental feature of the CNS that controls the magnitude of signal transmission between communicating cells. Many electrical synapses exhibit substantial plasticity that modulates the degree of coupling within groups of neurons, alters the fidelity of signal transmission, or even reconfigures functional circuits. In several known examples, such plasticity depends on calcium and is associated with neuronal activity. Calcium-driven signaling is known to promote potentiation of electrical synapses in fish Mauthner cells, mammalian retinal AII amacrine cells, and inferior olive neurons, and to promote depression in thalamic reticular neurons. To measure local calcium dynamics <i>in situ</i>, we developed a transgenic mouse expressing a GCaMP calcium biosensor fused to Connexin 36 (Cx36) at electrical synapses. We examined the sources of calcium for activity-dependent plasticity in retina slices using confocal or Super-Resolution Radial Fluctuations imaging. More than half of Cx36-GCaMP gap junctions responded to puffs of glutamate with transient increases in fluorescence. The responses were strongly dependent on NMDA receptors, in keeping with known activity-dependent signaling in some amacrine cells. We also found that some responses depended on the activity of voltage-gated calcium channels, representing a previously unrecognized source of calcium to control retinal electrical synaptic plasticity. The high prevalence of calcium signals at electrical synapses in response to glutamate application indicates that a large fraction of electrical synapses has the potential to be regulated by neuronal activity. This provides a means to tune circuit connectivity dynamically based on local activity.",

The phylogenetic analysis showed that the new ALucs formed an independent branch that was genetically isolated from other natural marine luciferases. The new ALucs successfully survived and luminesced with native coelenterazine (nCTZ) and its analogs in living mammalian cells. The results showed that the bioluminescence (BL) intensities of the ALucs were interestingly proportional to the length of the appended peptide blocks. The computational modeling revealed that the appended peptide blocks created a flexible region near the active site, potentially modulating the enzymatic activities. The new ALucs generated various colors with maximally approximately 90 nm redshifted BL spectra in orange upon reaction with the authors' previously reported <b>1</b>- and <b>2</b>-series coelenterazine analogs.

By tuning the number of hydroxyl groups, we optimize the selectivity of fluorescent protein chromophores toward aggregated proteins in these biological samples. In recombinant protein applications, the most hydrophobic P0 (cLogP = 5.28) offers the highest fold change (FC = 31.6), sensitivity (LLOD = 0.1 μM), and brightness (Φ = 0.20) upon binding to aggregated proteins. In contrast, P4 of balanced amphiphilicity (cLogP = 2.32) is required for selective detection of proteome stresses in live cells. In mouse and human liver histology tissues, hydrophobic P1 exhibits the best performance in staining the aggregated proteome. Overall, the amphiphilicity of fluorescent chromophores governs the sensor's performance by matching the diverse nature of different biological samples.

The SCN is composed of two major peptidergic neuron types in the core and shell regions of the SCN. Determining how mRGCs interact with the network of synaptic connections onto and between SCN neurons is key to understand how light regulates the circadian clock and to elucidate the relevant local circuits within the SCN. To map these connections, we used a newly developed Cre-dependent electron microscopy (EM) reporter, APEX2, to label the mitochondria of mRGC axons. Serial blockface scanning electron microscopy was then used to resolve the fine 3D structure of mRGC axons and synaptic boutons in the SCN of a male mouse. The resulting maps reveal patterns of connectomic organization in the core and shell of the SCN. We show that these regions are composed of different neuronal subtypes and differ with regard to the pattern of mRGC input, as the shell receives denser mRGC synaptic input compared with the core. This finding challenges the present view that photic information coming directly from the retina is received primarily by the core region of the SCN.",

Particularly, the pathogenesis of a few diseases including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is closely related to high ATP concentrations. A bioluminescent D-luciferin/luciferase system, which includes a luciferase (FLuc) from the firefly <i>Photinus pyralis</i> as a key component, is the most commonly used method for the detection and quantification of ATP. Here, instead of isolating FLuc produced in recombinant <i>Escherichia coli</i>, we aimed to develop a whole-cell biocatalyst system that does not require extraction and purification of FLuc. To this end, the gene coding for FLuc was introduced into the genome of probiotic <i>Saccharomyces boulardii</i> using the CRISPR/Cas9-based genome editing system. The linear relationship (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.9561) between ATP levels and bioluminescence generated from the engineered <i>S. boulardii</i> expressing FLuc was observed in vitro. To explore the feasibility of using the engineered <i>S. boulardii</i> expressing FLuc as a whole-cell biosensor to detect inflammation biomarker (<i>i.e.</i>, ATP) in the gut, a colitis mouse model was established using dextran sodium sulfate as a colitogenic compound.

In this study, we further explored the dynamics of FGFR2 expression through an enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) reporter mouse line (FGFR2-eGFP). We observed that FGFR2-eGFP is present in the late 8-cell stage; however, it is absent or reduced in the ICM of early blastocysts. We then statistically correlated eGFP expression with PE and EPI markers GATA6 and NANOG, respectively. We detected that eGFP is weakly correlated with GATA6 in early blastocysts, but this correlation quickly increases as the blastocyst develops. The correlation between eGFP and NANOG decreases throughout blastocyst development. Treatment with FGF from the morula stage onwards did not affect FGFR2-eGFP presence in the ICM of early blastocysts; however, late blastocysts presented FGFR2-eGFP in all cells of the ICM. BMP treatment positively influenced FGFR2-eGFP expression and reduced the number of NANOG-positive cells in late blastocysts. In conclusion, FGFR2 is not strongly associated with PE precursors in the early blastocyst, but it is highly correlated with PE cells as blastocyst development progresses, consistent with the proposed role for FGFR2 in maintenance rather than initiating the PE lineage.",

In recent years there has been an increased interest in the generation of genetically engineered CEST contrast agents, typically based on existing proteins with CEST contrast or modified to produce CEST contrast. We have developed an in silico method for the evolution of peptide sequences to optimize CEST contrast and showed that these peptides could be combined to create de novo biosensors for CEST MRI. A single protein, superCESTide, was designed to be 198 amino acids. SuperCESTide was expressed in E. coli and purified with size exclusion chromatography. The magnetic transfer ratio asymmetry generated by superCESTide was comparable to levels seen in previous CEST reporters, such as protamine sulfate (salmon protamine) and human protamine.

This process converted target recognition into an amplified bioluminescence response, enabling smartphone-based quantification of tetracycline and erythromycin directly in milk within 15 min. Moreover, the detection threshold of eBLUE can be easily tuned according to the maximum residue limits (MRLs) established by government agencies. Owing to this tunable nature, the eBLUE was further repurposed as an on-demand semi-quantification platform, allowing for fast (∼20 min) and software-free identification of safe and MRL-exceeding milk samples only by glancing over the smartphone photographs.

While the standard redox potentials of those systems are known, the in vivo \"steady state\" redox potential imposed onto protein thiol disulfide pairs in the periplasm remains unknown. Here, we used genetically encoded redox probes (roGFP2 and roGFP-iL), targeted to the periplasm, to directly probe the thiol redox homeostasis in this compartment. These probes contain two cysteine residues that are virtually completely reduced in the cytoplasm, but once exported into the periplasm, can form a disulfide bond, a process that can be monitored by fluorescence spectroscopy. Even in the absence of DsbA, roGFP2, exported to the periplasm, was almost fully oxidized, suggesting the presence of an alternative system for the introduction of disulfide bonds into exported proteins. However, the absence of DsbA shifted the steady state periplasmic thiol-redox potential from -228 mV to a more reducing -243 mV and the capacity to re-oxidize periplasmic roGFP2 after a reductive pulse was significantly decreased. Re-oxidation in a DsbA strain could be fully restored by exogenous oxidized glutathione (GSSG), while reduced GSH accelerated re-oxidation of roGFP2 in the WT. In line, a strain devoid of endogenous glutathione showed a more reducing periplasm, and was significantly worse in oxidatively folding PhoA, a native periplasmic protein and substrate of the oxidative folding machinery. PhoA oxidative folding could be enhanced by the addition of exogenous GSSG in the WT and fully restored in a ΔdsbA mutant.

Furthermore, we applied this dual read-out assay to investigate the function of thiamine-sensing riboswitches thiM and thiC from Escherichia coli and the adenine-sensing riboswitch ASW from Vibrio vulnificus and pbuE from Bacillus subtilis, which represent transcriptional and translational on- and off-riboswitches, respectively.

Although flow cytometry and fluorescence imaging techniques have been used to assess autophagic flux, we remain less able to <i>in vivo</i> monitor autophagic flux in a highly sensitive, robust, and well-quantified manner. Here, we reported a new method for real-time and quantitatively monitoring autophagosomes and assessing autophagic flux in living cells based on fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS). In this study, microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3B (LC3B) fused with an enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP-LC3B) was used as a biomarker to label autophagosomes in living cells, and FCS was used to monitor EGFP-LC3B labeled autophagosomes by using the characteristic diffusion time (<i>τ</i><sub>D</sub>) value and brightness per particle (BPP) value. By analyzing the distribution frequency of the <i>τ</i><sub>D</sub> values in living cells stably expressing EGFP-LC3B, mutant EGFP-LC3B (EGFP-LC3BΔG) and enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP), we found that the <i>τ</i><sub>D</sub> value greater than 10 ms was attributed to the signal of EGFP-LC3B labeled autophagosomes. So, we proposed a parameter <i>P</i><sub>AP</sub> as an indicator to assess the basal autophagic activity and induced autophagic flux. This new method was able to evaluate autophagy inducers, early-stage autophagy inhibitors, and late-stage autophagy inhibitors. Compared with current methods, our method shows high spatiotemporal resolution and very high sensitivity for autophagosomes in low EGFP-LC3B expressing cells and will become an attractive and alternative method for biological and medical studies, some drug screening, and disease treatment.",

UDP signals to the microglial P2Y<sub>6</sub> receptor for broad increases in calcium signaling during epileptogenesis. UDP-P2Y<sub>6</sub> signaling is necessary for lysosome upregulation across limbic brain regions and enhances production of pro-inflammatory cytokines-TNFα and IL-1β.

Here, we demonstrate the feasibility of using the monomeric superfolder GFP (msfGFP) exported from <i>S. aureus.</i> By fusing msfGFP to signal peptides for the Secretory (Sec) and Twin Arginine Translocation (Tat) pathways, the two major secretion pathways in <i>S. aureus,</i> we quantified msfGFP fluorescence in bacterial cultures and cell-free supernatant from the cultures. When fused to a Tat signal peptide, we detected msfGFP fluorescence inside but not outside bacterial cells, indicating a failure to export msfGFP. However, when fused to a Sec signal peptide, msfGFP fluorescence was present outside cells, indicating successful export of the msfGFP in the unfolded state, followed by extracellular folding and maturation to the photoactive state. We applied this strategy to study coagulase (Coa), a secreted protein and a major contributor to the formation of a fibrin network in <i>S. aureus</i> biofilms that protects bacteria from the host immune system and increases attachment to host surfaces. We confirmed that a genomically integrated C-terminal fusion of Coa to msfGFP does not impair the activity of Coa or its localisation within the biofilm matrix.

To overcome this limitation, we developed a nanobody-based intermolecular tension FRET biosensor capable of measuring the mechanical strain of lamin filaments. Using this sensor, we were able to show that the nuclear lamina is subjected to significant force. These forces are dependent on nuclear volume, actomyosin contractility, functional LINC complex, chromatin condensation state, cell cycle, and EMT. Interestingly, large forces were also present on nucleoplasmic lamins, indicating that these lamins may also have an important mechanical role in the nucleus.

Current methods for measuring bacterial protease activity in milk are insensitive and too slow to be used in routine testing in dairy processing plants. We have designed a novel bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET)-based biosensor to measure the activity of proteases secreted by bacteria in milk. The BRET-based biosensor is highly selective for bacterial protease activity compared with other proteases tested, notably including plasmin, which is abundant in milk. It incorporates a novel peptide linker that is selectively cleaved by P. fluorescens AprX proteases. The peptide linker is flanked by green fluorescent protein (GFP<sup>2</sup>) at the N-terminus and a variant Renilla luciferase (RLuc2) at the C-terminus. Complete cleavage of the linker by bacterial proteases from Pseudomonas fluorescens strain 65, leads to a 95% decrease in the BRET ratio. We applied an azocasein-based calibration method to the AprX biosensor using standard international enzyme activity units. In a 10-min assay, the detection limit for AprX protease activity in buffer was equivalent to 40 pg/mL (≈0.8 pM, 22 μU/mL) and 100 pg/mL (≈2pM, 54 μU/mL) in 50% (v/v) full fat milk. The EC<sub>50</sub> values were 1.1 ± 0.3 ng/mL (87 μU/mL) and 6.8 ± 0.2 ng/mL (540 μU/mL), respectively. The biosensor was approximately 800x more sensitive than the established FITC-Casein method in a 2-h assay, the shortest feasible time for the latter method. The protease biosensor is sensitive and fast enough to be used in production settings.

Shaking behavior like psychedelia is thought to be mediated by serotonin 2A receptors on cortical pyramidal cells. The involvement of pyramidal cells in psychedelic-induced shaking behavior remains hypothetical, though, as experimental in vivo evidence is limited. (2) Here, we use cell type-specific voltage imaging in awake mice to address this issue. We intersectionally express the genetically encoded voltage indicator VSFP Butterfly 1.2 in layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons. We simultaneously capture cortical hemodynamics and cell type-specific voltage activity while mice display psychedelic shaking behavior. (3) Shaking behavior is preceded by high-frequency oscillations and overlaps with low-frequency oscillations in the motor cortex. Oscillations spectrally mirror the rhythmics of shaking behavior and reflect layer 2/3 pyramidal cell activity complemented by hemodynamics.

The development of different mutations in the Ca2+-sensitive elements of the cameleon probes has allowed sensitive range of Ca2+ measurements in almost all cellular compartments. Region of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) tethered to mitochondria, named as the mitochondrial-associated membranes (MAMs), has received an extended attention since the last 5 years. Indeed, as MAMs are essential for calcium homeostasis and mitochondrial function, molecular tools have been developed to assess quantitatively Ca2+ levels in the MAMs. However, sensitivity of the first generation Ca2+ biosensors on the surface of the outer-mitochondrial membrane (OMM) do not allow to measure μM or sub-μM changes in Ca2+ concentration which prevents to measure the native activity (unstimulated exogenously) of endogenous channels. In this study, we assembled a new ratiometric highly sensitive Ca2+ biosensor expressed on the surface of the outer-mitochondrial membrane (OMM). It allows the detection of smaller differences than the previous biosensor in or at proximity of the MAMs. Noteworthy, we demonstrated that IP3-receptors have an endogenous activity which participate to the Ca2+ leak channel on the surface of the OMM during hypoxia or when SERCA activity is blocked.",

The single catalytic domain is shown to reside within the G32-A149 MLuc7 sequence and to be formed by both non-identical repeats, including 10 conserved Cys residues.

The aberrant expression of circRNAs may result in various diseases. Herein, we demonstrate the construction of genetically encoded light-up RNA aptamers for ultrasensitive and label-free detection of circRNA mitochondrial tRNA translation optimization 1 (circMTO1) in cancer cells and tissues. The light-up RNA aptamers are generated by proximity ligation-activated recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA)-assisted transcription amplification. When circMTO1 is present, it initiates the proximity ligation reaction, activating RPA to produce numerous long double-stranded DNAs containing T7 promoters. Subsequently, the RPA products are identified by T7 RNA polymerase, initiating the transcription amplification reaction to generate abundant Spinach RNA aptamers. Spinach RNA aptamers can bind with DFHBI (3,5-difluoro-4-hydroxybenzylidene imidazolidinone) dye to produce a distinct fluorescence signal with near-zero background. This biosensor exhibits excellent selectivity and high sensitivity with a limit of detection of 2.54 aM. It can accurately monitor cellular circMTO1 at the single-cell level and discriminate the expression of circMTO1 between breast cancer patient tissues and healthy tissues. Notably, this biosensor can be employed to measure other nucleic acids by altering the corresponding target recognition sequences, providing a valuable platform for cancer diagnosis and biomedical study.",

Here, we revealed the localization and activation of Racs in cochlear HCs using GFP-tagged Rac plasmids and transgenic mice expressing a Rac1-fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) biosensor. Furthermore, we employed Rac1-knockout (Rac1-KO, Atoh1-Cre;Rac1<sup>flox/flox</sup>) and Rac1 and Rac3 double KO (Rac1/Rac3-DKO, Atoh1-Cre;Rac1<sup>flox/flox</sup>;Rac3<sup>-/-</sup>) mice, under the control of the Atoh1 promoter. However, both Rac1-KO and Rac1/Rac3-DKO mice exhibited normal cochlear HC morphology at 13 weeks of age and normal hearing function at 24 weeks of age. No hearing vulnerability was observed in young adult (6-week-old) Rac1/Rac3-DKO mice even after intense noise exposure. Consistent with prior reports, the results from Atoh1-Cre;tdTomato mice confirmed that the Atoh1 promoter became functional only after embryonic day 14 when the sensory HC precursors exit the cell cycle. Taken together, these findings indicate that although Rac1 and Rac3 contribute to the early development of sensory epithelia in cochleae, as previously shown, they are dispensable for the maturation of cochlear HCs in the postmitotic state or for hearing maintenance following HC maturation.

To date, various attempts have been made to cultivate <i>Ganoderma</i> to improve the production of secondary metabolites with pharmacological activity. Among the adopted techniques, protoplast preparation and regeneration are indispensable. However, the evaluation of protoplasts and regenerated cell walls usually relies on electron microscopy assays, which require time-consuming and destructive sample preparation and merely provide localized information in the selected area. In contrast, fluorescence assays enable sensitive real-time detection and imaging <i>in vivo</i>. They can also be applied to flow cytometry, providing a collective overview of every cell in a sample. However, for macrofungi such as <i>Ganoderma</i>, the fluorescence analysis of protoplasts and regenerated cell walls is difficult owing to the hindrance of the homologous fluorescent protein expression and the lack of an appropriate fluorescence marker. Herein, a specific plasma membrane probe, TAMRA perfluorocarbon nucleic acid probe (TPFN), is proposed for the nondestructive and quantitative fluorescence analysis of cell wall regeneration. Exploiting the perfluorocarbon membrane-anchoring chains, hydrophilic nucleic acid linker, and fluorescent dye TAMRA, the probe is proven to be selective, soluble, and stable, enabling rapid fluorescence detection of a protoplast sample free of transgenic expression or immune staining. Based on the TPFN and flow cytometry techniques, a quantitative approach is constructed to monitor the process of cell wall growth in a fast, quantitative, and high-throughout manner, and the obtained results are consistent with those of conventional electron microscopy. In principle, with slight modifications or integration, the proposed probe and approach can be adapted to the preparation of cell protoplasts, inspection of cell wall integrity under environmental stress, and programmable membrane engineering for cytobiology and physiology research.",

We engrafted patient and control iPSC-derived neural progenitor cells (hNPCs) into the striatum of mice.

Alongside this improved detection in ENoMi-hNPCs-derived EVs, their surface allows specific immunocapture purification, thereby facilitating TAF1-32i analysis. Using this ENoMi-labeling method, TAF1-32i was demonstrated in EVs released from XDP hNPCs implanted in mouse brains.

In this study, we modulated the performance characteristics, including sensitivity and operating range, of an MphR-based erythromycin biosensor by fine-adjusting regulator expression levels via ribosome-binding site (RBS) engineering and obtained a panel of biosensors with varied sensitivities by iterative fluorescence-assisted cell sorting (FACS) in <i>Escherichia coli</i> to accommodate different screening purposes.

Our previous studies developed genetically encoded, green fluorescent peroxynitrite biosensors by genetically incorporating a boronic acid-containing noncanonical amino acid (ncAA), <i>p</i>-boronophenylalanine (<i>p</i>BoF), into the chromophore of circularly permuted green fluorescent proteins (cpGFPs). In this work, we introduced <i>p</i>BoF to amino acid residues spatially close to the chromophore of an enhanced circularly permuted red fluorescent protein (ecpApple). Our effort has resulted in two responsive ecpApple mutants: one bestows reactivity toward both peroxynitrite and hydrogen peroxide, while the other, namely, pnRFP, is a selective red fluorescent peroxynitrite biosensor. We characterized pnRFP <i>in vitro</i> and in live mammalian cells. We further studied the structure and sensing mechanism of pnRFP using X-ray crystallography, <sup>11</sup>B-NMR, and computational methods. The boron atom in pnRFP adopts an sp<sup>2</sup>-hybridization geometry in a hydrophobic pocket, and the reaction of pnRFP with peroxynitrite generates a product with a twisted chromophore, corroborating the observed \"turn-off\" fluorescence response. Thus, this study extends the color palette of genetically encoded peroxynitrite biosensors, provides insight into the response mechanism of the new biosensor, and demonstrates the versatility of using protein scaffolds to modulate chemoreactivity.",

Using various mutant strains and inhibitors, we show that AKAR3-EV measures the Sch9p- and PKA-dependent phosphorylation status in intact yeast cells. At the single-cell level, we found that the phosphorylation responses are homogenous for glucose, sucrose, and fructose, but heterogeneous for mannose. Cells that start to grow after a transition to mannose correspond to higher normalized Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) levels, in line with the involvement of Sch9p and PKA pathways to stimulate growth-related processes. The Sch9p and PKA pathways have a relatively high affinity for glucose (K0.5 of 0.24 mM) under glucose-derepressed conditions. Lastly, steady-state FRET levels of AKAR3-EV seem to be independent of growth rates, suggesting that Sch9p- and PKA-dependent phosphorylation activities are transient responses to nutrient transitions.

Key tools for studying subcellular AMPK activity are genetically encoded AMPK activity reporters (AMPKARs), which allow for the quantitative visualization of subcelluar AMPK activity. However, many AMPKARs suffer from poor dynamic range and sensitivity, limiting their application. I recently reported the development of a new excitation-ratiometric (ExRai) AMPKAR, a single-fluorophore AMPKAR with enhanced dynamic range for detection of subtle, subcellular AMPK activity.

While transgenic ISC reporter mice are available, advanced translational studies lack a large animal model. This study validates ISC isolation in a new porcine Leucine Rich Repeat Containing G Protein-Coupled Receptor 5 (LGR5) reporter line and demonstrates the use of these pigs as a novel colorectal cancer (CRC) model. We applied histology, immunofluorescence, fluorescence-activated cell sorting, flow cytometry, gene expression quantification, and 3D organoid cultures to whole tissue and single cells from the duodenum, jejunum, ileum, and colon of LGR5-H2B-GFP and wild-type pigs. Ileum and colon LGR5-H2B-GFP, healthy human, and murine biopsies were compared by mRNA fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). To model CRC, adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) mutation was induced by CRISPR/Cas9 editing in porcine LGR5-H2B-GFP colonoids. Crypt-base, green fluorescent protein (GFP) expressing cells co-localized with ISC biomarkers. LGR5-H2B-GFP<sup>hi</sup> cells had significantly higher LGR5 expression (p < .01) and enteroid forming efficiency (p < .0001) compared with LGR5-H2B-GFP<sup>med/lo/neg</sup> cells. Using FISH, similar LGR5, OLFM4, HOPX, LYZ, and SOX9 expression was identified between human and LGR5-H2B-GFP pig crypt-base cells. LGR5-H2B-GFP/APC<sup>null</sup> colonoids had cystic growth in WNT/R-spondin-depleted media and significantly upregulated WNT/β-catenin target gene expression (p < .05). LGR5<sup>+</sup> ISCs are reproducibly isolated in LGR5-H2B-GFP pigs and used to model CRC in an organoid platform.

Many single-emission G4 fluorescent probes that are lit up by inhibiting intramolecular rotation have been reported. However, they are non-fluorescent unless structurally rigidified, making them sensitive to other intracellular crowding and confinement environments in the cell, like viscosity. Ratiometric measurements provide built-in self-calibration for signal correction, enabling more sensitive and reliable detection. Herein, we structurally modulate green fluorescent protein (GFP)-like chromophores by integrating the imidazolidinone scaffold of the GFP chromophore and coumarin 6H, obtaining a G4 responsive dual-emission chromophore, called NHCouI. The red emission signal of NHCouI can specifically respond to parallel G4s, while its green emission signal is inert and acts as an internal reference signal. NHCouI-G4 complexes feature high fluorescence quantum yield and excellent anti-photobleaching properties. NHCouI can self-calibrate the signal and avoid viscosity disturbances within the range of major subcellular organelles during G4 imaging in living cells. It is also applied to reflect the difference between apoptosis and ferroptosis <i>via</i> tracking G4s. To the best of our knowledge, NHCouI is the first small molecule G4 probe enabled by internal reference correction capability, opening up new avenues for dual-emission chromophore development and high-fidelity and reliable analysis in G4 imaging research.",

        "abstract": "Pichia pastoris (Komagataella phaffii) is widely used for industrial production of heterologous proteins due to high secretory capabilities but selection of highly productive engineered strains remains a limiting step. Despite availability of a comprehensive molecular toolbox for construct design and gene integration, there is high clonal variability among transformants due to frequent multi-copy and off-target random integration. Therefore, functional screening of several hundreds of transformant clones is essential to identify the best protein production strains. Screening methods are commonly based on deep-well plate cultures with analysis by immunoblotting or enzyme activity assays of post-induction samples, and each heterologous protein produced may require development of bespoke assays with multiple sample processing steps. In this work, we developed a generic system based on a P. pastoris strain that uses a protein-based biosensor to identify highly productive protein secretion clones from a heterogeneous set of transformants. The biosensor uses a split green fluorescent protein where the large GFP fragment (GFP1-10) is fused to a sequence-specific protease from Tobacco Etch Virus (TEV) and is targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum. Recombinant proteins targeted for secretion are tagged with the small fragment of the split GFP (GFP11). Recombinant protein production can be measured by monitoring GFP fluorescence, which is dependent on interaction between the large and small GFP fragments. The reconstituted GFP is cleaved from the target protein by TEV protease, allowing for secretion of the untagged protein of interest and intracellular retention of the mature GFP. We demonstrate this technology with four recombinant proteins (phytase, laccase, β-casein and β-lactoglobulin) and show that the biosensor directly reports protein production levels that correlate with traditional assays. Our results confirm that the split GFP biosensor can be used for facile, generic, and rapid screening of P. pastoris clones to identify those with the highest production levels.",

Such particles also contaminate surfaces, creating a potential surface-transmission pathway. A fast acoustic biosensor with an antifouling nano-coating was introduced to detect severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on exposed surfaces in the Prague Public Transport System. Samples were measured directly without pre-treatment. Results with the sensor gave excellent agreement with parallel quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) measurements on 482 surface samples taken from actively used trams, buses, metro trains and platforms between 7 and 9 April 2021, in the middle of the lineage Alpha SARS-CoV-2 epidemic wave when 1 in 240 people were COVID-19 positive in Prague. Only ten of the 482 surface swabs produced positive results and none of them contained virus particles capable of replication, indicating that positive samples contained inactive virus particles and/or fragments. Measurements of the rate of decay of SARS-CoV-2 on frequently touched surface materials showed that the virus did not remain viable longer than 1-4 h. The rate of inactivation was the fastest on rubber handrails in metro escalators and the slowest on hard-plastic seats, window glasses and stainless-steel grab rails. As a result of this study, Prague Public Transport Systems revised their cleaning protocols and the lengths of parking times during the pandemic. Our findings suggest that surface transmission played no or negligible role in spreading SARS-CoV-2 in Prague.

        "abstract": "Basement membranes (BMs) are thin, sheet-like extracellular structures that cover the basal side of epithelial and endothelial tissues and provide structural and functional support to adjacent cell layers. The molecular structure of BMs is a fine meshwork that incorporates specialized extracellular matrix proteins. Recently, live visualization of BMs in invertebrates demonstrated that their structure is flexible and dynamically rearranged during cell differentiation and organogenesis. However, the BM dynamics in mammalian tissues remain to be elucidated. We developed a mammalian BM imaging probe based on nidogen-1, a major BM-specific protein. Recombinant human nidogen-1 fused with an enhanced green fluorescent protein (Nid1-EGFP) retains its ability to bind to other BM proteins, such as laminin, type IV collagen, and perlecan, in a solid-phase binding assay. When added to the culture medium of embryoid bodies derived from mouse ES cells, recombinant Nid1-EGFP accumulated in the BM zone of embryoid bodies, and BMs were visualized <i>in vitro</i>. For <i>in vivo</i> BM imaging, a knock-in reporter mouse line expressing human nidogen-1 fused to the red fluorescent protein mCherry (R26-CAG-Nid1-mCherry) was generated. R26-CAG-Nid1-mCherry showed fluorescently labeled BMs in early embryos and adult tissues, such as the epidermis, intestine, and skeletal muscles, whereas BM fluorescence was unclear in several other tissues, such as the lung and heart. In the retina, Nid1-mCherry fluorescence visualized the BMs of vascular endothelium and pericytes. In the developing retina, Nid1-mCherry fluorescence labeled the BM of the major central vessels; however, the BM fluorescence were hardly observed in the peripheral growing tips of the vascular network, despite the presence of endothelial BM. Time-lapse observation of the retinal vascular BM after photobleaching revealed gradual recovery of Nid1-mCherry fluorescence, suggesting the turnover of BM components in developing retinal blood vessels. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of <i>in vivo</i> BM imaging using a genetically engineered mammalian model. Although R26-CAG-Nid1-mCherry has some limitations as an <i>in vivo</i> BM imaging model, it has potential applications in the study of BM dynamics during mammalian embryogenesis, tissue regeneration, and pathogenesis.",

Once activated by the target, the fluorescent probe can be excited by NanoLuc to generate a remarkable BRET signal, resulting in obvious color changes of luminescence, which can be easily recorded and quantitatively analyzed by a smartphone. As a proof of concept, a fluorescent probe for HOCl was synthesized to construct the bioluminescent system. Results demonstrated the system showed a constant blue/red emission ratio which is independent to the signal intensity, allowing the quantification of HOCl concentration with high sensitivity (limit of detection (LOD) = 13 nM) and accuracy.

        "abstract": "The mesolimbic dopamine system is an evolutionarily conserved set of brain circuits that play a role in attention, appetitive behavior, and reward processing. In this circuitry, ascending dopaminergic projections from the ventral midbrain innervate targets throughout the limbic forebrain, such as the ventral striatum/nucleus accumbens (NAc). Dopaminergic signaling in the NAc has been widely studied for its role in behavioral reinforcement, reward prediction error encoding, and motivational salience. Less well characterized is the role of dopaminergic neurotransmission in the response to surprising or alerting sensory events. To address this, we used the genetically encoded dopamine sensor dLight1 and fiber photometry to explore the ability of striatal dopamine release to encode the properties of salient sensory stimuli in mice, such as threatening looming discs. Here, we report that lateral NAc (LNAc) dopamine release encodes the rate and magnitude of environmental luminance changes rather than the visual stimulus threat level. This encoding is highly sensitive, as LNAc dopamine could be evoked by light intensities that were imperceptible to human experimenters. We also found that light-evoked dopamine responses are wavelength-dependent at low irradiances, independent of the circadian cycle, robust to previous exposure history, and involve multiple phototransduction pathways. Thus, we have further elaborated the mesolimbic dopamine system's ability to encode visual information in mice, which is likely relevant to a wide body of scientists employing light sources or optical methods in behavioral research involving rodents.",

        "abstract": "pH-sensitive fluorescent proteins are widely used to study synaptic vesicle (SV) fusion and recycling. When targeted to the lumen of SVs, fluorescence of these proteins is quenched by the acidic pH. Following SV fusion, they are exposed to extracellular neutral pH, resulting in a fluorescence increase. SV fusion, recycling and acidification can thus be tracked by tagging integral SV proteins with pH-sensitive proteins. Neurotransmission is generally activated by electrical stimulation, which is not feasible in small, intact animals. Previous <i>in vivo</i> approaches depended on distinct (sensory) stimuli, thus limiting the addressable neuron types. To overcome these limitations, we established an all-optical approach to stimulate and visualize SV fusion and recycling. We combined distinct pH-sensitive fluorescent proteins (inserted into the SV protein synaptogyrin) and light-gated channelrhodopsins (ChRs) for optical stimulation, overcoming optical crosstalk and thus enabling an all-optical approach. We generated two different variants of the pH-sensitive optogenetic reporter of vesicle recycling (pOpsicle) and tested them in cholinergic neurons of intact <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> nematodes. First, we combined the red fluorescent protein pHuji with the blue-light gated ChR2(H134R), and second, the green fluorescent pHluorin combined with the novel red-shifted ChR ChrimsonSA. In both cases, fluorescence increases were observed after optical stimulation. Increase and subsequent decline of fluorescence was affected by mutations of proteins involved in SV fusion and endocytosis.

The recent years have shown great progress in drug-targeting Ras and understanding how it operates on the plasma membrane. We now know that Ras is non-randomly organized into proteo-lipid complexes on the membrane, called nanoclusters. Nanoclusters contain only a few Ras proteins and are necessary for the recruitment of downstream effectors, such as Raf. If tagged with fluorescent proteins, the dense packing of Ras in nanoclusters can be analyzed by Förster/ fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). Loss of FRET can therefore report on decreased nanoclustering and any process upstream of it, such as Ras lipid modifications and correct trafficking. Thus, cellular FRET screens employing Ras-derived fluorescence biosensors are potentially powerful tools to discover chemical or genetic modulators of functional Ras membrane organization. Here we implement fluorescence anisotropy-based homo-FRET measurements of Ras-derived constructs labelled with only one fluorescent protein on a confocal microscope and a fluorescence plate reader. We show that homo-FRET of both H-Ras- and K-Ras-derived constructs can sensitively report on Ras-lipidation and -trafficking inhibitors, as well as on genetic perturbations of proteins regulating membrane anchorage. By exploiting the switch I/II-binding Ras-dimerizing compound BI-2852, this assay is also suitable to report on the engagement of the K-Ras switch II pocket by small molecules such as AMG 510.

Double-cut and double-nick donor formats significantly improved targeting accuracy by 2.3-8.3-fold and 19-22-fold, respectively, compared to standard circular donors.

Multiplexed imaging of live human cells co-expressing cyan, yellow, and red ATOM sensors detected the biosensor targets (WDR5, SH2, and hRAS proteins) that were localized to the nucleus, cytoplasm, and plasma membrane, respectively, with high specificity.

        "abstract": "Visceral smooth muscle cells (SMCs) are an integral component of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract that regulate GI motility. SMC contraction is regulated by posttranslational signaling and the state of differentiation. Impaired SMC contraction is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, but the mechanisms regulating SMC-specific contractile gene expression, including the role of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), remain largely unexplored. Herein, we reveal a critical role of Carmn (cardiac mesoderm enhancer-associated noncoding RNA), an SMC-specific lncRNA, in regulating visceral SMC phenotype and contractility of the GI tract. Genotype-Tissue Expression and publicly available single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data sets from embryonic, adult human, and mouse GI tissues were interrogated to identify SMC-specific lncRNAs. The functional role of Carmn was investigated using novel green fluorescent protein (GFP) knock-in (KI) reporter/knock-out (KO) mice. Bulk RNA-seq and single nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) of colonic muscularis were used to investigate underlying mechanisms. Unbiased in silico analyses and GFP expression patterns in Carmn GFP KI mice revealed that Carmn is highly expressed in GI SMCs in humans and mice. Premature lethality was observed in global Carmn KO and inducible SMC-specific KO mice due to GI pseudo-obstruction and severe distension of the GI tract, with dysmotility in cecum and colon segments. Histology, GI transit, and muscle myography analysis revealed severe dilation, significantly delayed GI transit, and impaired GI contractility in Carmn KO vs control mice. Bulk RNA-seq of GI muscularis revealed that loss of Carmn promotes SMC phenotypic switching, as evidenced by up-regulation of extracellular matrix genes and down-regulation of SMC contractile genes, including Mylk, a key regulator of SMC contraction. snRNA-seq further revealed SMC Carmn KO not only compromised myogenic motility by reducing contractile gene expression but also impaired neurogenic motility by disrupting cell-cell connectivity in the colonic muscularis. These findings may have translational significance, because silencing CARMN in human colonic SMCs significantly attenuated contractile gene expression, including MYLK, and decreased SMC contractility. Luciferase reporter assays showed that CARMN enhances the transactivation activity of the master regulator of SMC contractile phenotype, myocardin, thereby maintaining the GI SMC myogenic program. Our data suggest that Carmn is indispensable for maintaining GI SMC contractile function in mice and that loss of function of CARMN may contribute to human visceral myopathy. To our knowledge this is the first study showing an essential role of lncRNA in the regulation of visceral SMC phenotype.",

In this system, the target DNA is captured by a complementary methylated probe DNA. When the target DNA is methylated, a symmetrically methylated CpG is formed in the double-stranded DNA.

Further biochemical and genetic evidence demonstrated that the degradation of LhcB2-GFP to dLhcB2-GFP was disrupted in pga4 and yellow variegated2 (var2) mutants caused by mutations in the Filamentous Temperature-Sensitive H2 (VAR2/AtFtsH2) subunit of thylakoid FtsH. The yeast two-hybrid assay showed that the N-terminus of LhcB2-GFP interacts with the protease domain of VAR2/AtFtsH2. Moreover, the over-accumulated LhcB2-GFP in pga4 and var2 formed protein aggregates, which were insoluble in mild nonionic detergents. Genetically, cpSRP54 is a suppressor locus for the leaf variegation phenotype of var2. Together, these results demonstrate the coordination of cpSRP54 and thylakoid FtsH in maintaining thylakoid membrane PQC during the assembly of photosynthetic complexes and provide a trackable substrate and product for monitoring cpSRP54-dependent protein translocation and FtsH-dependent protein degradation.",

Fluorescent protein-based reporters to measure intracellular H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> have been developed in recent decades. In particular, the redox-sensitive green fluorescent protein (roGFP)-based proteins fused to peroxiredoxins are among the most sensitive H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> biosensors. Using fission yeast as a model system, we recently demonstrated that the gradient of extracellular-to-intracellular peroxides through the plasma membrane is around 300:1, and that the concentration of physiological H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is in the low nanomolar range. Here, we have expressed the very sensitive probe roGFP2-Tpx1.C169S in two other model systems, budding yeast and human Jurkat cells. As in fission yeast, the biosensor is ~40-50% oxidized in these cell types, suggesting similar peroxide steady-state levels. Furthermore, probe oxidation upon the addition of extracellular peroxides is also quantitatively similar, suggesting comparable plasma membrane H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> gradients. Finally, as a proof of concept, we have applied different concentrations of zinc to all three model systems and have detected probe oxidation, demonstrating that an excess of this metal can cause fluctuations of peroxides, which are moderate in yeasts and severe in mammalian cells. We conclude that the principles governing H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> fluxes are very similar in different model organisms.",

However, the lack of internal controls subject functional bioluminescence to a number of unpredictable variables that reduce this powerful tool to semi-quantitative interpretation of large-scale effects. Here, we report the generation of sensitive and quantitative live reporters for two key measures of functional cancer biology and pharmacologic stress: the cell cycle and oxidative stress. We developed a two-colored readout, where two independent enzymes convert a common imaging substrate into spectrally distinguishable light. The signal intensity of one color is dependent upon the biological state, whereas the other color is constitutively expressed. The ratio of emitted colored light corrects the functional signal for independent procedural variables, substantially improving the robustness and interpretation of relatively low-fold changes in functional signal intensity after drug treatment. The application of these readouts in vitro is highly advantageous, as peak cell response to therapy can now be readily visualized for single or combination treatments and not simply assessed at an arbitrary and destructive timepoint. Spectral imaging in vivo can be challenging, but we also present evidence to show that the reporters can work in this context as well. Collectively, the development and validation of these internally controlled reporters allow researchers to robustly and dynamically visualize tumor cell biology in response to treatment. Given the prevalence of bioluminescence imaging, this presents significant and much needed opportunities for preclinical therapeutic development.",

There is an increasing interest in the use of engineered bacteria as diagnostic and therapeutic tools for gut diseases. In this study, we developed genetic circuits capable of sensing SCFA concentrations to build biosensors that express a response protein (superfolder green fluorescent protein [sfGFP]) in amounts inversely proportional to the SCFA concentration. We also built biotherapeutics expressing the cytokine granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) using the same logic. The propionate biotherapeutic expressed larger amounts of mouse GM-CSF in the absence of propionate. The butyrate biotherapeutics presented the expected behavior only at the beginning of the kinetics and an accelerated response in the absence of butyrate. Overall, these genetic systems may function as complementary diagnostic tools for measuring SCFAs and as delivery vehicles for biotherapeutic molecules. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Short-chain fatty acids are key molecules produced by the gut microbiome.

This can occur by insertion of multiple novel independent transcription units between the ORF sequences of the PRRSV genome. Here, an expression cassette consisting of a red fluorescent protein (RFP) gene flanked at its 3' end by transcription-regulating sequences (TRS) and an expression cassette consisting of an iLOV gene flanked at its 5' end by TRS, was constructed. The resulting expression cassette containing a RFP and an iLOV gene were introduced between ORF1b and 2 as well as ORF7 and 3'UTR, respectively, in an infectious PRRSV cDNA clone. Transfection of the resulting clone (pGX-12RFP-73iLOV) into cells resulted in the recovery of a recombinant virus (rGX-12RFP-73iLOV). Simultaneous expression of RFP and iLOV was observed in MARC-145 cells infected with rGX-RFP-iLOV. To test the ability of the PRRSV genome to express all three reporter genes simultaneously, an expression cassette containing the Gluc gene and one containing the iLOV gene were also inserted in between ORF1b and 2 as well as ORF7 and 3'UTR, respectively. This was performed in a recently obtained infectious PRRSV cDNA clone carrying a RFP gene in nsp2. Transfection of the construct (pGX-R-Gluc-iLOV) carrying the three reporter genes into cells allowed the rescue of the recombinant reporter virus (rGX-R-Gluc-iLOV) which showed similar growth characteristics to the parental virus but yielded 100-fold less infectious viruses. Fluorescence microscopy of cells infected with rGX-R-Gluc-iLOV demonstrated the presence of both RFP and iLOV genes. Gluc activities in supernatants harvested at different time points from cells infected with recombinant viruses carrying Gluc showed increased levels of Gluc activity as the infection progressed. This indicated that Gluc gene as well as its activity were acceptable parameters to monitor viral propagation.

Through sensing promoter characterization and engineering, the biosensor exhibiting excellent specificity and dynamic range was developed, and applied for directed evolution of myrcene synthase. After high-throughput screening of the myrcene synthase random mutation library, the best mutant R89G/N152S/D517N was obtained. Its catalytic efficiency was 1.47-fold than that of parent. Based on the mutants, the final production of myrcene reached 510.38 mg/L, which is the highest myrcene titer reported to date.

Here we introduce a genetically encoded sensor system to detect the dissociation events of aGPCR heterodimers into their constituent N-terminal and C-terminal fragments (NTFs and CTFs, respectively). An NTF release sensor (NRS) of the neural latrophilin-type aGPCR Cirl (ADGRL)<sup>9-11</sup>, from Drosophila melanogaster, is stimulated by mechanical force. Cirl-NRS activation indicates that receptor dissociation occurs in neurons and cortex glial cells. The release of NTFs from cortex glial cells requires trans-interaction between Cirl and its ligand, the Toll-like receptor Tollo (Toll-8)<sup>12</sup>, on neural progenitor cells, whereas expressing Cirl and Tollo in cis suppresses dissociation of the aGPCR. This interaction is necessary to control the size of the neuroblast pool in the central nervous system. We conclude that receptor autoproteolysis enables non-cell-autonomous activities of aGPCRs, and that the dissociation of aGPCRs is controlled by their ligand expression profile and by mechanical force. The NRS system will be helpful in elucidating the physiological roles and signal modulators of aGPCRs, which constitute a large untapped reservoir of drug targets for cardiovascular, immune, neuropsychiatric and neoplastic diseases<sup>13</sup>.",

It mediated the specific phage-derived interference in the signal measured with the time-resolved luminescence. Most importantly, our results confirmed that the presented bifunctional phage with its liquid crystal properties enabled the measurement of GFP in a concentration-dependent, quantitative manner with a limit of detection of 0.24 µg/mL.

Although it is well-documented that better-than-expected outcomes are encoded quantitatively via midbrain dopaminergic (DA) activity, it has been less addressed experimentally whether worse-than-expected outcomes are expressed quantitatively as well. We show that larger reward expectations upon unexpected reward omissions are associated with the preceding slower rise and following larger decrease (DA dip) in the DA concentration at the ventral striatum of mice. We set up a lever press task on a fixed ratio (FR) schedule requiring five lever presses as an effort for a food reward (FR5). The mice occasionally checked the food magazine without a reward before completing the task. The percentage of this premature magazine entry (PME) increased as the number of lever presses approached five, showing rising expectations with increasing proximity to task completion, and hence greater reward expectations. Fibre photometry of extracellular DA dynamics in the ventral striatum using a fluorescent protein (genetically encoded GPCR activation-based DA sensor: GRAB<sub>DA2m</sub> ) revealed that the slow increase and fast decrease in DA levels around PMEs were correlated with the PME percentage, demonstrating a monotonic relationship between the DA dip amplitude and degree of expectations. Computational modelling of the lever press task implementing temporal difference errors and state transitions replicated the observed correlation between the PME frequency and DA dip amplitude in the FR5 task. Taken together, these findings indicate that the DA dip amplitude represents the degree of reward expectations monotonically, which may guide behavioural adjustment.",

Several types of fluorescent protein-stabilized gold nanoclusters (protein-AuNCs) have been developed for sensitive and easy detection of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. However, its low sensitivity makes is difficult to measure negligible concentrations of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Therefore, to overcome this limitation, we developed a horseradish peroxidase-encapsulated fluorescent bio-nanoparticle (HEFBNP), comprising bovine serum albumin-stabilized gold nanoclusters (BSA-AuNCs) and horseradish peroxidase-stabilized gold nanoclusters (HRP-AuNCs). The fabricated HEFBNP can sensitively detect H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> owing to its two properties. The first is that HEFBNPs have a continuous two-step fluorescence quenching mechanism, which comes from the heterogenous fluorescence quenching mechanism of HRP-AuNCs and BSA-AuNCs. Second, the proximity of two protein-AuNCs in a single HEFBNP allows a reaction intermediate (•OH) to rapidly reach the adjacent protein-AuNCs. As a result, HEFBNP can improve the overall reaction event and decrease the loss of intermediate in the solution. Due to the continuous quenching mechanism and effective reaction event, a HEFBNP-based sensing system can measure very low concentrations of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> up to 0.5 nM and show good selectivity. Furthermore, we design a glass-based microfluidic device to make it easier use HEFBNP, which allowed us to detect H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> with the naked eye.

Measuring the free cellular calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) concentrations <i>in vivo</i> with genetically encodable FPs can be a relatively direct measure of neuronal activity due to the complex signaling role of these ions. REX-GECO1 is a recently developed red-green emission and excitation ratiometric FP-based biosensor that achieves a high dynamic range due to differences in the chromophore response to light excitation with and without calcium ions. Using steady-state electronic measurements (UV/Visible absorption and emission), along with time-resolved spectroscopic techniques including femtosecond transient absorption (fs-TA) and femtosecond stimulated Raman spectroscopy (FSRS), the potential energy surfaces of these unique biosensors are unveiled with vivid details. The ground-state structural characterization of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free biosensor via FSRS reveals a more spacious protein pocket that allows the chromophore to efficiently twist and reach a dark state.

        "abstract": "Many Gram-negative pathogens rely on type IV secretion systems (T4SS) for infection. One limitation has been the lack of ideal reporters to identify T4SS translocated effectors and study T4SS function. Most reporter systems make use of fusions to reporter proteins, in particular, β-lactamase (TEM) and calmodulin-dependent adenylate cyclase (CYA), that allow detection of translocated enzymatic activity inside host cells. However, both systems require costly reagents and use complex, multistep procedures for loading host cells with substrate (TEM) or for analysis (CYA). Therefore, we have developed and characterized a novel reporter system using nanoluciferase (NLuc) fusions to address these limitations. Serendipitously, we discovered that Nluc itself is efficiently translocated by Legionella pneumophila T4SS in an IcmSW chaperone-dependent manner via an N-terminal translocation signal. Extensive mutagenesis in the NLuc N terminus suggested the importance of an α-helical domain spanning D5 to V9, as mutations predicted to disrupt this structure, with one exception, were translocation defective. Notably, NLuc was capable of translocating several proteins examined when fused to the N or C terminus, while maintaining robust luciferase activity. In particular, it delivered the split GFP11 fragment into J774 macrophages transfected with GFPopt, thereby resulting in <i>in vivo</i> assembly of superfolder green fluorescent protein (GFP). This provided a bifunctional assay in which translocation could be assayed by fluorescence microplate, confocal microscopy, and/or luciferase assays. We further identified an optimal NLuc substrate which allowed a robust, inexpensive, one-step, high-throughput screening assay to identify T4SS translocation substrates and inhibitors. Taken together, these results indicate that NLuc provides both new insight into and also tools for studying T4SS biology. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Type IV secretion systems (T4SS) are used by Gram-negative pathogens to coopt host cell function. However, the translocation signals recognized by T4SS are not fully explained by primary amino acid sequence, suggesting yet-to-be-defined contributions of secondary and tertiary structure. Here, we unexpectedly identified nanoluciferase (NLuc) as an efficient IcmSW-dependent translocated T4SS substrate, and we provide extensive mutagenesis data suggesting that the first N-terminal, alpha-helix domain is a critical translocation recognition motif. Notably, most existing reporter systems for studying translocated proteins make use of fusions to reporters to permit detection of translocated enzymatic activity inside the host cell.

        "abstract": "Although several mechanisms of macroautophagy/autophagy have been dissected in the last decade, following this pathway in real time remains challenging. Among the early events leading to its activation, the ATG4B protease primes the key autophagy player MAP1LC3B/LC3B. Given the lack of reporters to follow this event in living cells, we developed a Förster's resonance energy transfer (FRET) biosensor responding to the priming of LC3B by ATG4B. The biosensor was generated by flanking LC3B within a pH-resistant donor-acceptor FRET pair, Aquamarine-tdLanYFP. We here showed that the biosensor has a dual readout. First, FRET indicates the priming of LC3B by ATG4B and the resolution of the FRET image makes it possible to characterize the spatial heterogeneity of the priming activity. Second, quantifying the number of Aquamarine-LC3B puncta determines the degree of autophagy activation. We then showed that there are pools of unprimed LC3B upon <i>ATG4B</i> downregulation, and the priming of the biosensor is abolished in <i>ATG4B</i> knockout cells. The lack of priming can be rescued with the wild-type ATG4B or with the partially active W142A mutant, but not with the catalytically dead C74S mutant. Moreover, we screened for commercially-available ATG4B inhibitors, and illustrated their differential mode of action by implementing a spatially-resolved, broad-to-sensitive analysis pipeline combining FRET and the quantification of autophagic puncta. Finally, we uncovered the CDK1-dependent regulation of the ATG4B-LC3B axis at mitosis. Therefore, the LC3B FRET biosensor paves the way for a highly-quantitative monitoring of the ATG4B activity in living cells and in real time, with unprecedented spatiotemporal resolution.<b>Abbreviations:</b> Aqua: aquamarine; ATG: autophagy related; AURKA: aurora kinase A; BafA<sub>1</sub>: bafilomycin A<sub>1</sub>; CDK1: cyclin dependent kinase 1; DKO: double knockout; FLIM: fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy; FP: fluorescence protein; FRET: Förster's resonance energy transfer; GABARAP: GABA type A receptor-associated protein; HBSS: Hanks' balanced salt solution; KO: knockout; LAMP2: lysosomal associated membrane protein 2; MAP1LC3/LC3: microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3; NSC: NSC 185058; PE: phosphatidylethanolamine; SKO: single knockout; TKO: triple knockout; ULK1: unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase 1; WT: wild-type; ZPCK: <i>Z-L</i>-phe chloromethyl ketone.",

Herein, we characterize a newly created <i>Prrx1eGFP</i> reporter transgenic mouse line during limb formation and postnatally. Interestingly, in the embryo <i>Prrx1eGFP</i>-labeled cells become restricted around the Sox9-positive cartilage anlage without themselves becoming Sox9-positive. In the adult, the <i>Prrx1eGFP</i> transgene live labels a subpopulation of cells within the periosteum that are enriched at specific sites, and this population is diminished in aged mice. The green fluorescent protein (GFP)-labeled subpopulation can be isolated using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and represents approximately 8% of all isolated periosteal cells. The GFP-labeled subpopulation is significantly more osteogenic than unlabeled, GFP-negative periosteal cells. In addition, the osteogenic and chondrogenic capacity of periosteal cells in vitro can be extended with the addition of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) to the expansion media. We provide evidence to suggest that osteoblasts contributing to cortical bone formation in the embryo originate from <i>Prrx1eGFP</i>-positive cells within the perichondrium, which possibly piggyback on invading vascular cells and secrete new bone matrix.

        "abstract": "As main recipient cells for porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), porcine alveolar macrophage (PAM) are involved in the progress of several highly pathogenic virus infections. However, due to the fact that the PAM cells can only be obtained from primary tissues, research on PAM-based virus-host interactions remains challenging. The improvement of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) technology provides a new strategy to develop IPSCs-derived PAM cells. Since the CD163 is a macrophage-specific marker and a validated receptor essential for PRRSV infection, generation of stable porcine induced pluripotent stem cells lines containing CD163 reporter system play important roles in the investigation of IPSCs-PAM transition and PAM-based virus-host interaction. Based on the CRISPR/Cas9- mediated gene editing system, we designed a sgRNA targeting CD163 locus and constructed the corresponding donor vectors. To test whether this reporter system has the expected function, the reporter system was introduced into primary PAM cells to detect the expression of RFP. To validate the low effect on stem cell pluripotency, we generated porcine iPSC lines containing CD163 reporter and assessed the pluripotency through multiple assays such as alkaline phosphatase staining, immunofluorescent staining, and EdU staining. The red-fluorescent protein (RFP) expression was detected in CD163-edited PAM cells, suggesting that our reporter system indeed has the ability to reflect the expression of gene <i>CD163</i>. Compared with wild-type (WT) iPSCs, the CD163 reporter-iPSCs display similar pluripotency-associated transcription factors expression. Besides, cells with the reporter system showed consistent cell morphology and proliferation ability as compared to WT iPSCs, indicating that the edited-cells have no effect on stem cell pluripotency. In conclusion, we generated porcine iPSCs that contain a CD163 reporter system. Our results demonstrated that this reporter system was functional and safe. This study provides a platform to investigate the iPS-PAM development and virus-host interaction in PAM cells.",

However, to obtain a large amount of data on enzyme activities for training data, it is necessary to develop a high-throughput and accurate method for evaluating enzyme activities. Here, we examined whether a biosensor-based enzyme engineering method can be applied to machine learning. As a model experiment, we aimed to modify the substrate specificity of XylM<i>,</i> a rate-determining enzyme in a multistep oxidation reaction catalyzed by XylMABC in <i>Pseudomonas putida</i>. XylMABC naturally converts toluene and xylene to benzoic acid and toluic acid, respectively. We aimed to engineer XylM to improve its conversion efficiency to a non-native substrate, 2,6-xylenol. Wild-type XylMABC slightly converted 2,6-xylenol to 3-methylsalicylic acid, which is the ligand of the transcriptional regulator XylS in <i>P. putida</i>. By locating a fluorescent protein gene under the control of the <i>Pm</i> promoter to which XylS binds, a XylS-producing <i>Escherichia coli</i> strain showed higher fluorescence intensity in a 3-methylsalicylic acid concentration-dependent manner. We evaluated the 3-methylsalicylic acid productivity of XylM variants using the fluorescence intensity of the sensor strain as an indicator. The obtained data provided the training data for machine learning for the directed evolution of XylM. Two cycles of machine learning-assisted directed evolution resulted in the acquisition of XylM-D140E-V144K-F243L-N244S with 15 times higher productivity than wild-type XylM. These results demonstrate that an indirect enzyme activity evaluation method using biosensors is sufficiently quantitative and high-throughput to be used as training data for machine learning.

Sensitive genetically-encoded fluorescent glutamate reporters operating with a range of affinities and emission wavelengths are available. However, without targeting to synapses, the specificity of the fluorescent signal is uncertain, compared to sensors directed at vesicles or other synaptic markers. We fused the state-of-the-art reporter iGluSnFR to glutamate receptor auxiliary proteins in order to target it to postsynaptic sites. Chimeras of Stargazin and gamma-8 that we named SnFR-γ2 and SnFR-γ8, were enriched at synapses, retained function and reported spontaneous glutamate release in rat hippocampal cells, with apparently diffraction-limited spatial precision. In autaptic mouse neurons cultured on astrocytic microislands, evoked neurotransmitter release could be quantitatively detected at tens of synapses in a field of view whilst evoked currents were recorded simultaneously. These experiments revealed a specific postsynaptic deficit from Stargazin overexpression, resulting in synapses with normal neurotransmitter release but without postsynaptic responses. This defect was reverted by delaying overexpression. By working at different calcium concentrations, we determined that SnFR-γ2 is a linear reporter of the global quantal parameters and short-term synaptic plasticity, whereas iGluSnFR is not. On average, half of iGluSnFR regions of interest (ROIs) showing evoked fluorescence changes had intense rundown, whereas less than 5% of SnFR-γ2 ROIs did. We provide an open-source analysis suite for extracting quantal parameters including release probability from fluorescence time series of individual and grouped synaptic responses. Taken together, postsynaptic targeting improves several properties of iGluSnFR and further demonstrates the importance of subcellular targeting for optogenetic actuators and reporters.",

For instance, our attempts to mask the carboxylic acid moiety with standard self-immolative benzyl linkers resulted in significant background signals owing to undesirable ester hydrolysis. In this study, we overcame this longstanding challenge by rationally designing a new hydrolysis-resistant ester-based linker featuring an isopropyl shielding arm. Compared to the parent, the new design is 140.5-fold and 67.8-fold more resistant toward spontaneous and esterase-mediated hydrolysis, respectively. Likewise, we observed minimal cleavage of the ester moiety when incubated with a panel of enzymes possessing ester-hydrolyzing activity. These impressive in vitro results were corroborated through a series of key experiments in live cells. Further, we showcased the utility of this technology by developing the first NIR bioluminescent probe for nitroreductase (NTR) activity and applied it to visualize elevated NTR expression in oxygen deficient lung cancer cells and in a murine model of non-small cell lung cancer. The ability to monitor the activity of this key biomarker in a deep tissue context is critical because it is associated with tumor hypoxia, which in turn is linked to drug resistance and aggressive cancer phenotypes.",

Several genes in the <i>mnt</i>-operon of <i>E. coli</i> respond to intercellular Mn(II) levels, and transcription is regulated by a transcription factor (MntR) that interacts with Mn(II). This study aimed to develop Mn(II)-sensing biosensors based on <i>mnt</i>-operon genetic systems. Additionally, the properties of biosensors developed based on the promoter regions of <i>mntS</i>, <i>mntH</i>, and <i>mntP</i> were investigated. MntR represses the transcription of MntS and MntH after binding with Mn(II), while it induces MntP transcription. Thus, Mn(II) biosensors that decrease and increase signals could be obtained by fusing the promoter regions of <i>mntS/mntH</i> and <i>mntP</i>, with <i>egfp</i> encoding an enhanced green fluorescent protein. However, only the biosensor-based <i>mntS:egfp</i> responded to Mn(II) exposure. Further, <i>E. coli</i> harboring <i>P <sub><i>mntS</i></sub> :egfp</i> showed a concentration-dependent decrease in fluorescence signals. To enhance the sensitivity of the biosensor toward Mn(II), <i>E. coli</i> containing a deleted MntP gene that encodes Mn(II) exporter, was used as a host cell for biosensor development. The sensitivity toward Mn(II) increased by two times on using <i>E. coli-mntP</i>, and the biosensor could quantify 0.01-10 μM of Mn(II). Further, the applicability of Mn(II) in artificially contaminated water samples was quantified and showed >95% accuracy. The newly developed Mn(II) biosensors could detect and quantify the residual Mn(II) from mancozeb in soil samples, with the quantification accuracy being approximately 90%.

        "abstract": "Monocytes play a significant role in the pathogenesis of most inflammatory diseases, including autoimmune diseases. Herein, different subpopulations of monocytes often play differential, partially antagonistic roles, in the regulation of tissue populations. Pemphigoid diseases constitute a group of autoimmune blistering skin diseases featuring a marked infiltration of the dermis with immune cells, including monocytes. The monocyte subsets infiltrating the skin, however, have largely remained elusive. Monocyte adhesion and recruitment into the inflamed tissues are regulated by chemokine receptors, most prominently by CCR2 and CX3CR1. To delineate the involvement of monocyte populations in autoimmune blistering skin diseases, we spatiotemporally monitored the dynamic spectrum of monocyte populations that infiltrate the inflamed skin using multiphoton intravital imaging and reporter mice for chemokine receptors. Experimental epidermolysis bullosa acquisita (EBA) was induced by injection of anti-murine type VII collagen (amCOLVII) IgG into the Csf1r<sup>EGFP</sup>-reporter mice, where circulating myeloid cells, such as monocytes and neutrophils, express an EGFP. EGFP<sup>+</sup> cells, including neutrophils and monocytes, were present in the skin, immediately after the deposition of the amCOLVII antibody at the dermal-epidermal junction. To investigate the recruitment and involvement of different monocyte-derived cell populations in the disease course further, EBA was induced in CCR2<sup>RFP/+</sup>-reporter and CX3CR1<sup>GFP/+</sup>-reporter mice. A comparable distribution of red fluorescent protein (RFP)<sup>+</sup> or green fluorescent protein (GFP)<sup>+</sup> was found in both diseased mice and their respective controls over time, indicating the similar recruitment of monocytes into the skin following the binding of autoantibodies. Experiments were extended to the CCR2<sup>RFP/RFP</sup>-deficient and CX3CR1<sup>GFP/GFP</sup>-deficient mice to determine whether monocyte recruitment and disease severity are compromised in the absence of the receptor. A comparable pattern was seen in the recruitment of monocytes into the skin in both reporter and deficient mice. However, in contrast to similar disease severity between CX3CR1-deficient and reporter mice, CCR2-deficient mice developed significantly less disease than CCR2-reporter mice, as indicated by the percentage of affected area of ears. Collectively, our observations indicate that while CCR2 and CX3CR1 receptors are not involved in the recruitment of monocytes into the skin, CCR2 deficiency is associated with improved disease outcomes in experimental EBA in mice.",

The common bioluminescent reporter enzyme nanoluciferase (Nluc) is used to evaluate two different trapping chemistries, and impacts on the stability and catalytic performance of the enzyme are compared with controls involving free enzyme and enzyme electrostatically adsorbed to a pSiNP host without the use of trapping chemistry. The two chemistries exploited in this study are (1) oxidative trapping, where mild aqueous oxidation of the elemental silicon skeleton in the mesoporous silicon host swells and restructures the pore walls, physically trapping the Nluc payload in a porous SiO<sub>2</sub> matrix, and (2) calcium ion-induced condensation, where localized precipitation of calcium silicate entraps the Nluc protein in a porous silicate matrix. The two trapping chemistries form robust nanoscale cages with substantially smaller pores (9.8 ± 0.4 and 8.8 ± 0.3 nm, respectively) compared to the pSiNP starting material (15.3 ± 1.8 nm), such that the enzyme does not leach from the pSiNPs in aqueous buffer or under assay conditions. Enzyme stability is substantially improved using the two trapping chemistries; the caged materials retain 30-45% activity after heating to 80 °C for 30 min or when exposed to organic solvents; either of these denaturing conditions result in complete or near-complete loss of activity for the free enzyme or for enzyme that is electrostatically adsorbed to pSiNPs.

Evidence suggests tau functions as a prion, and cells and animals can efficiently propagate unique, transmissible tau pathologies. This suggests a dedicated cellular replication machinery, potentially reflecting a normal physiologic function for tau seeds. Consequently, we hypothesized that healthy control brains would contain seeding activity. We have recently developed a novel monoclonal antibody (MD3.1) specific for tau seeds. We used this antibody to immunopurify tau from the parietal and cerebellar cortices of 19 healthy subjects without any neuropathology, ranging 19 to 65 years. We detected seeding in lysates from the parietal cortex, but not in the cerebellum. We also detected no seeding in brain homogenates from wildtype or human tau knockin mice, suggesting that cellular/genetic context dictates development of seed-competent tau. Seeding did not correlate with subject age or brain tau levels. We confirmed our essential findings using an orthogonal assay, real-time quaking-induced conversion, which amplifies tau seeds in vitro. Dot blot analyses revealed no AT8 immunoreactivity above background levels in parietal and cerebellar extracts and ∼1/100 of that present in AD. Based on binding to a panel of antibodies, the conformational characteristics of control seeds differed from AD, suggesting a unique underlying assembly, or structural ensemble.

A donor plasmid DNA encoding an enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) flanked by a genomic fragment ranging from 66 bp to 878 bp including target 5'UTR was co-injected into fertilized eggs with a single guide RNA and Cas9 protein. Injections for krt12.2.L, myod1.S, sox2.L or brevican.S resulted in embryos expressing eGFP fluorescence in a tissue-specific manner, recapitulating endogenous expression of target genes. Integrations of the donor DNA into the target regions were examined by genotyping PCR for the eGFP-expressing embryos. The rate of embryos expressing the specific eGFP varied from 2.1% to 13.2% depending on the target locus and length of the genomic fragment in the donor plasmids.

Propofol-induced PKC activation in cells was estimated using the C kinase activity receptor (CKAR), an indicator of intracellular PKC activation. We also examined PKC translocation using isomers and derivatives of propofol to identify the crucial structural motifs involved in this process. <b>Key results:</b> Propofol persistently translocated PKCα conventional PKCs and PKCδ from novel PKCs (nPKCs) to the plasma membrane (PM). Propofol translocated PKCδ and PKCη of nPKCs to the Golgi apparatus and endoplasmic reticulum, respectively. Propofol also induced the nuclear translocation of PKCζ of atypical PKCs or proteins other than PKCs, such that the protein concentration inside and outside the nucleus became uniform. CKAR analysis revealed that propofol activated PKC in the PM and Golgi apparatus. Moreover, tests using isomers and derivatives of propofol predicted that the structural motifs important for the induction of PKC and nuclear translocation are different. <b>Conclusion and implications:</b> Propofol induced the subtype-specific intracellular translocation of PKCs and activated PKCs. Additionally, propofol induced the nuclear translocation of PKCs and other proteins, probably by altering the permeability of the nuclear envelope. Interestingly, propofol-induced PKC and nuclear translocation may occur via different mechanisms. Our findings provide insights into the action mechanisms of propofol.",

By inhibiting the initiation and elongation of the transcription, HpSGNi successfully silenced the transcription of exogenous fluorescent protein genes, ampicillin resistance gene and endogenous folP/sulA genes in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) and K-12 MG1655.

Nevertheless, TRPA1 has been implicated in other cell types including keratinocytes, epithelium, enterochromaffin cells, endothelium, astrocytes, and CNS neurons. Here, we developed a knock-in mouse that expresses the recombinase Flp<sub>O</sub> in TRPA1-expressing cells.

We observed tdTomato-expressing afferent fibers centrally (in the medulla and spinal cord) and peripherally in the esophagus, gut, airways, bladder, and skin. Furthermore, chemogenetic activation of TRPA1-expressing nerves in the paw evoked flinching behavior. tdTomato expression was very limited in other cell types. We found tdTomato in subepithelial cells in the gut mucosa but not in enterochromaffin cells. tdTomato was also observed in supporting cells within the cochlea, but not in hair cells. Lastly, tdTomato was occasionally observed in neurons in the somatomotor cortex and the piriform area, but not in astrocytes or vascular endothelium.

In this study, we performed a detailed assessment of the activity of locus coeruleus neurons and changes in noradrenergic transmission during acute hippocampal seizures evoked with perforant path stimulation, using state-of-the-art methodology. Action potentials of LC neurons, of which some were identified by means of optogenetics, were recorded in anesthetized rats using a multichannel high-density electrophysiology probe. The seizure-induced change in firing rate differed between LC neurons: 55% of neurons decreased in firing rate during seizures, while 28% increased their firing rate. Topographic analysis of multi-unit activity over the electrophysiology probe showed a topographic clustering of neurons that were inhibited or excited during seizures. Changes in hippocampal noradrenaline transmission during seizures were assessed using a fluorescent biosensor for noradrenaline, GRAB<sub>NE2m</sub>, in combination with fiber photometry, in both anesthetized and awake rats. Although our neuronal recordings indicated both inhibition and excitation of LC neurons during seizures, a consistent release of noradrenaline was observed. Concentrations of noradrenaline increased at seizure onset and decreased during or shortly after the seizure. In conclusion, this study showed consistent but heterogeneous modulation of LC neurons and a consistent time-locked release of hippocampal noradrenaline during acute hippocampal seizures.",

While sufficient for many studies, the extent of genetic manipulation possible with a single recombinase site is limiting and insufficient for more complex cell-based assays. Here, we harnessed two orthogonal Bxb1 recombinase sites to enable alternative avenues for using mammalian synthetic biology to characterize transgenic protein variants. By designing plasmids flanked by a second pair of auxiliary recombination sites, we demonstrate that we can avoid the genomic integration of undesirable bacterial DNA elements using the same starting cells engineered for whole-plasmid integration. We also created \"double landing pad\" cells simultaneously harboring two orthogonal Bxb1 recombinase sites at separate genomic loci, allowing complex cell-based genetic assays. Integration of a genetically encoded calcium indicator allowed for the real-time monitoring of intracellular calcium signaling dynamics, including kinetic perturbations that occur upon overexpression of the wild-type or variant version of the calcium signaling relay protein STIM1. A panel of missense mutants of the HIV-1 accessory protein Vif was paired with various paralogs within the human Apobec3 innate immune protein family to identify combinations capable or incapable of interacting within cells.

        "abstract": "Transgenic worms are a key resource for <i>C. elegans</i> researchers dissecting molecular pathways using this simple metazoan model system. Transgenes provide an avenue to visualize developmental events, cellular processes as well as real-time signal events in live animals using genetically encoded sensors. Generation of these tools has become increasingly efficient with the advent of numerous integration methods including transposon, CRISPR and recombinase-mediated integration. A growing limitation in transgene production is the assembly of the targeting constructs used to direct insertion of sequences into the genome. Here we present a toolkit that facilitates rapid assembly of complex reporters using a Golden Gate (GG) cloning-based approach. Co-assembly of one to eight DNA segments into an integration vector can be routinely obtained at high efficiency using a library of entry plasmids. The toolkit consists of 20 <i>SapI</i> GG entry vectors and 100 <i>SapI</i> GG insert plasmids containing a variety of promoters, FPs, tags, linkers, ORFs, 3' UTRs and numerous components for bipartite expression systems that can be mixed to create a huge repertoire of reporter constructs. The assembly process also works well with PCR products and 5' phosphorylated double stranded oligonucleotides, and such DNAs can be used to supply novel genes, promoters, and tags into the pipeline. In addition, the toolkit also provides a series of 12 empty <i>BsaI</i> -based GG assembly vectors that facilitate the construction of additional <i>SapI</i> GG plasmids containing novel inserts. A manual outlining the entire approach is provided as an appendix as well as a Microsoft® Excel based assembly tool which allows the user to choose individual inserts among the libraries of clones at each position in the assembly template and output an annotated sequence. The assembly process can easily be multiplexed and is typically over 90% efficient. The approach is sufficiently efficient to make microinjection rather than clone generation the limiting factor in transgene generation.",

The present regulatory toolboxes predominantly rely on the control and manipulation of carbon pathways. Nitrogen is an essential nutrient that plays a vital role in growth and metabolism. However, the availability of broadly applicable tools based on nitrogen pathways for metabolic regulation remains limited. In this work, we present a novel regulatory system that harnesses signals associated with nitrogen metabolism to redirect excess carbon flux in Bacillus licheniformis. By engineering the native transcription factor GlnR and incorporating a sorbitol-responsive element, we achieved a remarkable 99% inhibition of the expression of the green fluorescent protein reporter gene. Leveraging this system, we identified the optimal redirection point for the overflow carbon flux, resulting in a substantial 79.5% reduction in acetoin accumulation and a 2.6-fold increase in acetate production.

        "abstract": "The recent increase in the use of nicotine products by teenagers has revealed an urgent need to better understand the impact of nicotine on the adolescent brain. Here, we sought to examine the actions of extracellular ATP as a neurotransmitter and to investigate whether ATP and nicotinic signaling interact during adolescence. With the GRAB<sub>ATP</sub> (G-protein-coupled receptor activation-based ATP sensor), we first demonstrated that nicotine induces extracellular ATP release in the medial habenula, a brain region involved in nicotine aversion and withdrawal. Using patch-clamp electrophysiology, we then demonstrated that activation of the ATP receptors P2X or P2Y<sub>1</sub> increases the neuronal firing of cholinergic neurons. Surprisingly, contrasting interactive effects were observed with nicotine exposure. For the P2X receptor, activation had no observable effect on acute nicotine-mediated activity, but during abstinence after 10 d of nicotine exposure, coexposure to nicotine and the P2X agonist potentiated neuronal activity in female, but not male, neurons. For P2Y<sub>1</sub> signaling, a potentiated effect of the agonist and nicotine was observed with acute exposure, but not following extended nicotine exposure. These data reveal a complex interactive effect between nicotinic and ATP signaling in the adolescent brain and provide mechanistic insights into extracellular ATP signaling with sex-specific alterations of neuronal responses based on prior drug exposure.<b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> In these studies, it was discovered that nicotine induces extracellular ATP release in the medial habenula and subsequent activation of the ATP purinergic receptors increases habenular cholinergic neuronal firing in the adolescent brain. Interestingly, following extended nicotine exposure, nicotine was found to alter the interplay between purinergic and nicotinic signaling in a sex-specific manner. Together, these studies provide a novel understanding for the role of extracellular ATP in mediating habenular activity and reveal how nicotine exposure during adolescence alters these signaling mechanisms, which has important implications given the high incidence of e-cigarette/vape use by youth.",

        "abstract": "Human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), with their ability to generate human neural cells (astrocytes and neurons) from patients, hold great promise for understanding the pathophysiology of major neuropsychiatric diseases such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorders, which includes alterations in cerebral development. Indeed, the <i>in vitro</i> neurodifferentiation of iPSCs, while recapitulating certain major stages of neurodevelopment <i>in vivo</i>, makes it possible to obtain networks of living human neurons. The culture model presented is particularly attractive within this framework since it involves iPSC-derived neural cells, which more specifically differentiate into cortical neurons of diverse types (in particular glutamatergic and GABAergic) and astrocytes. However, these <i>in vitro</i> neuronal networks, which may be heterogeneous in their degree of differentiation, remain challenging to bring to an appropriate level of maturation. It is therefore necessary to develop tools capable of analyzing a large number of cells to assess this maturation process. Calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) imaging, which has been extensively developed, undoubtedly offers an incredibly good approach, particularly in its versions using genetically encoded calcium indicators. However, in the context of these iPSC-derived neural cell cultures, there is a lack of studies that propose Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging methods that can finely characterize the evolution of neuronal maturation during the neurodifferentiation process. In this study, we propose a robust and reliable method for specifically measuring neuronal activity at two different time points of the neurodifferentiation process in such human neural cultures. To this end, we have developed a specific Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal analysis procedure and tested a series of different AAV serotypes to obtain expression levels of GCaMP6f under the control of the neuron-specific human synapsin1 (hSyn) promoter. The retro serotype has been found to be the most efficient in driving the expression of the GCaMP6f and is compatible with multi-time point neuronal Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging in our human iPSC-derived neural cultures. An AAV2/retro carrying GCaMP6f under the hSyn promoter (AAV2/retro-hSyn-GCaMP6f) is an efficient vector that we have identified. To establish the method, calcium measurements were carried out at two time points in the neurodifferentiation process with both hSyn and CAG promoters, the latter being known to provide high transient gene expression across various cell types. Our results stress that this methodology involving AAV2/retro-hSyn-GCaMP6f is suitable for specifically measuring neuronal calcium activities over multiple time points and is compatible with the neurodifferentiation process in our mixed human neural cultures.",

Upon the stimulation-induced triggering of calcium transients, a single producer cell discharges PGE<sub>2</sub> to stimulate PKA in the surrounding reporter cells. Due to the flow of the medium, the PKA-activated area exhibited a comet-like smear when HeLa cells were used. In contrast, radial PKA activation was observed when confluent MDCK cells were used, indicating that PGE<sub>2</sub> diffusion was restricted to the basolateral space. By fitting the radius of the PKA-activated area to a simulation model based on simple diffusion, we estimated that a single HeLa cell secretes 0.25 fmol PGE<sub>2</sub> upon a single calcium transient to activate PKA in more than 1000 neighboring cells.

Whether these fetal cells are beneficial or detrimental to maternal health is unknown. This study aimed to characterize fetal microchimeric immune cells in the maternal heart during pregnancy and postpartum, and to identify differences in these fetal microchimeric subpopulations between normal and pregnancies complicated by spontaneous preterm induced by ascending infection. <b>Methods:</b> A Cre reporter mouse model, which when mated with wild-type C57BL/6J females resulted in cells and tissues of progeny expressing red fluorescent protein tandem dimer Tomato (mT+), was used to detect fetal microchimeric cells. On embryonic day (E)15, 10<sup>4</sup> colony-forming units (CFU) <i>E. coli</i> was administered intravaginally to mimic ascending infection, with delivery on or before E18.5 considered as preterm delivery. A subset of pregnant mice was sacrificed at E16 and postpartum day 28 to harvest maternal hearts. Heart tissues were processed for immunofluorescence microscopy and high-dimensional mass cytometry by time-of-flight (CyTOF) using an antibody panel of immune cell markers. Changes in cardiac physiologic parameters were measured up to 60 days postpartum via two-dimensional echocardiography. <b>Results:</b> Intravaginal <i>E. coli</i> administration resulted in preterm delivery of live pups in 70% of the cases. mT + expressing cells were detected in maternal uterus and heart, implying that fetal cells can migrate to different maternal compartments. During ascending infection, more fetal antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and less fetal hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and fetal double-positive (DP) thymocytes were observed in maternal hearts at E16 compared to normal pregnancy. These HSCs were cleared while DP thymocytes persisted 28 days postpartum following an ascending infection. No significant changes in cardiac physiologic parameters were observed postpartum except a trend in lowering the ejection fraction rate in preterm delivered mothers. <b>Conclusion:</b> Both normal pregnancy and ascending infection revealed distinct compositions of fetal microchimeric immune cells within the maternal heart, which could potentially influence the maternal cardiac microenvironment via (1) modulation of cardiac reverse modeling processes by fetal stem cells, and (2) differential responses to recognition of fetal APCs by maternal T cells.",

Nevertheless, poultry mRNA vaccination could prove to be very interesting due to the relatively low production cost, especially true when using self-amplifying mRNA (saRNA), and their extreme adaptability to new pathogens. The latter could be particularly useful when new pathogens join the stage or new variants arise. As a first step toward the investigation of saRNA vaccines in poultry, this study evaluates a luciferase-encoding saRNA in avian tracheal explants, conjunctival explants, primary chicken cecal cells and 18-day embryonated eggs. Naked saRNA in combination with RNase inhibitor and 2 different lipid-based formulations, that is, ionizable lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) and Lipofectamine Messenger Max, were evaluated. The saRNA-LNP formulation led to the highest bioluminescent signal in the tracheal explants, conjunctival explants and cecal cell cultures. A dose-response experiment with these saRNA-LNPs (33-900 ng/well) in these avian organoids and cells showed a nonlinear dose-response relationship. After in ovo administration, the highest dose of the saRNA-LNPs (5 µg) resulted in a visual expression as a weak bioluminescence signal could be seen. The other delivery approaches did not lead to a visual saRNA expression in the embryos. In conclusion, effective entry of saRNA encapsulated in LNPs followed by successful saRNA translation in poultry was established.

        "abstract": "Increased brain levels of acetylcholine (ACh) are observed in subsets of patients with depression and increasing ACh levels chronically can precipitate stress-related behaviors in humans and animals. Conversely, optimal ACh levels are required for cognition and memory. We hypothesize that ACh signaling is important for encoding both appetitive and stress-relevant memories, but that excessive increases in ACh result in a negative encoding bias in which memory formation of a stressful event is aberrantly strengthened, potentially contributing to the excessive focus on negative experience that could lead to depressive symptoms. The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is critical to control the limbic system to filter exteroceptive cues and stress-related circuits. We therefore evaluated the role of ACh signaling in the mPFC in a learned helplessness task in which mice were exposed to repeated inescapable stressors followed by an active avoidance task. Using fiber photometry with a genetically-encoded ACh sensor, we found that ACh levels in the mPFC during exposure to inescapable stressors were positively correlated with later escape deficits in an active avoidance test in males, but not females. Consistent with these measurements, we found that both pharmacologically- and chemogenetically-induced increases in mPFC ACh levels resulted in escape deficits in both male and female mice, whereas chemogenetic inhibition of ACh neurons projecting to the mPFC improved escape performance in males, but impaired escape performance in females. These results highlight the adaptive role of ACh release in stress response, but also support the idea that sustained elevated ACh levels contribute to maladaptive behaviors. Furthermore, mPFC ACh signaling may contribute to depressive symptomology differentially in males and females.",

        "abstract": "Cyanobacteria show an unusually complex prokaryotic cell structure including a distinct intracytoplasmic membrane system, the thylakoid membranes that are the site of the photosynthetic light reactions. The thylakoid and plasma membranes have sharply distinct proteomes, but the mechanisms that target proteins to a specific membrane remain poorly understood. Here, we investigate the locations of translation of thylakoid and plasma membrane proteins in the model unicellular cyanobacterium <i>Synechococcus elongatus</i> PCC 7942. We use fluorescent <i>in situ</i> hybridization to probe the locations of mRNAs encoding membrane-integral proteins, plus Green Fluorescent Protein tagging of the RplL subunit to reveal the location of ribosomes under different conditions. We show that membrane-integral thylakoid and plasma membrane proteins are translated in different locations. Thylakoid membrane proteins are translated in patches at the innermost thylakoid membrane surface facing the nucleoid. However, different proteins are translated in different patches, even when they are subunits of the same multiprotein complex. This implies that translation is distributed over the proximal thylakoid surface, with newly inserted proteins migrating within the membrane prior to incorporation into complexes. mRNAs encoding plasma membrane proteins form patches at the plasma membrane. Ribosomes can be observed at similar locations near the thylakoid and plasma membranes, with more ribosomes near the plasma membrane when conditions force rapid production of plasma membrane proteins. There must be routes for ribosomes and mRNAs past the thylakoids to the plasma membrane. We infer a system to chaperone plasma membrane mRNAs to prevent their translation prior to arrival at the correct membrane. IMPORTANCE Cyanobacteria have a complex and distinct membrane system within the cytoplasm, the thylakoid membranes that house the photosynthetic light reactions. The thylakoid and plasma membranes contain distinct sets of proteins, but the steps that target proteins to the two membranes remain unclear. Knowledge of the protein sorting rules will be crucial for the biotechnological re-engineering of cyanobacterial cells, and for understanding the evolutionary development of the thylakoids. Here, we probe the subcellular locations of the mRNAs that encode cyanobacterial membrane proteins and the ribosomes that translate them. We show that thylakoid and plasma membrane proteins are produced at different locations, providing the first direct evidence for a sorting mechanism that operates prior to protein translation.",

Oxytocin modulates maternal behavior by binding to oxytocin receptors (OXTRs) in various parts of the brain. Previously, we showed that OXTRs are expressed in the anteroventral periventricular nucleus (AVPV) of female, but not male mice. Because the AVPV is involved in the regulation of maternal behavior and oxytocin enhances its induction, this finding leads to the hypothesis that the female specific population of OXTR neurons in the AVPV regulates maternal behavior. To address this hypothesis, OXTR-Venus reporter mice were used to assess if expression levels of OXTR in the AVPV are changed during the postpartum period. The total number of OXTR-Venus neurons was significantly greater in postpartum dams compared to virgin females. To assess efferent projections of the AVPV-OXTR neurons, a Cre-dependent fluorescent protein (tdTomato) expressing a viral vector was injected into one side of the AVPV of female OXTR-Cre mice. Fibers expressing tdTomato were found in hypothalamic areas containing oxytocin neurons (the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei) and the midbrain areas (the ventral tegmental area and periaqueductal gray) that are involved in the regulation of maternal motivation. To assess if activity of the AVPV-OXTR neurons is involved in the regulation of maternal behaviors, a chemogenetic approach was employed. Specific inhibition of activity of AVPV-OXTR neurons completely abolished pup retrieval and nest building behaviors. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that AVPV-OXTR neurons in postpartum female mice constitute an important node in the neural circuitry that regulates maternal behavior.",

We previously found that the knockout (KO) of autophagy-related 5 (Atg5), which is essential for autophagy, leads to the malignant transformation of NIH 3T3 cells. In this study, we explored the mechanism by which autophagy contributes to this malignant transformation using two transformed cell lines, Atg5 KO and Ras-NIH 3T3. Monomeric red fluorescent protein-green fluorescent protein-light chain 3 reporter and Cyto-ID staining revealed that Ras-NIH 3T3 cells exhibited higher basal autophagy activity than NIH 3T3 cells. Additionally, transformed cells, regardless of their Atg5 KO status, were more sensitive to autophagy inhibitors (SBI-0206965, chloroquine, and obatoclax) than the untransformed NIH 3T3 cells, suggesting that the transformed cells are more autophagy-dependent than the normal cells. Loss of Atg5 improved the cell viability and mobility, especially in Ras-NIH 3T3 cells. Furthermore, we discovered that autophagy was alternatively induced in a Rab9-dependent manner in Ras-NIH 3T3 and NIH 3T3/Atg5 KO cells. In particular, Atg5 KO cells showed reduced mTOR-mediated phosphorylation of Akt (pAkt S473), indicating the mTOR-independent occurrence of alternative autophagy in Atg5 KO cells. Therefore, our study provides evidence that alternative autophagy may contribute to tumorigenesis in cells with an impaired Atg5-dependent autophagy pathway.

Here, we report a chemically defined, xeno-free culture system for culturing and deriving monkey PSCs in vitro. The cells display global gene expression and genome-wide hypomethylation patterns distinct from monkey-primed cells. We also found expression of signaling pathways components that may increase the potential for chimera formation. Crucially for biomedical applications, we were also able to integrate bioluminescent reporter genes into monkey PSCs and track them in chimeric embryos in vivo and in vitro. The engineered cells retained embryonic and extra-embryonic developmental potential.

Considering the protein production exhibited by these species, we searched for robust promoters in Geobacillus kaustophilus HTA426. Transcriptome data revealed that several genes were highly expressed during the proliferative phase; their promoters were characterized using reporter assays with Venus fluorescent protein (VFP). The results suggested that the cspD promoter (P<sub>cspD</sub>) directed robust vfp expression at 60°C in G. kaustophilus. Although cspD potentially encodes a cold-shock protein, P<sub>cspD</sub> functioned at elevated temperatures. The promoter strongly functioned even in Escherichia coli; this prevented the cloning of some genes (e.g., vfp) downstream of it on a plasmid vector via E. coli-based genetic manipulation. Consequently, we generated a mutated P<sub>cspD</sub> that functioned inefficiently in E. coli and constructed the pGKE124 plasmid using the mutant promoter. The plasmid could carry vfp in E. coli and afford the production of VFP in G. kaustophilus at a yield of 390 mg/L. pGKE124 directed a similar production in other thermophilic species; the highest yield was observed in Geobacillus thermodenitrificans K1041. Several proteins could be produced using a system involving G. thermodenitrificans K1041 and pGKE124. Notably, the extracellular production of xylanase at a yield of 1 g/L was achieved using this system. Although the leaky production of nonsecretory proteins was observed, we developed a simple process to collectively purify recombinant proteins from the intracellular and extracellular fractions. The findings presented there propose an effective host-vector system for the production of recombinant proteins at elevated temperatures.

Polypropylene (PP) capillary-channeled polymer (C-CP) fiber columns are modified with the biotin-binding protein streptavidin (SAV) to capture biotinylated proteins. The loading characteristics of SAV on fiber supports were determined using breakthrough curves and frontal analysis. Based on adsorption data, a 3-min on-column loading at a flow rate of 0.5 mL min<sup>-1</sup> (295.2 cm h<sup>-1</sup>) with a SAV feed concentration of 0.5 mg mL<sup>-1</sup> produces a SAV loading capacity of 1.4 mg g<sup>-1</sup> fiber. SAV has an incredibly high affinity for the small-molecule biotin (10<sup>-14</sup> M), such that this binding relationship can be exploited by labeling a target protein with biotin via an Avi-tag. To evaluate the capture of the biotinylated proteins on the modified PP surface, the biotinylated versions of bovine serum albumin (b-BSA) and green fluorescent protein (b-GFP) were utilized as probe species. The loading buffer composition and flow rate were optimized towards protein capture. The non-ionic detergent Tween-20 was added to the deposition solutions to minimize non-specific binding. Values of 0.25-0.50% (v/v) Tween-20 in PBS exhibited better capture efficiency, while minimizing the non-specific binding for b-BSA and b-GFP, respectively.

In this study, we employed a dual-reporter system consisting of bioluminescent Gaussia luciferase and fluorescent proteins to investigate the dynamics and regulation of exosome secretion in cultured human cells. Our results demonstrated that the engineered dual-reporters effectively monitored both exosome-mediated and ER-Golgi-mediated secretory pathways in a specific and quantitative manner. Notably, we observed distinct characteristics of exosome-mediated protein secretion, including significantly lower capacity and different dynamics compared to the ER-Golgi pathway. This phenomenon was observed in human kidney 293T cells and liver HepG2 cells, emphasizing the conserved nature of exosome-mediated secretion across cell types. Furthermore, we investigated the impact of brefeldin A (BFA), an inhibitor of ER-to-Golgi membrane trafficking, on protein secretion. Interestingly, BFA inhibited protein secretion via the ER-Golgi pathway while stimulating exosome-mediated protein secretion under same experimental conditions. Collectively, our study highlights the utility of the dual-reporter system for real-time monitoring and quantitative analysis of protein secretion through conventional ER-Golgi and unconventional exosome pathways.

CRISPR whole-genome screens can be used to rapidly discover host factors that contribute to or impair viral entry. However, when using live viruses and cellular lethality for selection, these screens can identify an overwhelming number of genes without specificity for the stage of the viral infection cycle. New screening methods are needed to identify host machinery contributing to specific steps of viral infection. Here, we developed a CRISPR whole-genome screen and counter-screen strategy based on a pseudoviral platform that allowed identification of genes specific to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike and vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV-G) mediated entry. Screening of SARS-CoV-2 spike and VSV-G on the same lentiviral pseudovirus allowed the identification of entry-specific genes relative to genes associated with retro-transcription, integration, and reporter expression from the lentiviral pseudovirus. Second, a Cre-Gag fusion protein packaged into the pseudovirus was used to bypass retro-transcription and integration by directly activating a floxed fluorescent protein reporter upon entry  reduced the number of gene hits and increase specificity for viral entry. Our approach correctly identified SARS-CoV-2 and VSV-G receptors ACE2 and low-density lipoprotein receptors, respectively, and distinguished genes associated with retroviral reporter expression from envelope-mediated entry. Moreover, the CRE-Gag fusion/flox reporter increased the screen specificity for viral entry-associated genes. Validation of a few hits demonstrates that this approach distinguishes envelope-specific host factors from genes affecting reporter expression. Overall, this approach provides a new strategy for identifying host genes influencing viral entry without the confounding complexity of live-viral screens which produce long gene lists associated with all aspects of viral pathogenesis and replication.",

Also, determining where the neuron's cell body ends and where the axons and dendrites begin is taxing.

        "abstract": "A better understanding of HIV-1 latency is a research priority in HIV cure research. Conversely, little is known about the latency characteristics of HIV-2, the closely related human lentivirus. Though both viruses cause AIDS, HIV-2 infection progresses more slowly with significantly lower viral loads, even when corrected for CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell counts. Hence a direct comparison of latency characteristics between HIV-1 and HIV-2 could provide important clues towards a functional cure. Transduction of SupT1 cells with single-round HIV-1 and HIV-2 viruses with an enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) reporter showed higher levels of eGFP expression for HIV-2 than HIV-1, while HIV-1 expression appeared more cytotoxic. To compare HIV-1 and HIV-2 gene expression, latency and reactivation in more detail, we have generated HIV-2 OGH, a replication deficient, near full- length, double reporter virus that discriminates latently and productively infected cells in cell culture. This construct is based on HIV-1 OGH, and to our knowledge, first of its kind for HIV-2. Using this construct we have observed a higher eGFP expression for HIV-2, but higher losses of HIV-1 transduced cells in SupT1 and Jurkat cells and a reduced sensitivity of HIV-2 for reactivation with TNF-α. In addition, we have analysed HIV-2 integration sites and their epigenetic environment. HIV-1 and HIV-2 share a preference for actively transcribed genes in gene-dense regions and favor active chromatin marks while disfavoring methylation markers associated with heterochromatin. In conclusion the HIV-2 OGH construct provides an interesting tool for studying HIV-2 expression, latency and reactivation. As simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) and HIV-2 have been proposed to model a functional HIV cure, a better understanding of the mechanisms governing HIV-2 and SIV latency will be important to move forward. Further research is needed to investigate if HIV-2 uses similar mechanisms as HIV-1 to achieve its integration site selectivity.",

This protocol describes murine models of acute T. gondii infection, toxoplasmic encephalitis and toxoplasma retinochoroiditis. T. gondii infection in severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice, deficient in T and B cells, has allowed for the study of T cell-independent mechanisms of defense against intracellular organisms, as described here. The uracil auxotroph strain cps1-1 and temperature-sensitive mutant strains of T. gondii induce protection against challenge with virulent strains of the parasite. They have allowed studies of immunization and adoptive-transfer experiments. A protocol is provided for infection with these mutant strains. The EGS strain of T. gondii has the unique feature of spontaneously forming tissue cysts in cell culture. Dual fluorescent reporter stains of this strain have allowed the study of tachyzoite to bradyzoite transitions in vitro and in vivo. A protocol for in vitro and in vivo growth of this strain and tissue cyst isolation is provided. Genetic manipulation of T. gondii and mice has led to the development of parasites that express fluorescent proteins as well as mice with fluorescently labeled leukocytes. This together with the use of T. gondii that express model antigens and transgenic mice that express the appropriate T cell receptor have facilitated the in vivo study of parasite host-interaction. In addition, parasites that express bioluminescent markers have made it possible to study the dynamics of infection in real time using bioluminescence imaging.

Here we constructed a hypoxia-inducible promoter library for P. pastoris through error-prone PCR of Pichia stipitis ADH2 promoter (Ps<sub>ADH2</sub>). The library of 30 selected promoters showing 0.4- to 5.5-fold of the Ps<sub>ADH2</sub> activity was obtained through high-throughput screening in microplates using the reporter yeast-enhanced green fluorescent protein. Two strong promoters, AM23 and AM30, were further characterized in shake flask cultures at high and low dissolved oxygen levels. They responded more sensitively to the low dissolved oxygen level, achieving a 4.6-, 7.9-fold and 3.6-, 7.7-fold higher fluorescence intensity and transcript level, respectively, than the wild-type Ps<sub>ADH2</sub>. Their hypoxia-inducible properties were confirmed with two additional reporters: β-galactosidase and Vitreoscilla hemoglobin, to demonstrate the broad applicability of the promoter library. During the typical fermentation process in shake flasks, the promoter AM30 showed strong expression with cell growth and decreased oxygen levels, without any additional chemical inducers or operations. Since the potent industrial host P. pastoris is recognized as an easy to scale-up system, it is reasonable to expect that the obtained hypoxia-inducible promoter library may have great potential to enable convenient regulation of gene expression under industrial fermentations which are usually run under oxygen limitation due to high cell density cultivations.",

        "abstract": "Volatile anesthetics alter presynaptic function through effects on Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and neurotransmitter release. These actions are proposed to play important roles in their pleiotropic neurophysiological effects including immobility, unconsciousness and amnesia. Nitric oxide and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (NO/cGMP) signaling has been implicated in presynaptic mechanisms, and disruption of NO/cGMP signaling has been shown to alter sensitivity to volatile anesthetics in vivo. We investigated volatile anesthetic actions NO/cGMP signaling in relation to presynaptic function in cultured rat hippocampal neurons using pharmacological tools and genetically encoded biosensors and sequestering probes of cGMP levels. Using the fluorescent cGMP biosensor cGull, we found that electrical stimulation-evoked NMDA-type glutamate receptor-independent presynaptic cGMP transients were inhibited 33.2% by isoflurane (0.51 mM) and 26.4% by sevoflurane (0.57 mM) (p < 0.0001) compared to control stimulation without anesthetic. Stimulation-evoked cGMP transients were blocked by the nonselective inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase N-ω-nitro-l-arginine, but not by the selective neuronal nitric oxide synthase inhibitor N5-(1-imino-3-butenyl)-l-ornithine. Isoflurane and sevoflurane inhibition of stimulation-evoked increases in presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration, measured with synaptophysin-GCaMP6f, and of synaptic vesicle exocytosis, measured with synaptophysin-pHlourin, was attenuated in neurons expressing the cGMP scavenger protein sponge (inhibition of exocytosis reduced by 54% for isoflurane and by 53% for sevoflurane). The anesthetic-induced reduction in presynaptic excitability was partially occluded by inhibition of HCN channels, a cGMP-modulated excitatory ion channel that can facilitate glutamate release. We propose that volatile anesthetics depress presynaptic cGMP signaling and downstream effectors like HCN channels that are essential to presynaptic function and excitability. These findings identify novel mechanisms by which volatile anesthetics depress synaptic transmission via second messenger signaling involving the NO/cGMP pathway in hippocampal neurons.",

        "abstract": "Previously, we developed an infectious hepatitis E virus (HEV) harboring the nanoKAZ gene in the hypervariable region of the open reading frame 1 (ORF1) of the HEV3b (JE03-1760F/P10) genome and demonstrated the usefulness for screening anti-HEV drugs that inhibit the early infection process. In the present study, we constructed another reporter HEV (HEV3b-HiBiT) by placing a minimized HiBiT tag derived from NanoLuc luciferase at the 3'-end of the viral capsid (ORF2) coding sequence. It replicated efficiently in PLC/PRF/5 cells, produced membrane-associated particles identical to those of the parental virus, and was genetically stable and infectious. The HiBiT tag was fused to both secreted ORF2s (ORF2s-HiBiT) and ORF2c capsid protein (ORF2c-HiBiT). The ORF2c-HiBiT formed membrane-associated HEV particles (eHEV3b-HiBiT). By treating these particles with digitonin, we demonstrated that the HiBiT tag was expressed on the surface of capsid and was present inside the lipid membrane. To simplify the measurement of luciferase activity and provide a more convenient screening platform, we constructed an ORF2s-defective mutant (HEV3b-HiBiT/ΔORF2s) in which the secreted ORF2s are suppressed. We used this system to evaluate the effects of introducing small interfering RNAs and treatment with an inhibitor or accelerator of exosomal release on HEV egress and demonstrated that the effects on virus release can readily be analyzed. Therefore, HEV3b-HiBiT and HEV3b-HiBiT/ΔORF2s reporters may be useful for investigating the virus life cycle and can serve as a more convenient screening platform to search for candidate drugs targeting the late stage of HEV infection such as particle formation and release. IMPORTANCE The construction of recombinant infectious viruses harboring a stable luminescence reporter gene is essential for investigations of the viral life cycle, such as viral replication and pathogenesis, and the development of novel antiviral drugs. However, it is difficult to maintain the stability of a large foreign gene inserted into the viral genome. In the present study, we successfully generated a recombinant HEV harboring the 11-amino acid HiBiT tag in the ORF2 coding region and demonstrated the infectivity, efficient virus growth, particle morphology, and genetic stability, suggesting that this recombinant HEV is useful for <i>in vitro</i> assays. Furthermore, this system can serve as a more convenient screening platform for anti-HEV drugs. Thus, an infectious recombinant HEV is a powerful approach not only for elucidating the molecular mechanisms of the viral life cycle but also for the screening and development of novel antiviral agents.",

Reversible gene therapy using long-lived chemogenetic approaches is an appealing option. We used the genetically activated chloride channel PSAM<sup>4</sup>-GlyR to examine pain pathways in mice. Using recombinant AAV9-based delivery to sensory neurons, we found a reversal of acute pain behavior and diminished neuronal activity using <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> GCaMP imaging on activation of PSAM<sup>4</sup>-GlyR with varenicline. A significant reduction in inflammatory heat hyperalgesia and oxaliplatin-induced cold allodynia was also observed. Importantly, there was no impairment of motor coordination, but innocuous von Frey sensation was inhibited. We generated a transgenic mouse that expresses a CAG-driven FLExed PSAM<sup>4</sup>-GlyR downstream of the <i>Rosa26</i> locus that requires Cre recombinase to enable the expression of PSAM<sup>4</sup>-GlyR and tdTomato. We used Na<sub>V</sub>1.8 Cre to examine the role of predominantly nociceptive Na<sub>V</sub>1.8+ neurons in cancer-induced bone pain (CIBP) and neuropathic pain caused by chronic constriction injury (CCI). Varenicline activation of PSAM<sup>4</sup>-GlyR in Na<sub>V</sub>1.8-positive neurons reversed CCI-driven mechanical, thermal, and cold sensitivity. Additionally, varenicline treatment of mice with CIBP expressing PSAM<sup>4</sup>-GlyR in Na<sub>V</sub>1.8+ sensory neurons reversed cancer pain as assessed by weight-bearing. Moreover, when these mice were subjected to acute pain assays, an elevation in withdrawal thresholds to noxious mechanical and thermal stimuli was detected, but innocuous mechanical sensations remained unaffected.

        "abstract": "Type 2 ryanodine receptor (RyR2) is a Ca<sup>2+</sup> release channel on the endoplasmic (ER)/sarcoplasmic reticulum that plays a central role in the excitation-contraction coupling in the heart. Hyperactivity of RyR2 has been linked to ventricular arrhythmias in patients with catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia and heart failure, where spontaneous Ca<sup>2+</sup> release via hyperactivated RyR2 depolarizes diastolic membrane potential to induce triggered activity. In such cases, drugs that suppress RyR2 activity are expected to prevent the arrhythmias, but there is no clinically available RyR2 inhibitors at present. In this study, we searched for RyR2 inhibitors from a well-characterized compound library using a recently developed ER Ca<sup>2+</sup>-based assay, where the inhibition of RyR2 activity was detected by the increase in ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals from R-CEPIA1er, a genetically encoded ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator, in RyR2-expressing HEK293 cells. By screening 1535 compounds in the library, we identified three compounds (chloroxylenol, methyl orsellinate, and riluzole) that greatly increased the ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal. All of the three compounds suppressed spontaneous Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations in RyR2-expressing HEK293 cells and correspondingly reduced the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent [<sup>3</sup>H]ryanodine binding activity. In cardiomyocytes from RyR2-mutant mice, the three compounds effectively suppressed abnormal Ca<sup>2+</sup> waves without substantial effects on the action-potential-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients. These results confirm that ER Ca<sup>2+</sup>-based screening is useful for identifying modulators of ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> release channels and suggest that RyR2 inhibitors have potential to be developed as a new category of antiarrhythmic drugs. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: We successfully identified three compounds having RyR2 inhibitory action from a well-characterized compound library using an endoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup>-based assay, and demonstrated that these compounds suppressed arrhythmogenic Ca<sup>2+</sup> wave generation without substantially affecting physiological action-potential induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in cardiomyocytes.

In a previous work, we have adapted to an animal system, Drosophila melanogaster, genetically encoded metabolic FRET-based sensors that had been previously developed in single-cell systems. These sensors provide semi-quantitative data on the stationary concentrations of key metabolites of the bioenergetic metabolism: lactate, pyruvate, and 2-oxoglutarate. The use of these sensors in intact organs required the development of an image processing method that minimizes the contribution of spatially complex autofluorescence patterns, that would obscure the FRET signals.

We have reported the construction of a DNA-launched replicon of the Asian-lineage Natal RGN strain and the production of single-round infectious particles (SRIPs) via the combination of prM/E virus-like particles with the replicon. The main objective of the study was to engineer the ZIKV replicon as mammalian expression vectors and evaluate the potential of ZIKV mini-replicon-based SRIPs as delivery vehicles for heterologous gene expression in vitro and in vivo. The mini-replicons contained various genetic elements, including NS4B, an NS5 methyltransferase (MTase) domain, and an NS5 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) domain. Among these mini-replicons, only ZIKV mini-replicons 2 and 3, which contained the full NS5 and NS4B-NS5 genetic elements, respectively, exhibited the expression of reporters (green fluorescent protein (GFP) and cyan fluorescent protein-yellow fluorescent fusion protein (CYP)) and generated self-replicating RNAs. When the mini-replicons were transfected into the cells expressing ZIKV prM/E, this led to the production of ZIKV mini-replicon-based SRIPs. ZIKV mini-replicon 3 SRIPs showed a significantly higher yield titer and a greater abundance of self-replicating replicon RNAs when compared to ZIKV mini-replicon 2 SRIPs. Additionally, there were disparities in the dynamics of CYP expression and cytotoxic effects observed in various infected cell types between ZIKV mini-replicon 2-CYP and 3-CYP SRIPs. In particular, ZIKV mini-replicon 3-CYP SRIPs led to a substantial decrease in the survival rates of infected cells at a MOI of 2. An in vivo gene expression assay indicated that hACE2 expression was detected in the lung and brain tissues of mice following the intravenous administration of ZIKV mini-replicon 3-hACE2 SRIPs.

Our results show frequent mosaicism, inconsistent recombination activity, and parent-of-origin effects in placentas from Cyp19-Cre;ROSA<sup>mT/mG</sup> mice, suggesting that tail-biopsy genotype results may not necessarily indicate the excision of floxed genes in Cyp19-Cre positive placentas.

This vector has high therapeutic versatility with the ability to deliver genetic payloads to a variety of human tissue types, yet there is currently a lack of transgene expression control once the virus is administered. There are also times when transgene expression is too low for the desired therapeutic outcome, necessitating high viral dose administration resulting in possible immunological complications. Herein, we validate a chemically controllable AAV transgene expression technology <i>in vitro</i> that utilizes bifunctional molecules known as chemical epigenetic modifiers (CEMs). These compounds employ endogenous epigenetic machinery to specifically enhance transgene expression of episomal DNA. A recombinant AAV (rAAV) was designed to both deliver the reporter transgene as well as deliver a synthetic zinc finger (ZFs) protein fused to FK506 binding protein (FKBP). These synthetic ZFs target a DNA-binding array sequence upstream of the promoter expressing the AAV transgene to specifically enhance AAV transgene expression in the presence of a CEM. The transcriptional activating compound CEM87 functions by recruiting the epigenetic transcription activator bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4), increasing AAV transgene activity up to fivefold in a dose-dependent manner in HEK293T cells. The highest levels of transgene product activity are seen 24 h following CEM87 treatment. Additionally, the CEM87-mediated enhancement of different transgene products with either Luciferase or green fluorescent protein (GFP) was observed in multiple cell lines and enhancement of transgene expression was capsid serotype independent. The impact of CEM87 activity can be disrupted through drug removal or chemical recruitment site competition with FK506, thus demonstrating the reversibility of the impact of CEM87 on transgene expression.

        "abstract": "Chemogenetic tools provide an opportunity to manipulate neuronal activity and behavior selectively and repeatedly in nonhuman primates (NHPs) with minimal invasiveness. Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs) are one example that is based on mutated muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. Another channel-based chemogenetic system available for neuronal modulation in NHPs uses pharmacologically selective actuator modules (PSAMs), which are selectively activated by pharmacologically selective effector molecules (PSEMs). To facilitate the use of the PSAM/PSEM system, the selection and dosage of PSEMs should be validated and optimized for NHPs. To this end, we used a multimodal imaging approach. We virally expressed excitatory PSAM (PSAM4-5HT3) in the striatum and the primary motor cortex (M1) of two male macaque monkeys, and visualized its location through positron emission tomography (PET) with the reporter ligand [<sup>18</sup>F]ASEM. Chemogenetic excitability of neurons triggered by two PSEMs (uPSEM817 and uPSEM792) was evaluated using [<sup>18</sup>F]fluorodeoxyglucose-PET imaging, with uPSEM817 being more efficient than uPSEM792. Pharmacological magnetic resonance imaging (phMRI) showed that increased brain activity in the PSAM4-expressing region began ∼13 min after uPSEM817 administration and continued for at least 60 min. Our multimodal imaging data provide valuable information regarding the manipulation of neuronal activity using the PSAM/PSEM system in NHPs, facilitating future applications.<b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Like other chemogenetic tools, the ion channel-based system called pharmacologically selective actuator module/pharmacologically selective effector molecule (PSAM/PSEM) allows remote manipulation of neuronal activity and behavior in living animals. Nevertheless, its application in nonhuman primates (NHPs) is still limited. Here, we used multitracer positron emission tomography (PET) imaging and pharmacological magnetic resonance imaging (phMRI) to visualize an excitatory chemogenetic ion channel (PSAM4-5HT3) and validate its chemometric function in macaque monkeys. Our results provide the optimal agonist, dose, and timing for chemogenetic neuronal manipulation, facilitating the use of the PSAM/PSEM system and expanding the flexibility and reliability of circuit manipulation in NHPs in a variety of situations.",

        "abstract": "DRAM1 is an infection inducible autophagy modulator, previously shown to promote autophagic and lysosomal defense responses against the intracellular pathogen <i>Mycobacterium marinum</i>. However, its possible role in other anti-bacterial autophagic mechanisms remains unknown. Recently, LC3-associated phagocytosis (LAP) has emerged as autophagy-related mechanism that targets bacteria directly in phagosomes. Our previous work established LAP as the main autophagic mechanism by which macrophages restrict growth of <i>Salmonella</i> Typhimurium in a systemically infected zebrafish host. We therefore employed this infection model to investigate the possible role of Dram1 in LAP. Morpholino knockdown or CRISPR/Cas9-mediated mutation of Dram1 led to reduced host survival and increased bacterial burden during <i>S</i>. Typhimurium infection. In contrast, overexpression of <i>dram1</i> by mRNA injection curtailed <i>Salmonella</i> replication and reduced mortality of the infected host. During the early response to infection, GFP-Lc3-<i>Salmonella</i> associations were reduced in <i>dram1</i> knockdown or mutant embryos, and increased by <i>dram1</i> overexpression. Since LAP is known to require the activity of the phagosomal NADPH oxidase, we used a <i>Salmonella</i> biosensor strain to detect bacterial exposure to reactive oxygen species (ROS) and found that the ROS response was largely abolished with deficiency of <i>dram1</i>, while it was increased with <i>dram1</i> overexpression. Corroborating these results in a mammalian model, the LC3 and ROS responses to <i>Salmonella</i> were similarly reduced or increased by knockdown or overexpression of <i>Dram1</i>, respectively, in murine RAW264.7 macrophages. Together, these results demonstrate the host protective role of Dram1/DRAM1 during <i>S</i>. Typhimurium infection and suggest a functional link between Dram1/DRAM1 and the induction of LAP. <b>Abbreviations:</b> ATG8: Autophagy related protein 8; ATG16: Autophagy related protein 16; CFU: colony-forming unit; DRAM1: DNA damage regulated autophagy modulator gene 1; dpf: days post fertilization; GFP: green fluorescent protein; hpi: hours post infection; LAP: LC3 associated phagocytosis; LC3, microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3; NADPH: Nicotinamide dinucleotide phosphate; p53: Tumor suppressor protein 53: ROS; reactive oxygen species; <i>S</i>.

        "abstract": "Inhibitory neurons embedded within mammalian neural circuits shape breathing, walking, chewing, and other rhythmic motor behaviors. At the core of the neural circuit controlling breathing is the preBötzinger Complex (preBötC), a nucleus in the ventrolateral medulla necessary for generation of inspiratory rhythm. In the preBötC, a recurrently connected network of glutamatergic Dbx1-derived (Dbx1 <sup>+</sup> ) neurons generates rhythmic inspiratory drive. Functionally and anatomically intercalated among Dbx1 <sup>+</sup> preBötC neurons are GABAergic (GAD1/2 <sup>+</sup> ) and glycinergic (GlyT2 <sup>+</sup> ) neurons, whose roles in breathing remain unclear. To elucidate the inhibitory microcircuits within preBötC, we first characterized the spatial distribution of molecularly-defined inhibitory preBötC subpopulations in double reporter mice expressing either the red fluorescent protein tdTomato or EGFP in GlyT2 <sup>+</sup> , GAD1 <sup>+</sup> , or GAD2 <sup>+</sup> neurons. We found that, in postnatal mice, the majority of inhibitory preBötC neurons expressed a combination of GlyT2 and GAD2 while a much smaller subpopulation also expressed GAD1. To determine the functional role of these subpopulations, we used holographic photostimulation, a patterned illumination technique with high spatiotemporal resolution, in rhythmically active medullary slices from neonatal Dbx1 <sup>tdTomato</sup> ;GlyT2 <sup>EGFP</sup> and Dbx1 <sup>tdTomato</sup> ;GAD1 <sup>EGFP</sup> double reporter mice. Stimulation of 4 or 8 preBötC GlyT2 <sup>+</sup> neurons during endogenous rhythm prolonged the interburst interval in a phase-dependent manner and increased the latency to burst initiation when bursts were evoked by stimulation of Dbx1 <sup>+</sup> neurons. In contrast, stimulation of 4 or 8 preBötC GAD1 <sup>+</sup> neurons did not affect interburst interval or latency to burst initiation. Instead, photoactivation of GAD1 <sup>+</sup> neurons during the inspiratory burst prolonged endogenous and evoked burst duration and decreased evoked burst amplitude. We conclude that the majority of preBötC inhibitory neurons express both GlyT2 and GAD2 and modulate breathing rhythm by delaying burst initiation while a smaller GAD1 <sup>+</sup> subpopulation shapes inspiratory patterning by altering burst duration and amplitude.",

At least 5 ng of Hg mass is required for Hg isotopic analysis. Given the low Hg concentration in natural waters, a large volume of water (>10 L) is typically needed. The conventional grab sampling method is time-consuming, laborious, and prone to contamination during transportation and preconcentration steps. In this study, a DGT (diffusive gradients in thin films) method based on aminopropyl and mercaptopropyl bi-functionalized SBA-15 nanoparticles was developed and extended to determine the concentration and isotopic composition of aqueous Hg for the first time. The results of laboratory analysis showed that Hg adsorption by DGT induces ∼ -0.2‰ mass-dependent fractionation (MDF) and little mass-independent fractionation (MIF). The magnitude of MDF exhibits a dependence on the diffusion-layer thickness of DGT. Since Hg-MDF can occur in a broad range of environmental processes, monitoring the δ<sup>202</sup>Hg of aqueous Hg using the DGT method should be performed with caution. Field results show consistent MIF signatures (Δ<sup>199</sup>Hg) between the DGT and conventional grab sampling method.

Our approach uses simultaneous multiplane imaging to monitor activity within contiguous tissue volumes with no penalty in speed or requirement for high excitation power.

These tools allow, for example, probing cell morphology and migration in response to changes in chemo-physical properties of their microenvironment. In order to understand how microtopographical features, what cells encounter in vivo, affect cytoskeletal organization and nuclear mechanics, we used direct laser writing via two-photon polymerization (TPP) to fabricate substrates which contain different surface microtopographies.

In concert, the nuclei of these cells were also more aligned, elongated, deformed and less flattened, indicating changes in nuclear force transduction.

Complex memory register circuits could enable multiplex interrogation of biomarkers and signals. A theory-based approach to create genetic circuits containing memory, known as sequential logic circuits, was previously established for a model laboratory strain of <i>Escherichia coli</i>, yet how circuit component performance varies for nonmodel and clinically relevant bacterial strains is poorly understood. Here, we develop a scalable computational approach to design robust sequential logic circuits in probiotic strain <i>Escherichia coli</i> Nissle 1917 (EcN). In this work, we used TetR-family transcriptional repressors to build genetic logic gates that can be composed into sequential logic circuits, along with a set of engineered sensors relevant for use in the gut environment. Using standard methods, 16 genetic NOT gates and nine sensors were experimentally characterized in EcN. These data were used to design and predict the performance of circuit designs. We present a set of genetic circuits encoding both combinational logic and sequential logic and show that the circuit outputs are in close agreement with our quantitative predictions from the design algorithm.

Two weeks following intracerebral delivery of either synthetic nanocapsules (NCs) containing CRISPR ribonucleoprotein targeting the tdTomato stop cassette or adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors expressing Cre recombinase, the brains were collected, and the presence of tdTomato was assessed in both the striatum and SN. <b>Results:</b> TdTomato expression was observed at the injection site in both the NC- and AAV-treated groups and typically colocalized with the neuronal marker NeuN. In the SN, tdTomato-positive fibers were present in the pars reticulata, and SNpr area expressing tdTomato correlated with the size of the striatal genome edited area. <b>Conclusion:</b> These results demonstrate <i>in vivo</i> anterograde axonal transport of reporter gene protein products to the SNpr following neuronal genome editing in the striatum.",

        "abstract": "Restoring function in chronic stages of spinal cord injury (SCI) has often been met with failure or reduced efficacy when regenerative strategies are delayed past the acute or sub-acute stages of injury. Restoring function in the chronically injured spinal cord remains a critical challenge. We found that a single injection of retrogradely transported adeno-associated viruses (AAVrg) to knockout the phosphatase and tensin homolog protein (PTEN) in chronic SCI can effectively target both damaged and spared axons and transiently restore locomotor functions in near-complete injury models. AAVrg's were injected to deliver cre recombinase and/or a red fluorescent protein (RFP) under the human Synapsin 1 promoter (hSyn1) into the spinal cords of C57BL/6 PTEN<sup>FloxΔ</sup>/<sup>Δ</sup> mice to knockout PTEN (PTEN-KO) in a severe thoracic SCI crush model at both acute and chronic time points. PTEN-KO improved locomotor abilities in both acute and chronic SCI conditions over a 9-week period. Regardless of whether treatment was initiated at the time of injury (acute), or three months after SCI (chronic), mice with limited hindlimb joint movement gained hindlimb weight support after treatment. Interestingly, functional improvements were not sustained beyond 9 weeks coincident with a loss of RFP reporter-gene expression and a near-complete loss of treatment-associated functional recovery by 6 months post-treatment. Treatment effects were also specific to severely injured mice; animals with weight support at the time of treatment lost function over a 6-month period. Retrograde tracing with Fluorogold revealed viable neurons throughout the motor cortex despite a loss of RFP expression at 9 weeks post-PTEN-KO. However, few Fluorogold labeled neurons were detected within the motor cortex at 6 months post-treatment. BDA labeling from the motor cortex revealed a dense corticospinal tract (CST) bundle in all groups except chronically treated PTEN-KO mice, indicating a potential long-term toxic effect of PTEN-KO to neurons in the motor cortex which was corroborated by a loss of β-tubulin III labeling above the lesion within spinal cords after PTEN-KO. PTEN-KO mice had significantly more β-tubulin III labeled axons within the lesion when treatment was delivered acutely, but not chronically post-SCI. In conclusion, we have found that using AAVrg's to knockout PTEN is an effective manipulation capable of restoring motor functions in chronic SCI and can enhance axon growth of currently unidentified axon populations when delivered acutely after injury. However, the long-term consequences of PTEN-KO on neuronal health and viability should be further explored.",

As such, gold nanorods (AuNRs) functionalized with ACE2 ectodomain (ACE2ED) act not only as decoys for these viruses to keep them from binding with the ACE2-expressing cells but also as agents to ablate infectious virions through heat generated from AuNRs under near-infrared (NIR) laser irradiation. Using plasmid containing the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein gene (with a D614G mutation), spike protein pseudotyped viral particles with a lentiviral core and green fluorescent protein reporter were constructed and used for transfecting ACE2-expressing HEK293T cells. Since these viral particles behave like their coronavirus counterparts, they are the ideal surrogates of native virions for studying viral entry into host cells. Our results showed that, once the surrogate pseudoviruses with spike protein encounter ACE2ED-tethered AuNRs, these virions are entrapped, resulting in decreased viral infection to ACE2-expressing HEK293T cells. Moreover, the effect of photothermolysis created by ACE2ED-tagged AuNRs under 808-nm NIR laser irradiation for 5 min led to viral breakdown. In summary, ACE2ED-tethered AuNRs with dual functions (virus decoy and destruction) could have an intriguing advantage in the treatment of diseases involving rapidly mutating viral species such as SARS-CoV-2.",

        "abstract": "Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the most common cancer types worldwide, and its prevention and treatment methods have garnered much attention. As the active ingredient of licorice, 18β-glycyrrhetinic acid (18β-GRA) has a variety of pharmacological effects. The aim of this study was to explore the effective target of 18β-GRA in the treatment of GC, in order to provide effective ideas for the clinical prevention and treatment of GC. To investigate the mechanism of 18β-GRA in inhibiting cell proliferation and promoting autophagy flux in GC cells. Whole transcriptomic analyses were used to analyze and screen differentially expressed microRNAs (miRNAs) in GC cells after 18β-GRA intervention. Lentivirus-transfected GC cells and the Cell Counting Kit-8 were used to detect cell proliferation ability, cell colony formation ability was detected by the clone formation assay, and flow cytometry was used to detect the cell cycle and apoptosis. A nude mouse transplantation tumor model of GC cells was constructed to verify the effect of miR-328-3p overexpression on the tumorigenicity of GC cells. Tumor tissue morphology was observed by hematoxylin and eosin staining, and microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3) expression was detected by immunohistochemistry. TransmiR, STRING, and miRWalk databases were used to predict the relationship between miR-328-3p and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3)-related information. Expression of <i>STAT3</i> mRNA and <i>miR-328-3p</i> was detected by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and the expression levels of STAT3, phosphorylated STAT3 (p-STAT3), and LC3 were detected by western blot analysis. The targeted relationship between <i>miR-328-3p</i> and <i>STAT3</i> was detected using the dual-luciferase reporter gene system. AGS cells were infected with monomeric red fluorescent protein-green fluorescent protein-LC3 adenovirus double label. LC3 was labeled and autophagy flow was observed under a confocal laser microscope. The expression of miR-328-3p was significantly upregulated after 18β-GRA intervention in AGS cells (<i>P</i> = 4.51E-06). Overexpression of miR-328-3p inhibited GC cell proliferation and colony formation ability, arrested the cell cycle in the G0/G1 phase, promoted cell apoptosis, and inhibited the growth of subcutaneous tumors in BALB/c nude mice (<i>P</i> < 0.01). No obvious necrosis was observed in the tumor tissue in the negative control group (no drug intervention or lentivirus transfection) and vector group (the blank vector for lentivirus transfection), and more cells were loose and necrotic in the miR-328-3p group. Bioinformatics tools predicted that miR-328-3p has a targeting relationship with STAT3, and STAT3 was closely related to autophagy markers such as p62. After overexpressing miR-328-3p, the expression level of <i>STAT3</i> mRNA was significantly decreased (<i>P</i> < 0.01) and p-STAT3 was downregulated (<i>P</i> < 0.05). The dual-luciferase reporter gene assay showed that the luciferase activity of <i>miR-328-3p</i> and <i>STAT3</i> 3' untranslated regions of the wild-type reporter vector group was significantly decreased (<i>P</i> < 0.001). Overexpressed miR-328-3p combined with bafilomycin A<sub>1</sub> (Baf A<sub>1</sub>) was used to detect the expression of LC3 II. Compared with the vector group, the expression level of LC3 II in the overexpressed miR-328-3p group was downregulated (<i>P</i> < 0.05), and compared with the Baf A<sub>1</sub> group, the expression level of LC3 II in the overexpressed miR-328-3p + Baf A<sub>1</sub> group was upregulated (<i>P</i> < 0.01). The expression of LC3 II was detected after intervention of 18β-GRA in GC cells, and the results were consistent with the results of miR-328-3p overexpression (<i>P</i> < 0.05). Additional studies showed that 18β-GRA promoted autophagy flow by promoting autophagosome synthesis (<i>P</i> < 0.001). qPCR showed that the expression of <i>STAT3</i> mRNA was downregulated after drug intervention (<i>P</i> < 0.05). Western blot analysis showed that the expression levels of STAT3 and p-STAT3 were significantly downregulated after drug intervention (<i>P</i> < 0.05). 18β-GRA promotes the synthesis of autophagosomes and inhibits GC cell proliferation by regulating the miR-328-3p/STAT3 signaling pathway.",

        "abstract": "The mechanisms underlying pulmonary hypertension (PH) remain largely unknown; further, why advanced vascular remodeling preferentially occurs in arterioles is yet to be answered. VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) regulates angiogenesis through Flk1 (fetal liver kinase 1) and Flt1 (fms-like tyrosine kinase 1) on endothelial cells (ECs), which may be related to PH pathogenesis. However, spatiotemporal expression patterns of Flk1 and Flt1 in the pulmonary vascular system and the role of endothelial Flk1 in PH development remain poorly understood. We analyzed multiple reporter mice, including Flk1-GFP (green fluorescent protein) bacterial artificial chromosome transgenic (Tg), Flt1-DsRed bacterial artificial chromosome Tg, and Flk1-GFP/Flt1-DsRed double Tg mice, to determine the spatiotemporal expression of Flk1 and Flt1 in hypoxia-induced PH. We also used Cdh5<sup>CreERT2</sup>/Flk1<sup>f/f</sup>/Tomato (Flk1-KO [knockout]) mice to induce EC-specific Flk1 deletion and lineage tracing in chronic hypoxia. Flk1 was specifically expressed in the ECs of small pulmonary vessels, including arterioles. Conversely, Flt1 was more broadly expressed in the ECs of large- to small-sized vessels in adult mouse lungs. Intriguingly, Flk1<sup>+</sup> ECs were transiently increased in hypoxia with proliferation, whereas Flt1 expression was unchanged. Flk1-KO mice did not exhibit pulmonary vascular remodeling nor PH in normoxia; however, the arteriolar ECs changed to a cuboidal shape with protrusion. In hypoxia, Flk1 deletion exacerbated EC dysfunction and reduced their number via apoptosis. Additionally, Flk1 deletion promoted medial thickening and neointimal formation in arterioles and worsened PH. Mechanistically, lineage tracing revealed that neointimal cells were derived from Flk1-KO ECs. Moreover, RNA sequencing in pulmonary ECs demonstrated that Flk1 deletion and hypoxia synergistically activated multiple pathways, including cell cycle, senescence/apoptosis, and cytokine/growth factor, concomitant with suppression of cell adhesion and angiogenesis, to promote vascular remodeling. Flk1 and Flt1 were differentially expressed in pulmonary ECs. Flk1 deficiency and hypoxia jointly dysregulated arteriolar ECs to promote vascular remodeling. Thus, dysfunction of Flk1<sup>+</sup> ECs may contribute to the pathogenesis of advanced vascular remodeling in pulmonary arterioles.",

HEK293T cells were transfected by the plasmid of the cloned gene for functional studies. The CDS of the mRNA translated into the protein sequence and three-dimensional structure of the channel has been calculated. An mRNA, 9378 bp, was firstly cloned from crayfish which codes a 2674 residues protein. The cloned sequence is similar to the piezo channel mRNAs reported in the other species. The sequence of the coded protein has been analyzed, and some functional domains have been identified. A three-dimensional structure of the coded protein was successfully calculated in reference to mouse piezo 1 channel protein data. A plasmid with a fluorescent protein indicator was synthesized for heterologous expression in HEK293T cells. The evoked calcium response to mechanical stimulation was not different from those observed in the control cells. However, the transfected cells were more sensitive to the gating modifier YODA-1.

Bioluminescence imaging is an advantageous method for in vivo studies that allows for the simple acquisition of images with low background signals. Researchers have increasingly been looking for ways to improve bioluminescent imaging for in vivo applications, which we sought to achieve by developing a bioluminescent probe that could specifically target cells of interest. We chose pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) as the disease model because it is the most common type of pancreatic cancer and has an extremely low survival rate. We targeted the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which is frequently overexpressed in pancreatic cancer cells, using an EGFR-specific affibody to selectively identify PDAC cells and delivered a <i>Gaussia</i> luciferase (GLuc) bioluminescent protein for imaging by engineering a fusion protein with both the affibody and the bioluminescent protein. This fusion protein was then complexed with a G5-PAMAM dendrimer nanocarrier. The dendrimer was used to improve the protein stability in vivo and increase signal strength. Our targeted bioluminescent complex had an enhanced uptake into PDAC cells in vitro and localized to PDAC tumors in vivo in pancreatic cancer xenograft mice. The bioluminescent complexes could delineate the tumor shape, identify multiple masses, and locate metastases. Through this work, an EGFR-targeted bioluminescent-dendrimer complex enabled the straightforward identification and imaging of pancreatic cancer cells in vivo in preclinical models. This argues for the targeted nanocarrier-mediated delivery of bioluminescent proteins as a way to improve in vivo bioluminescent imaging.",

        "abstract": "Male mammals display different paternal responses to pups, either attacking or killing the young offspring, or contrastingly, caring for them. The neural circuit mechanism underlying the between-individual variation in the pup-directed responsiveness of male mammals remains unclear. Monogamous mandarin voles were used to complete the present study. The male individuals were identified as paternal and infanticidal voles, according their behavioral responses to pups. It was found that the serotonin release in the medial preoptic area (MPOA), as well as the serotonergic neuron activity, significantly increased upon licking the pups, but showed no changes after attacking the pups, as revealed by the in vivo fiber photometry of the fluorescence signal from the 5-HT 1.0 sensor and the calcium imaging indicator, respectively. It was verified that the 5-HTergic neural projections to the MPOA originated mainly from the ventral part of the dorsal raphe (vDR). Furthermore, the chemogenetic inhibition of serotonergic projections from the vDR to the MPOA decreased the paternal behaviors and shortened the latency to attack the pups. In contrast, the activation of serotonergic neurons via optogenetics extended the licking duration and inhibited infanticide. Collectively, these results elucidate that the serotonergic projections from the vDR to the MPOA, a previously unrecognized pathway, regulate the paternal responses of virgin male mandarin voles to pups.",

The diversity of vector systems and cell carriers for the delivery of therapeutic genes revealed the difficulty of developing and implementing a safe and effective drug containing artificial genetic material for the treatment of human diseases in practical medicine. Therefore, in this study we assessed changes in the transcriptome and secretome of umbilical cord blood mononuclear cells (UCB-MCs) genetically modified using adenoviral vector (Ad5) carrying cDNA encoding human vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF165) or reporter green fluorescent protein (GFP). A preliminary analysis of UCB-MCs transduced with Ad5-VEGF165 and Ad5-GFP with MOI of 10 showed efficient transgene expression in gene-modified UCB-MCs at mRNA and protein levels. The whole transcriptome sequencing of native UCB-MCs, UCB-MC+Ad5-VEGF165, and UCB-MC+Ad5-GFP demonstrated individual sample variability rather than the effect of Ad5 or the expression of recombinant <i>vegf165</i> on UCB-MC transcriptomes. A multiplex secretome analysis indicated that neither the transduction of UCB-MCs with Ad5-GFP nor with Ad5-VEGF165 affects the secretion of the studied cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors by gene-modified cells.

The central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) is known not only for its role in the regulation of anxiety but also as an important site for the negative affective dimension of pain. Pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide (PACAP), a neuropeptide whose terminals are abundant in the CeA, is strongly implicated in the stress response as well as in pain processing. Here, using Cre-dependent viral vectors, we explored in greater detail the role of the PACAP projection to the CeA that originates in the lateral parabrachial nucleus (LPB). We first performed a circuit mapping experiment by injecting an anterograde Cre-dependent virus expressing a fluorescent reporter in the LPB of PACAP-Cre mice and observing their projections. Then, we used a chemogenetic approach (a Cre-dependent Designer Receptors Activated by Designer Drugs, DREADDs) to assess the effects of the direct stimulation of the PACAP LPB to CeA projection on general locomotor activity, anxiety-like behavior (using a defensive withdrawal test), and mechanical pain sensitivity (using the von Frey test). We found that the CeA, together with other areas, is one of the major downstream projection targets of PACAP neurons originating in the lateral parabrachial nucleus (LPB). In the DREADD experiment, we then found that the selective activation of this neuronal pathway is sufficient to increase both anxiety-like behavior and mechanical pain sensitivity in mice, without affecting general locomotor activity. In conclusion, our data suggest that the dysregulation of this circuit may contribute to a variety of anxiety disorders and chronic pain states, and that PACAP may represent an important therapeutic target for the treatment of these conditions.",

Unlike mammals, zebrafish can regenerate both damaged tissue and severed axons in the central nervous system. Here, we present a tractable adult zebrafish model to study intraocular axon regeneration after penetrating eye injury. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> To create consistent penetrating intraocular injuries, pins of standardized diameters were inserted into the eye through the cornea and penetrating the retina but not the underlying sclera. Transgenic g<i>ap43:GFP</i> reporter fish were used to preferentially label retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) that respond to injury with regenerating axons. Retinas were fixed and flat mounted at various times postinjury to examine injury size, number of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-positive cells and axons, axonal varicosities, and rate of regeneration to the optic nerve head. Intraocular injection of colchicine was used to inhibit axon outgrow as a proof of principle that this method can be used to screen effects of pharmacological agents on intraocular axon regeneration. <b><i>Results:</i></b> Penetrating injury to the zebrafish retina results in robust axon regeneration by RGCs around and beyond the site of injury. The <i>gap43:GFP</i> transgene allows visualization of individual or small bundles of axons with varicosities and growth cones easily observable. Regeneration proceeded with most, if not all, axons reaching the optic nerve head by 3-day postinjury. A single intraocular injection of colchicine a day after injury was sufficient to delay axon regeneration at 2-days postinjury. Surprisingly, we identified a stereotypically located population of circumferential projecting neurons within the retina that upregulate <i>gap43:GFP</i> expression after injury. <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> Penetrating injury to the adult <i>gap43:GFP</i> transgenic zebrafish eye is a model of successful intraocular axon regeneration. The pharmacological and genetic tools available for this organism should make it a powerful tool for dissecting the cellular, molecular, and genetic mechanisms of axon regeneration in the intraocular environment.",

Switching from serum-containing media to chemically-defined, serum free media, and minimising the number of process additions, are both increasingly regarded as necessary steps for simplifying and potentially automating lentiviral vector bioprocessing in future. Here we adapted human embryonic kidney 293T (HEK293T) cells to grow in serum-free media and also modified these cells with transgenes designed to encode a secreted nuclease activity. Stable transfection of HEK293T cells with transgenes encoding the <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> nuclease B (NucB) open reading frame with either its native secretion signal peptide, the murine Igκ chain leader sequence or a novel viral transport fusion protein, all resulted in qualitatively detectable nuclease activity in serum-free media. Serum-free transient transfection of human embryonic kidney HEK293T cells stably harbouring the transgene for NucB with its native secretion signal produced active lentivirus in the presence of medium-resident nuclease activity.

Sufficient nuclease activity was present in 10 μL of this unconcentrated lentivirus material to degrade 1.5 μg DNA within 2 h at 37 °C, without agitation - conditions compatible with lentivirus production.

An exogenous peptide, (DPc10) detects leaky RyR2 in cardiomyocytes. Conversely, calmodulin (CaM) inhibits RyR2 leak. These observations have led to designing a FRET biosensor for drug discovery targeting RyR2. Here we used FRET to understand the molecular mechanism driving the DPc10-CaM interdependence when binding RyR2 in SR vesicles. We used donor-FKBP12.6 (D-FKBP) to resolve RyR2 binding of acceptor-CaM (A-CaM). In low nanomolar Ca <sup>2+</sup> , DPc10 decreased both FRET <sub>max</sub> (under saturating [A-CaM]) and the CaM/RyR2 binding affinity. In micromolar Ca <sup>2+</sup> , DPc10 decreased FRET <sub>max</sub> without affecting CaM/RyR2 binding affinity. This correlates with analysis of fluorescence-lifetime-detected FRET indicating that DPc10 lowers occupancy of the RyR2 CaM-binding sites in nanomolar (not micromolar) Ca <sup>2+</sup> and lengthens D-FKBP/A-CaM distances independent of [Ca <sup>2+</sup> ]. To observe DPc10/RyR2 binding, we used acceptor-DPc10 (A-DPc10). CaM weakens A-DPc10/RyR2 binding, this effect being larger in micromolar vs. nanomolar Ca <sup>2+</sup> . Moreover, A-DPc10/RyR2 binding is cooperative in CaM- and FKBP-dependent manner, suggesting that both endogenous modulators promote concerted structural changes between RyR2 protomers for channel regulation. Aided by analysis of cryo-EM structures, these insights inform further development of the DPc10-CaM paradigm for therapeutic discovery targeting RyR2.",

        "abstract": "The Arxula yeast bisphenol screen (A-YBS) utilizes the bioluminescent Arxula adeninivorans yeast-based reporter cells for tailored analysis of bisphenols, one of the major endocrine-disrupting compound groups. For the first time, this bioreporter has been applied on the high-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC) adsorbent surface to develop a respective planar bioluminescence bioassay (pA-YBS). The goal was to combine the advantages of HPTLC with a more selective bioassay detection for bisphenols. The performance of this pA-YBS bioluminescence bioassay was demonstrated by calculating the half-maximal effective concentration (EC<sub>50</sub>) of bisphenols compared to references. The EC<sub>50</sub> ranged from 267 pg/band for bisphenol Z and 322 pg/band for bisphenol A (BPA) to > 1 ng/band for other bisphenols (BPC, BPE, BPF, and BPS) and references (17β-estradiol and 17α-ethinylestradiol). The EC<sub>50</sub> value of BPA was three times more sensitive in signal detection than that of 17β-estradiol. The visual or videodensitometric limit of detection of BPA was about 200 pg/zone. The higher signal intensity and sensitivity for BPA confirmed the tailored bioassay selectivity compared to the existing estrogen screen bioassay. It worked on different types of HPTLC silica gel plates. This HPTLC-UV/Vis/FLD-pA-YBS bioluminescence bioassay method was used to analyze complex mixtures such as six tin can migrates, five thermal papers, and eleven botanicals. The detected estrogenic compound zones in the tin can migrates were successfully verified via the duplex planar yeast antagonist estrogen screen (pYAES) bioassay. The two bisphenols A and S were identified in one out of five thermal papers and confirmed with high-resolution mass spectrometry.

Most genetically encoded optical sensors currently used are based on fluorescence and have been highly successful tools for single-cell imaging in superficial brain regions. However, there remains a need to develop new tools for reporting neuronal activity <i>in vivo</i> within deeper structures without the need for hardware such as lenses or fibers to be implanted within the brain. Our approach to this problem is to replace the fluorescent elements of the existing biosensors with bioluminescent elements. This eliminates the need of external light sources to illuminate the sensor, thus allowing deeper brain regions to be imaged noninvasively. Here, we report the development of the first genetically encoded neurotransmitter indicators based on bioluminescent light emission. These probes were optimized by high-throughput screening of linker libraries. The selected probes exhibit robust changes in light output in response to the extracellular presence of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate. We expect this new approach to neurotransmitter indicator design to enable the engineering of specific bioluminescent probes for multiple additional neurotransmitters in the future, ultimately allowing neuroscientists to monitor activity associated with a specific neurotransmitter as it relates to behavior in a variety of neuronal and psychiatric disorders, among many other applications.",

Gene therapy guided through the use of biomaterials may steadily activate the processes of repair in sites of ACL injury. The goal of the present study was to test the hypothesis that functionalized poly(sodium styrene sulfonate)-grafted poly(ε-caprolactone) (pNaSS-grafted PCL) films can effectively deliver recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) vectors as a means of overexpressing two reparative factors (transforming growth factor beta-TGF-β and basic fibroblast growth factor-FGF-2) in primary human ACL fibroblasts. Effective, durable rAAV reporter red fluorescent protein and candidate TGF-β and FGF-2 gene overexpression was achieved in the cells for at least 21 days, especially when pNaSS-grafted PCL films were used versus control conditions, such as ungrafted films and systems lacking vectors or films (between 1.8- and 5.2-fold differences), showing interactive regulation of growth factor production. The expression of TGF-β and FGF-2 from rAAV via PCL films safely enhanced extracellular matrix depositions of type-I/-III collagen, proteoglycans/decorin, and tenascin-C (between 1.4- and 4.5-fold differences) in the cells over time with increased levels of expression of the specific transcription factors Mohawk and scleraxis (between 1.7- and 3.7-fold differences) and without the activation of the inflammatory mediators IL-1β and TNF-α, most particularly with pNaSS-grafted PCL films relative to the controls.

Using real-time in-vitro dual-color microscopy, Bioluminescence (BL) and fluorescence (FL) were detectable using distinct imaging setups. Detection of the bioluminescent signals were observed at single cell resolution on-chip 20 min post-addition of Furimazine substrate and under perfusion. All hydrogels enabled BLI with higher signal-to-noise ratios as compared to fluorescence. For instance, agarose gels showed a ∼5-fold greater BL signal over background after injection of the substrate as compared to the FL signal. The use of BLI with microfluidic chip technologies opens up the potential for simultaneous in situ detection with continuous monitoring of multicolor cell reporters.

        "abstract": "Cell polarity is a macroscopic phenomenon established by a collection of spatially concentrated molecules and structures that culminate in the emergence of specialized domains at the subcellular level. It is associated with developing asymmetric morphological structures that underlie key biological functions such as cell division, growth, and migration. In addition, the disruption of cell polarity has been linked to tissue-related disorders such as cancer and gastric dysplasia. Current methods to evaluate the spatiotemporal dynamics of fluorescent reporters in individual polarized cells often involve manual steps to trace a midline along the cells' major axis, which is time consuming and prone to strong biases. Furthermore, although ratiometric analysis can correct the uneven distribution of reporter molecules using two fluorescence channels, background subtraction techniques are frequently arbitrary and lack statistical support. This manuscript introduces a novel computational pipeline to automate and quantify the spatiotemporal behavior of single cells using a model of cell polarity: pollen tube/root hair growth and cytosolic ion dynamics. A three-step algorithm was developed to process ratiometric images and extract a quantitative representation of intracellular dynamics and growth. The first step segments the cell from the background, producing a binary mask through a thresholding technique in the pixel intensity space. The second step traces a path through the midline of the cell through a skeletonization operation. Finally, the third step provides the processed data as a ratiometric timelapse and yields a ratiometric kymograph (i.e., a 1D spatial profile through time). Data from ratiometric images acquired with genetically encoded fluorescent reporters from growing pollen tubes were used to benchmark the method. This pipeline allows for faster, less biased, and more accurate representation of the spatiotemporal dynamics along the midline of polarized cells, thus advancing the quantitative toolkit available to investigate cell polarity.

However, subsequent functional analyses of these assemblies have been hindered owing to the lack of genetic tools compatible with this thermophile, which are typically suited to other mesophilic eukaryotic model organisms, in particular the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Hence, we aimed to find genes from C. thermophilum that are expressed under the control of different sugars and examine their associated 5' untranslated regions as promoters responsible for sugar-regulated gene expression. To identify sugar-regulated promoters in C. thermophilum, we performed comparative xylose- versus glucose-dependent gene expression studies, which uncovered a number of enzymes with induced expression in the presence of xylose but repressed expression in glucose-supplemented media. Subsequently, we cloned the promoters of the two most stringently regulated genes, the xylosidase-like gene (XYL) and xylitol dehydrogenase (XDH), obtained from this genome-wide analysis in front of a thermostable yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) reporter. With this, we demonstrated xylose-dependent YFP expression by both Western blotting and live-cell imaging fluorescence microscopy. Prompted by these results, we expressed the C. thermophilum orthologue of a well-characterized dominant-negative ribosome assembly factor mutant, under the control of the XDH promoter, which allowed us to induce a nuclear export defect on the pre-60S subunit when C. thermophilum cells were grown in xylose- but not glucose-containing medium.

To clarify sites of Fgf23 promoter activity in Tmprss6-/- mice, we introduced a heterozygous enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) reporter allele at the endogenous Fgf23 locus. Heterozygous Fgf23 disruption did not alter the severity of systemic iron deficiency or anemia in the Tmprss6-/- mice. Tmprss6-/-Fgf23+/eGFP mice showed green fluorescence in the vascular regions of BM sections and showed a subset of BM endothelial cells that were GFPbright by flow cytometry. Mining of transcriptomic data sets from mice with normal iron balance revealed higher Fgf23 mRNA in BM sinusoidal endothelial cells (BM-SECs) than that in other BM endothelial cell populations. Anti-GFP immunohistochemistry of fixed BM sections from Tmprss6-/-Fgf23+/eGFP mice revealed GFP expression in BM-SECs, which was more intense than in nonanemic controls. In addition, in mice with intact Tmprss6 alleles, Fgf23-eGFP reporter expression increased in BM-SECs following large-volume phlebotomy and also following erythropoietin treatment both ex vivo and in vivo. Collectively, our results identified BM-SECs as a novel site for Fgf23 upregulation in both acute and chronic anemia.

Their rapid spiking enables them to control circuit dynamics on a millisecond time scale, and the timing of their activation by different excitatory pathways is critical to these functions. We used a genetically encoded hybrid voltage sensor to image PV interneuron voltage changes with sub-millisecond precision in primary somatosensory barrel cortex (BC) of adult mice. Electrical stimulation evoked depolarizations with a latency that increased with distance from the stimulating electrode, allowing us to determine conduction velocity. Spread of responses between cortical layers yielded an interlaminar conduction velocity and spread within layers yielded intralaminar conduction velocities in different layers. Velocities ranged from 74 to 473 μm/ms depending on trajectory; interlaminar conduction was 71% faster than intralaminar conduction. Thus, computations within columns are more rapid than between columns. The BC integrates thalamic and intracortical input for functions such as texture discrimination and sensory tuning. Timing differences between intra- and interlaminar PV interneuron activation could impact these functions. Imaging of voltage in PV interneurons reveals differences in signaling dynamics within cortical circuitry.

Here, we highlight the state-of-the-art in MRI-based biomolecular sensors, focusing on their physical mechanisms, quantitative characteristics, and biological applications.

Therefore, microbial single-cell analysis based on time-lapse microscopy is typically used to resolve microbial behavior at the single-cell level with spatiotemporal resolution. Time-lapse imaging then provides large image-data stacks that can be efficiently analyzed by deep learning analysis techniques, providing new insights into microbiology. This knowledge gain justifies the additional and often laborious microfluidic experiments. Obviously, the integration of on-chip O<sub>2</sub> measurement and control during the already complex microfluidic cultivation, and the development of image analysis tools, can be a challenging endeavor. A comprehensive experimental approach to allow spatiotemporal single-cell analysis of living microorganisms under controlled O<sub>2</sub> availability is presented here. To this end, a gas-permeable polydimethylsiloxane microfluidic cultivation chip and a low-cost 3D-printed mini-incubator were successfully used to control O<sub>2</sub> availability inside microfluidic growth chambers during time-lapse microscopy. Dissolved O<sub>2</sub> was monitored by imaging the fluorescence lifetime of the O<sub>2</sub>-sensitive dye RTDP using FLIM microscopy. The acquired image-data stacks from biological experiments containing phase contrast and fluorescence intensity data were analyzed using in-house developed and open-source image-analysis tools. The resulting oxygen concentration could be dynamically controlled between 0% and 100%.

Laboratory test showed a linear mass accumulation of Tl(I) and Tl(III) on the TP binding gels with the deployment time from 4 to 72 h.

        "abstract": "Mitochondria are susceptible to damage resulting from their activity as energy providers. Damaged mitochondria can cause harm to the cell and thus mitochondria are subjected to elaborate quality-control mechanisms including elimination via lysosomal degradation in a process termed mitophagy. Basal mitophagy is a house-keeping mechanism fine-tuning the number of mitochondria according to the metabolic state of the cell. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying basal mitophagy remain largely elusive. In this study, we visualized and assessed the level of mitophagy in H9c2 cardiomyoblasts at basal conditions and after OXPHOS induction by galactose adaptation. We used cells with a stable expression of a pH-sensitive fluorescent mitochondrial reporter and applied state-of-the-art imaging techniques and image analysis. Our data showed a significant increase in acidic mitochondria after galactose adaptation. Using a machine-learning approach we also demonstrated increased mitochondrial fragmentation by OXPHOS induction. Furthermore, super-resolution microscopy of live cells enabled capturing of mitochondrial fragments within lysosomes as well as dynamic transfer of mitochondrial contents to lysosomes. Applying correlative light and electron microscopy we revealed the ultrastructure of the acidic mitochondria confirming their proximity to the mitochondrial network, ER and lysosomes. Finally, exploiting siRNA knockdown strategy combined with flux perturbation with lysosomal inhibitors, we demonstrated the importance of both canonical as well as non-canonical autophagy mediators in lysosomal degradation of mitochondria after OXPHOS induction. Taken together, our high-resolution imaging approaches applied on H9c2 cells provide novel insights on mitophagy during physiologically relevant conditions. The implication of redundant underlying mechanisms highlights the fundamental importance of mitophagy.<b>Abbreviations:</b> ATG: autophagy related; ATG7: autophagy related 7; ATP: adenosine triphosphate; BafA1: bafilomycin A<sub>1</sub>; CLEM: correlative light and electron microscopy; EGFP: enhanced green fluorescent protein; MAP1LC3B: microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3 beta; OXPHOS: oxidative phosphorylation; PepA: pepstatin A; PLA: proximity ligation assay; PRKN: parkin RBR E3 ubiquitin protein ligase; RAB5A: RAB5A, member RAS oncogene family; RAB7A: RAB7A, member RAS oncogene family; RAB9A: RAB9A, member RAS oncogene family; ROS: reactive oxygen species; SIM: structured illumination microscopy; siRNA: short interfering RNA; SYNJ2BP: synaptojanin 2 binding protein; TEM: transmission electron microscopy; TOMM20: translocase of outer mitochondrial membrane 20; ULK1: unc-51 like kinase 1.",

Understanding the contribution of these lineages to mature organisms is a central question of developmental biology. Several techniques to document cell lineages have been used, from marking single cells with mutations that express a visible marker to generating molecular bar codes by CRISPR-induced mutations and subsequent single-cell analysis. Here, we exploit the mutagenic activity of CRISPR to allow lineage tracing within living plants with a single reporter. Cas9-induced mutations are directed to correct a frameshift mutation that restores expression of a nuclear fluorescent protein, labelling the initial cell and all progenitor cells with a strong signal without modifying other phenotypes of the plants. Spatial and temporal control of Cas9 activity can be achieved using tissue-specific and/or inducible promoters. We provide proof of principle for the function of lineage tracing in two model plants. The conserved features of the components and the versatile cloning system, allowing for easy exchange of promoters, are expected to make the system widely applicable.",

Here we investigate responses of PV interneurons in different layers of primary somatosensory barrel cortex (BC) to different excitatory inputs. With the genetically-encoded hybrid voltage sensor, hVOS, we recorded voltage changes simultaneously in many L2/3 and L4 PV interneurons to stimulation in either L2/3 or L4. Decay-times were consistent across L2/3 and L4. Amplitude, half-width, and rise-time were greater for PV interneurons residing in L2/3 compared to L4. Stimulation in L2/3 elicited responses in both L2/3 and L4 with longer latency compared to stimulation in L4. These differences in latency between layers could influence their windows for temporal integration. Thus PV interneurons in different cortical layers of BC show differences in response properties with potential roles in cortical computations.",

To detect and trace Vgll4-expressing cells and their progeny, we generated and characterized a new tamoxifen-inducible Dre knock-in mouse line, Vgll4-DreER. This mouse line expressed DreER (Dre recombinase fused to the estrogen receptor) under the control of the endogenous Vgll4 promoter. After crossing the Vgll4-DreER mouse line with the Dre-responsive reporter H11-rRFP, Dre-mediated recombination in the tissue was monitored on the basis of red fluorescent protein (RFP) signals, which indicated the distribution of VGLL4-positive cells in vivo. Our data revealed that VGLL4 is widely expressed in various cell types at embryonic and neonatal stages. After comparison with our previously reported Vgll4-GFP mouse, we found that the RFP signal profile was wider than the green fluorescent protein (GFP) pattern, indicating that Vgll4-DreER is more sensitive for labeling VGLL4-expressing cells. We next used a dual-recombination system to simultaneously label VGLL4- and keratin 5 (KRT5)-positive cell populations, and no crosstalk was observed in the Krt5-CreER;Vgll4-DreER;R26-rGlR mice.

The miR164 family is highly conserved in plants and the miR164-NAM/ATAF/CUC (NAC) module is validated to regulate leaf and flower development, lateral root initiation and stress response. However, our knowledge of its role in Populus remains limited. In this study, two mature miRNA species, miR164e-5p and miR164e-3p, were identified in Populus deltoides. Their nucleotide sequences were identical to those of miR164a/b/c/d/e-5p and miR164b/e-3p in P. tremula × P. alba clone 717-1B4 (hereinafter poplar 717), respectively. Transgenic plants of poplar 717, including overexpression lines (35S::pri-miR164e) and Short Tandem Target Mimic lines (STTM-miR164a-d,e-5p and STTM-miR164b/e-3p), were generated to study the roles of miR164e-5p and miR164e-3p in poplar.

Green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter assay showed that PtaCUC2a/2b and PtaORE1 were cleaved by miR164a-d,e-5p, and the cleavage was inhibited by STTM-miR164b/e-3p.

However, the non-canonical codon usage of <i>S. stipitis</i> is an obstacle for implementing molecular tools that were developed for other yeast species, thereby limiting the molecular toolset available for <i>S. stipitis</i>. Here, we developed a series of molecular tools for <i>S. stipitis</i> including BLINCAR, a Bio-Luminescent Indicator that is Nullified by Cas9-Actuated Recombination, which can be used repeatedly to add different exogenous DNA payloads to the wild-type <i>S. stipitis</i> genome or used repeatedly to remove multiple native <i>S. stipitis</i> genes from the wild-type genome. Through the use of BLINCAR tools, one first produces antibiotic-resistant, bioluminescent colonies of <i>S. stipitis</i> whose bioluminescence highlights those clones that have been genetically modified; then second, once candidate clones have been confirmed, one uses a transient Cas9-producing plasmid to nullify the antibiotic resistance and bioluminescent markers from the prior introduction, thereby producing non-bioluminescent colonies that highlight those clones which have been re-sensitized to the antibiotic and are therefore susceptible to another round of BLINCAR implementation. IMPORTANCE Cellulose and hemicellulose that comprise a large portion of sawdust, leaves, and grass can be valuable sources of fermentable sugars for ethanol production. However, some of the sugars liberated from hemicellulose (like xylose) are not easily fermented using conventional glucose-fermenting yeast like <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, so engineering robust xylose-fermenting yeast that is not inhibited by other components liberated from cellulose/hemicellulose will be important for maximizing yield and making lignocellulosic ethanol fermentation cost efficient. The yeast <i>Scheffersomyces stipitis</i> is one such yeast that can ferment xylose; however, it possesses several barriers to genetic manipulation. It is difficult to transform, has only a few antibiotic resistance markers, and uses an alternative genetic code from most other organisms. We developed a genetic toolset for <i>S. stipitis</i> that lowers these barriers and allows a user to deliver and/or delete multiple genetic elements to/from the wild-type genome, thereby expanding <i>S. stipitis's</i> potential.",

We adopted a standardized method for comparing gene promoter strength across species and laboratories.

The quantitative description of promoter strength is a valuable expansion of <i>P. taiwanensis</i> VLB120's genetic toolbox, while the comparison with the performance in <i>E. coli</i> facilitates the evaluation of <i>P. taiwanensis</i> VLB120's potential as a chassis for biotechnology applications.",

Experiments were conducted with adult male Sprague-Dawley rats. Bile duct ligation was used as a model of chronic liver cirrhosis. An adeno-associated virus containing a construct with an AVP promoter and either green fluorescent protein (GFP) or a ratiometric chloride indicator, ClopHensorN, was bilaterally injected into the SON of rats. After 2 weeks, rats received either BDL or sham surgery, and liver cirrhosis was allowed to develop for 4 weeks. In vitro, loose patch recordings of action potentials were obtained from GFP-labeled and unlabeled SON neurons in response to a brief focal application of the GABA<sub>A</sub> agonist muscimol (100 μM). Changes to intracellular chloride ([Cl]i) following muscimol application were determined by changes to the fluorescence ratio of ClopHensorN. The contribution of cation chloride cotransporters NKCC1 and KCC2 to changes in intracellular chloride was investigated using their respective antagonists, bumetanide (BU, 10 μM) and VU0240551 (10 μM). Plasma osmolality and hematocrit were measured as a marker of dilutional hyponatremia. The results showed reduced or absent GABA<sub>A</sub> -mediated inhibition in a greater proportion of AVP neurons from BDL rats as compared to sham rats (100% inhibition in sham vs. 47% in BDL, p = .001). Muscimol application was associated with increased [Cl]i in most cells from BDL as compared to cells from sham rats (χ<sup>2</sup>  = 30.24, p < .001).

However, challenges have included the development of safe and effective vector systems for gene editing of airway epithelia and model systems to report their efficiency and durability. The domestic ferret (<i>Mustela putorius furo</i>) has a high degree of conservation in lung cellular anatomy with humans, and has served as an excellent model for many types of lung diseases, including CF. In this study, we evaluated the efficiency of amphiphilic shuttle peptide S10 for protein delivery and gene editing using SpCas9, and AsCas12a (Cpf1) ribonucleoproteins (RNPs). These approaches were evaluated in proliferating ferret airway basal cells, polarized airway epithelia <i>in vitro</i>, and lungs <i>in vivo</i>, by accessing the editing efficiency using reporter ferrets and measuring indels at the ferret <i>CFTR</i> locus. Our results demonstrate that shuttle peptides efficiently enable delivery of reporter proteins/peptides and gene editing SpCas9 or Cpf1 RNP complexes to ferret airway epithelial cells <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. We measured S10 delivery efficiency of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-nuclear localization signal (NLS) protein or SpCas9 RNP into ferret airway basal cells and fully differentiated ciliated and nonciliated epithelial cells <i>in vitro</i>. <i>In vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> gene editing efficiencies were determined by Cas/LoxP-gRNA RNP-mediated conversion of a <i>ROSA</i>-TG Cre recombinase reporter using transgenic primary cells and ferrets. S10/Cas9 RNP was more effective, relative to S10/Cpf1 RNP at gene editing of the <i>ROSA</i>-TG locus. Intratracheal lung delivery of the S10 shuttle combined with GFP-NLS protein or D-Retro-Inverso (DRI)-NLS peptide demonstrated efficiencies of protein delivery that were ∼3-fold or 14-fold greater, respectively, than the efficiency of gene editing at the <i>ROSA</i>-TG locus using S10/Cas9/LoxP-gRNA. Cpf1 RNPs was less effective than SpCas9 at gene editing of LoxP locus.

We have generated a knock-in mouse model constitutively expressing Cre recombinase under the <i>Nmu</i> promoter. We have validated the model using a multi-level approach based on quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reactions, <i>in situ</i> hybridization, a reporter mouse line and an adenoviral vector driving Cre-dependent expression of a fluorescent protein. Using the Nmu-Cre mouse, we performed a complete characterization of NMU expression in adult mouse brain, unveiling a potential midline NMU modulatory circuit with the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (VMH) as a key node. Moreover, immunohistochemical analysis suggested that NMU neurons in the VMH mainly constitute a unique population of hypothalamic cells. Taken together, our results suggest that Cre expression in the Nmu-Cre mouse model largely reflects NMU expression in the adult mouse brain, without altering endogenous NMU expression.

A multi-spectral super-low-dose photoacoustic microscopy (SLD-PAM) is presented that improves the sensitivity by ≈33 times. SLD-PAM can visualize microvessels and quantify oxygen saturation in vivo with ≈1% of the maximum permissible exposure, dramatically reducing potential phototoxicity or perturbation to normal tissue function, especially in imaging of delicate tissues, such as the eye and the brain. Capitalizing on the high sensitivity, direct imaging of deoxyhemoglobin concentration is achieved without spectral unmixing, avoiding wavelength-dependent errors and computational noises. With reduced laser power, SLD-PAM can reduce photobleaching by ≈85%. It is also demonstrated that SLD-PAM achieves similar molecular imaging quality using 80% fewer contrast agents. Therefore, SLD-PAM enables the use of a broader range of low-absorbing nano-agents, small molecules, and genetically encoded biomarkers, as well as more types of low-power light sources in wide spectra.

GPCRs respond to a plethora of extracellular ligands and initiate signaling pathways inside cells via heterotrimeric G proteins (Gαβγ). Because of the critical role GPCRs play in regulating biological processes and as pharmacological targets, the availability of tools to measure their signaling activity are of high interest. Live-cell biosensors that detect the activity of G proteins in response to GPCR stimulation have emerged as a powerful approach to investigate GPCR/G protein signaling. Here, we detail methods to monitor G protein activity through direct measurement of GTP-bound Gα subunits using optical biosensors based on bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET). More specifically, this article describes the use of two types of complementary biosensors. The first protocol explains how to use a multicomponent BRET biosensor that relies on expression of exogenous G proteins in cell lines. This protocol yields robust responses that are compatible with endpoint measurements of dose-dependent ligand effects or with kinetic measurements of subsecond resolution. The second protocol describes the implementation of unimolecular biosensors that detect the activation of endogenous G proteins in cell lines expressing exogenous GPCRs or in primary cells upon stimulation of endogenous GPCRs.

        "abstract": "Danon disease is characterized by the failure of lysosomal biogenesis, maturation, and function due to a deficiency of lysosomal membrane structural protein (LAMP2). The current report describes a female patient with a sudden syncope and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy phenotype. We identified the pathogenic mutations in patients by whole-exon sequencing, followed by a series of molecular biology and genetic approaches to identify and functional analysis of the mutations. Suggestive findings by cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR), electrocardiogram (ECG), and laboratory examination suggested Danon disease which was confirmed by genetic testing. The patient carried a novel de novo mutation, LAMP2 c.2T>C located at the initiation codon. The quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and Western blot (WB) analysis of peripheral blood leukocytes from the patients revealed evidence of LAMP2 haploinsufficiency. Labeling of the new initiation codon predicted by the software with green fluorescent protein followed by fluorescence microscopy and Western blotting showed that the first ATG downstream from the original initiation codon became the new translational initiation codon. The three-dimensional structure of the mutated protein predicted by alphafold2 revealed that it consisted of only six amino acids and failed to form a functional polypeptide or protein. Overexpression of the mutated LAMP2 c.2T>C showed a loss of function of the protein, as assessed by the dual-fluorescence autophagy indicator system. The mutation was confirmed to be null, AR experiments and sequencing results confirmed that 28% of the mutant X chromosome remained active. We propose possible mechanisms of mutations associated with haploinsufficiency of LAMP2: (1) The inactivation X chromosome carrying the mutation was not significantly skewed. However, it decreased in the mRNA level and the expression ratio of the mutant transcripts; (2) The identified mutation is null, and the active mutant transcript fails to translate into the normal LAMP2 proteins. The presence of haploinsufficiency in LAMP2 and the X chromosome inactivation pattern were crucial factors contributing to the early onset of Danon disease in this female patient.",

        "abstract": "NMDA receptors (NMDARs) are ionotropic glutamate receptors that play a key role in excitatory neurotransmission. The number and subtype of surface NMDARs are regulated at several levels, including their externalization, internalization, and lateral diffusion between the synaptic and extrasynaptic regions. Here, we used novel anti-GFP (green fluorescent protein) nanobodies conjugated to either the smallest commercially available quantum dot 525 (QD525) or the several nanometer larger (and thus brighter) QD605 (referred to as nanoGFP-QD525 and nanoGFP-QD605, respectively). Targeting the yellow fluorescent protein-tagged GluN1 subunit in rat hippocampal neurons, we compared these two probes to a previously established larger probe, a rabbit anti-GFP IgG together with a secondary IgG conjugated to QD605 (referred to as antiGFP-QD605). The nanoGFP-based probes allowed faster lateral diffusion of the NMDARs, with several-fold increased median values of the diffusion coefficient (<i>D</i>). Using thresholded tdTomato-Homer1c signals to mark synaptic regions, we found that the nanoprobe-based <i>D</i> values sharply increased at distances over 100 nm from the synaptic edge, while <i>D</i> values for antiGFP-QD605 probe remained unchanged up to a 400 nm distance. Using the nanoGFP-QD605 probe in hippocampal neurons expressing the GFP-GluN2A, GFP-GluN2B, or GFP-GluN3A subunits, we detected subunit-dependent differences in the synaptic localization of NMDARs, <i>D</i> value, synaptic residence time, and synaptic-extrasynaptic exchange rate. Finally, we confirmed the applicability of the nanoGFP-QD605 probe to study differences in the distribution of synaptic NMDARs by comparing to data obtained with nanoGFPs conjugated to organic fluorophores, using universal point accumulation imaging in nanoscale topography and direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy.<b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Our study systematically compared the localization and mobility of surface NMDARs containing GFP-GluN2A, GFP-GluN2B, or GFP-GluN3A subunits expressed in rodent hippocampal neurons, using anti-green fluorescent protein (GFP) nanobodies conjugated to the quantum dot 605 (nanoGFP-QD605), as well as nanoGFP probes conjugated with small organic fluorophores. Our comprehensive analysis showed that the method used to delineate the synaptic region plays an important role in the study of synaptic and extrasynaptic pools of NMDARs. In addition, we showed that the nanoGFP-QD605 probe has optimal parameters for studying the mobility of NMDARs because of its high localization accuracy comparable to direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy and longer scan time compared with universal point accumulation imaging in nanoscale topography. The developed approaches are readily applicable to the study of any GFP-labeled membrane receptors expressed in mammalian neurons.",

        "abstract": "Single-molecule force spectroscopy (SMFS) is powerful for studying folding states and mechanical properties of proteins, however, it requires protein immobilization onto force-transducing probes such as cantilevers or microbeads. A common immobilization method relies on coupling lysine residues to carboxylated surfaces using 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethyl-aminopropyl) carbodiimide and N-hydroxysuccinimide (EDC/NHS). Because proteins typically contain many lysine groups, this strategy results in a heterogeneous distribution of tether positions. Genetically encoded peptide tags (e.g., ybbR) provide alternative chemistries for achieving site-specific immobilization, but thus far a direct comparison of site-specific vs. lysine-based immobilization strategies to assess effects on the observed mechanical properties was lacking. Here, we compared lysine- vs. ybbR-based protein immobilization in SMFS assays using several model polyprotein systems. Our results show that lysine-based immobilization results in significant signal deterioration for monomeric streptavidin-biotin interactions, and loss of the ability to correctly classify unfolding pathways in a multipathway Cohesin-Dockerin system. We developed a mixed immobilization approach where a site-specifically tethered ligand was used to probe surface-bound proteins immobilized through lysine groups, and found partial recovery of specific signals. The mixed immobilization approach represents a viable alternative for mechanical assays on in vivo-derived samples or other proteins of interest where genetically encoded tags are not feasible.",

Adeno-associated virus (AAV) has been widely used for <i>in vivo</i> gene therapy, but its limited 4.7 kb packing capacity presents challenges in delivering CBE by a single AAV. To address this, one feasible solution is to split CBE into two sections for dual-AAV delivery. In this study, we utilized BE3 as an example and constructed 22 potential split-BE3 pairs with the combination of 11 splitting sites and two split-inteins (Npu and Rma). These split-BE3 pairs were initially screened in the green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter system, with six split-BE3 pairs selected for further evaluation. The subsequent screening of split-BE3 pairs was performed at two endogenous sites in 293T and HeLa cells, revealing that the split-BE3-Rma674, split-BE3-Rma713, and split-BE3-Rma1005 displayed effective C-to-T conversion after transfection. The effectiveness of dual-AAV split-BE3 was further validated in culture cells and adult mouse eyes. Of note, the split-BE3-Rma674 demonstrated the most efficient C-to-T editing after AAV infection, with a maximal editing efficiency of 23.29% ± 10.98% in the mouse retinal pigment epithelium cells <i>in vivo</i>.

        "abstract": "Bacillus subtilis has been widely used and generally recognized as a safe host for the production of recombinant proteins, high-value chemicals, and pharmaceuticals. Thus, its metabolic engineering attracts significant attention. Nevertheless, the limited availability of selective markers makes this process difficult and time-consuming, especially in the case of multistep biosynthetic pathways. Here, we employ CRISPR/Cas9 technology to build an easy cloning toolkit that addresses commonly encountered obstacles in the metabolic engineering of B. subtilis, including the chromosomal integration locus, promoter, terminator, and guide RNA (gRNA) target. Six promoters were characterized, and the promoter strengths ranged from 0.9- to 23-fold that of the commonly used strong promoter P<i><sub>43</sub></i>. We characterized seven terminators in B. subtilis, and the termination efficiencies (TEs) of the seven terminators are all more than 90%. Six gRNA targets were designed upstream of the promoter and downstream of the terminator. Using a green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter, we confirmed integration efficiency with the single-locus integration site is up to 100%. We demonstrated the applicability of this toolkit by optimizing the expression of a challenging but industrially important product, lycopene. By heterologous expression of the essential genes for lycopene synthesis on the B. subtilis genome, a total of 13 key genes involved in the lycopene biosynthetic pathway were manipulated. Moreover, our findings showed that the gene cluster <i>ispG-idi</i>-<i>dxs</i>-<i>ispD</i> could positively affect the production of lycopene, while the cluster <i>dxr</i>-<i>ispE</i>-<i>ispF</i>-<i>ispH</i> had a negative effect on lycopene production. Hence, our multilocus integration strategy can facilitate the pathway assembly for production of complex chemicals and pharmaceuticals in B. subtilis. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> We present a toolkit that allows for rapid cloning procedures and one-step subcloning to move from plasmid-based expression to stable chromosome integration and expression in a production strain in less than a week. The utility of the customized tool was demonstrated by integrating the MEP (2C-methyl-d-erythritol-4-phosphate) pathway, part of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), and the hetero-lycopene biosynthesis genes by stable expression in the genome. The tool could be useful to engineer B. subtilis strains through diverse recombination events and ultimately improve its potential and scope of industrial application as biological chassis.",

Site-specific ncAA incorporation is typically enabled by orthogonal translation systems comprising a stop codon suppressing tRNA (typically UAG), an aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase, and an ncAA of interest. Unfortunately, methods to discover and characterize suppressor tRNAs are limited because of laborious and time-consuming workflows in living cells. In this work, we develop an<i>Escherichia coli</i> crude extract-based cell-free gene expression system to rapidly express and characterize functional suppressor tRNAs. Our approach co-expresses orthogonal tRNAs using endogenous machinery alongside a stop-codon containing superfolder green fluorescent protein (sfGFP) reporter, which can be used as a simple read-out for suppression. As a model, we evaluate the UAG and UAA suppressing activity of several orthogonal tRNAs. Then, we demonstrate that co-transcription of two mutually orthogonal tRNAs can direct the incorporation of two unique ncAAs within a single modified sfGFP. Finally, we show that the cell-free workflow can be used to discover putative UAG-suppressor tRNAs found in metagenomic data, which are nonspecifically recognized by endogenous aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. We anticipate that our cell-free system will accelerate the development of orthogonal translation systems for synthetic biology.",

Transgenic animals, although they can have brain-wide GECI expression, often express GECIs in only a small subset of neurons, may have abnormal behavioral phenotypes, and are currently limited to older generations of GECIs. Inspired by recent developments in the synthesis of AAVs that readily cross the blood brain barrier, we tested whether an alternative strategy of intravenously injecting AAV-PHP.eB is suitable for two-photon calcium imaging of neurons over many months after injection. We injected C57BL/6 J mice with AAV-PHP.eB-Synapsin-jGCaMP7s via the retro-orbital sinus. After allowing 5 to 34 weeks for expression, we performed conventional and widefield two-photon imaging of layers 2/3, 4 and 5 of the primary visual cortex. We found reproducible trial-by-trial neural responses and tuning properties consistent with known feature selectivity in the visual cortex.

Recent advances in fluorescent sensor technology and fiber photometry permit the measurement of dopamine binding correlates, which can divulge basic functions of dopamine signaling in non-striatal dopamine terminal regions, like the dorsal bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (dBNST). Here, we record GRAB<sub>DA</sub> signals in the dBNST during a Pavlovian lever autoshaping task. We observe greater Pavlovian cue-evoked dBNST GRAB<sub>DA</sub> signals in sign-tracking (ST) compared to goal-tracking/intermediate (GT/INT) rats and the magnitude of cue-evoked dBNST GRAB<sub>DA</sub> signals decreases immediately following reinforcer-specific satiety. When we deliver unexpected rewards or omit expected rewards, we find that dBNST dopamine signals encode bidirectional reward prediction errors in GT/INT rats, but only positive prediction errors in ST rats. Since sign- and goal-tracking approach strategies are associated with distinct drug relapse vulnerabilities, we examined the effects of experimenter-administered fentanyl on dBNST dopamine associative encoding. Systemic fentanyl injections do not disrupt cue discrimination but generally potentiate dBNST dopamine signals. These results reveal multiple dBNST dopamine correlates of learning and motivation that depend on the Pavlovian approach strategy employed.",

Labeled proteins are conjugated in situ with an exogenously supplied nucleophilic probe, which serves as a functional handle for subsequent affinity enrichment and mass spectrometry-based protein identification. From a panel of nucleophilic compounds, we identify biotin-conjugated aniline and propargyl amine as highly reactive probes. As a demonstration of the spatial specificity and depth of coverage in mammalian cells, we apply RinID in the mitochondrial matrix, capturing 477 mitochondrial proteins with 94% specificity. We further demonstrate the broad applicability of RinID in various subcellular compartments, including the nucleus and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The temporal control of RinID enables pulse-chase labeling of ER proteome in HeLa cells, which reveals substantially higher clearance rate for secreted proteins than ER resident proteins.",

The phenomenon of RNA interference (RNAi) inheritance in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is an effective model to investigate TEI that takes advantage of this model organism's short life cycle, self-propagation, and transparency. In RNAi inheritance, exposure of animals to RNAi leads to gene silencing and altered chromatin signatures at the target locus that persist for multiple generations in the absence of the initial trigger. This protocol describes the analysis of RNAi inheritance in C. elegans using a germline-expressed nuclear green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter. Reporter silencing is initiated by feeding the animals bacteria expressing double-stranded RNA targeting GFP. At each generation, animals are passaged to maintain synchronized development, and reporter gene silencing is determined by microscopy. At select generations, populations are collected and processed for chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) to measure histone modification enrichment at the GFP reporter locus. This protocol for studying RNAi inheritance can be easily modified and combined with other analyses to further investigate TEI factors in small RNA and chromatin pathways.",

        "abstract": "General anesthesia has long been used in clinical practice, but its precise pharmacological effects on neural circuits are not fully understood. Recent investigations suggest that the sleep-wake system may play a role in the reversible loss of consciousness induced by general anesthetics. Studies in mice have shown that microinjection of dopamine receptor 1 (D1R) agonists into the nucleus accumbens (NAc) promotes recovery from isoflurane anesthesia, while microinjection of D1R antagonists has the opposite effect. Furthermore, during the induction and maintenance of sevoflurane anesthesia, there is a significant decrease in extracellular dopamine levels in the NAc, which subsequently increases during the recovery period. These findings suggest the involvement of the NAc in the regulation of general anesthesia. However, the specific role of D1R-expressing neurons in the NAc during general anesthesia and the downstream effect pathways are still not well understood. In order to analyze the impact of sevoflurane anesthesia on NAc<sup>D1R</sup>  neurons and the NAc<sup>D1R</sup> -VP pathway, this study employed calcium fiber photometry to investigate alterations in the fluorescence intensity of calcium signals in dopamine D1-receptor-expressing neurons located in the nucleus accumbens (NAc<sup>D1R</sup>  neurons) and the NAc<sup>D1R</sup> -VP pathway during sevoflurane anesthesia. Subsequently, optogenetic techniques were utilized to activate or inhibit NAc<sup>D1R</sup>  neurons and their synaptic terminals in the ventral pallidum (VP), aiming to elucidate the role of NAc<sup>D1R</sup>  neurons and the NAc<sup>D1R</sup> -VP pathway in sevoflurane anesthesia. These experiments were supplemented with electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings and behavioral tests. Lastly, a genetically-encoded fluorescent sensor was employed to observe changes in extracellular GABA neurotransmitters in the VP during sevoflurane anesthesia. Our findings revealed that sevoflurane administration led to the inhibition of NAc<sup>D1R</sup> neuron population activity, as well as their connections within the ventral pallidum (VP). We also observed a reversible reduction in extracellular GABA levels in the VP during both the induction and emergence phases of sevoflurane anesthesia. Additionally, the optogenetic activation of NAc<sup>D1R</sup>  neurons and their synaptic terminals in the VP resulted in a promotion of wakefulness during sevoflurane anesthesia, accompanied by a decrease in EEG slow wave activity and burst suppression rate. Conversely, the optogenetic inhibition of the NAc<sup>D1R</sup> -VP pathway exerted opposite effects. The NAc<sup>D1R</sup> -VP pathway serves as a crucial downstream pathway of NAc<sup>D1R</sup> neurons, playing a significant role in regulating arousal during sevoflurane anesthesia. Importantly, this pathway appears to be associated with the release of GABA neurotransmitters from VP cells.",

Not all hairy roots induced by A. rhizogenes are transgenic, however, which leads to requirement of a binary vector to carry a reporter gene to distinguish transgenic roots from non-transformed hairy roots. The beta-glucuronidase gene (GUS) and fluorescent protein gene often are used as reporter markers in the process of hairy root transformation, but they require expensive chemical reagents or imaging equipment. Alternatively, AtMYB75, an R2R3 MYB transcription factor from Arabidopsis thaliana, recently has been used as a reporter gene in hairy root transformation in some leguminous plants and can cause anthocyanin accumulation in transgenic hairy roots. Whether AtMYB75 can be used as a reporter gene in the hairy roots of tomato and if the anthocyanins accumulating in the roots will affect AMF colonization, however, are still unknown. In this study, the one-step cutting method was used for tomato hairy root transformation by A.rhizogenes. It is faster and has a higher transformation efficiency than the conventional method. AtMYB75 was used as a reporter gene in tomato hairy root transformation. The results showed that the overexpression of AtMYB75 caused anthocyanin accumulation in the transformed hairy roots. Anthocyanin accumulation in the transgenic hairy roots did not affect their colonization by the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus, Funneliformis mosseae strain BGC NM04A, and there was no difference in the expression of the AMF colonization marker gene SlPT4 in AtMYB75 transgenic roots and wild-type roots.

Among different delivery approaches, gene delivery is touted as a promising strategy for the treatment of several nervous system disorders. The transfer of exogenous genetic elements is limited by the paucity of suitable carriers. As a correlate, designing high-efficiency biocarriers for gene delivery is challenging. This study aimed to deliver pEGFP-N1 plasmid into the brain parenchyma using CDX-modified chitosan (CS) nanoparticles (NPs). <i><b>Methods:</b></i> Herein, we attached CDX, a 16 amino acids peptide, to the CS polymer using bifunctional polyethylene glycol (PEG) formulated with sodium tripolyphosphate (TPP), by ionic gelation method.

In this protocol, we describe the use of a new series of transposons designed to obtain random fusions to either the <i>lacZY</i> operon or the gene for superfolder green fluorescent protein (sfGFP). Transposition is achieved through the activity of the hyperactive variant of Tn5 transposase (Tnp) whose gene is positioned in <i>cis</i> with respect to the transposable module and under the control of the anyhydrotetracycline (AHTc)-inducible P<sup>tet</sup> promoter. The transposable module comprises a promoter-less <i>lacZY</i> operon or the <i>sfGFP</i> gene, with or without the <i>lacZ</i> or <i>sfGFP</i> ribosome-binding site, plus a <i>kan</i> gene for selection. The transposon-transposase unit is harbored on an R6K-based suicide plasmid. The plasmid is introduced into recipient cells by electro-transformation and the synthesis of Tn5 Tnp is induced transiently by including AHTc in the recovery medium. Cells are then plated on kanamycin-supplemented medium (without AHTc) where the plasmid DNA is lost and only cells in which transposition has occurred can form colonies. Fusions are detected by screening for colony color on lactose indicator plates (<i>lacZ</i> transposition) or monitoring green fluorescence (<i>sfGFP</i> transposition). Depending on whether the reporter gene carries or lacks the ribosome binding sequence, the fusions obtained will either be transcriptional or translational.

The stress-responsive whole-cell biosensor is a powerful tool to evaluate direct or indirect damages of biological macromolecules induced by toxic chemicals. In this proof-of-concept study, nine well-characterized stress-responsive promoters were first selected to assemble a set of blue indigoidine-based biosensors. The PuspA-based, PfabA-based, and PgrpE-based biosensors were eliminated due to their high background. A dose-dependent increase of visible blue signal was observed in PrecA-, PkatG-, and PuvrA-based biosensors, responsive to potent mutagens, including mitomycin and nalidixic acid, but not to genotoxic lead and cadmium. The PrecA, PkatG, and Ppgi gene promoters were further fused to a purple deoxyviolacein synthetic enzyme cluster. Although high basal production of deoxyviolacein is unavoidable, an enhanced visible purple signal in response to mitomycin and nalidixic acid was observed as dose-dependent, especially in PkatG-based biosensors. The study shows that a set of stress-responsive biosensors employing visible pigment as a reporter is pre-validating in detecting extensive DNA damage and intense oxidative stress.

        "abstract": "Magnetic cell sorting technology stands out because of its speed, simplicity, and ability to process large cell numbers. However, it also suffers from a number of drawbacks, in particular low discrimination power, which results in all-or-none selection outcomes limited to a bulk separation of cell populations into positive and negative fractions, as well as the modest purity of the selected cells and the inability to select subpopulations of cells with high expression of a surface marker. In the present study, we developed a simple solution to this problem and confirmed the effectiveness of this approach by multiple experiments with the magnetic selection of transduced cell populations. Murine NIH 3T3 cells were transduced with the bicistronic retroviral vector constructs co-expressing fluorescent reporter proteins EGFP (enhanced green fluorescent protein) or DsRed-Express 2 and LNGFR (low-affinity nerve growth factor receptor) as surface selection markers. The effects of the magnetic selection of transduced cells with anti-LNGFR Micro Bead (MB) doses ranging from 0.5 to 80 µL have been assessed. Low doses of MBs favored the depletion of weakly positive cells from the population, resulting in the higher expression levels of EGFP or DsRed-Express2 reporters in the selected cell fractions. Low MB doses also contributed to the increased purity of the selected population, even for samples with a low initial percentage of positive cells. At the same time, high MB doses resulted in the increased yield and a more faithful representation of the original expression profiles following selection. We further demonstrate that for populations with fairly narrow distribution of expression levels, it is possible to achieve separation into high- and low-expressing subsets using the two-stage selection scheme based on the sequential use of low and high doses of MBs. For populations with broad expression distribution, a one-stage selection with low or high doses of MBs is sufficient for a clear separation of low- and high-expressing subsets in the column-retained and flow-through fractions, respectively. This study substantially extends the potential of magnetic cell sorting, and may open new possibilities in a number of biomedical applications.",

        "abstract": "Flexible electronics have gained great attention in recent years owing to their promising applications in biomedicine, sustainable energy, human-machine interaction, and toys for children. Paper mainly produced from cellulose fibers is attractive substrate for flexible electronics because it is biodegradable, foldable, tailorable, and light-weight. Inspired by daily handwriting, the rapid prototyping of sensing devices with arbitrary patterns can be achieved by directly drawing conductive inks on flat or curved paper surfaces; this provides huge freedom for children to design and integrate \"do-it-yourself (DIY)\" electronic toys. Herein, viscous and additive-free ink made from Ti<sub>3</sub> C<sub>2</sub> T<sub>X</sub> MXene sediment is employed to prepare disposable paper electronics through a simple ball pen drawing. The as-drawn paper sensors possess hierarchical microstructures with interweaving nanosheets, nanoflakes, and nanoparticles, therefore exhibiting superior mechanosensing performances to those based on single/fewer-layer MXene nanosheets. As proof-of-concept applications, several popular children's games are implemented by the MXene-based paper sensors, including \"You say, I guess,\" \"Emotional expression,\" \"Rock-Paper-Scissors,\" \"Arm wrestling,\" \"Throwing game,\" \"Carrot squat,\" and \"Grab the cup,\" as well as a DIY smart whisker for a cartoon mouse. Moreover, MXene-based paper sensors are safe and disposable, free from producing any e-waste and hazard to the environment.",

Control of ZYMV by cross-protection has been practised for decades, but selecting useful mild viruses is time-consuming and laborious. Most attenuated potyviruses used for cross-protection do not induce hypersensitive reaction (HR) in Chenopodium quinoa, a local lesion host Chenopodium quinoa. Here, severe ZYMV TW-TN3 tagged with green fluorescent protein (GFP), designated ZG, was used for nitrous acid mutagenesis. From three trials, 11 mutants were identified from fluorescent spots without HR in inoculated C. quinoa leaves. Five mutants caused attenuated symptoms in squash plants. The genomic sequences of these five mutants revealed that most of the nonsynonymous changes were located in the HC-Pro gene. The replacement of individual mutated HC-Pros in the ZG backbone and an RNA silencing suppression (RSS) assay indicated that each mutated HC-Pro is defective in RSS function and responsible for reduced virulence. Four mutants provided high degrees of protection (84%-100%) against severe virus TW-TN3 in zucchini squash plants, with ZG 4-10 being selected for removal of the GFP tag. After removal of the GFP gene, Z 4-10 induced symptoms similar to ZG 4-10 and still provided 100% protection against TW-TN3 in squash, thus is considered not a genetically engineered mutant. Therefore, using a GFP reporter to select non-HR mutants of ZYMV from C. quinoa leaves is an efficient way to obtain beneficial mild viruses for cross-protection. This novel approach is being applied to other potyviruses.",

In addition, the efficiency of using this method for long fragment knockout is low. To simplify the process of gene manipulation, we constructed a minimized integrative vector pln2. When a gene needs to be inactivated, an internal fragment of the target gene (non-frameshift) is cloned into the pln2 plasmid. Once the single-crossover recombination between genome and the constructed plasmid occurs, the endogenous gene is segmented by the plasmid backbone and thus inactivated.

The discovery and targeted creation of new antibiotics are today among the most important public health issues. Antibiotics based on antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are of particular interest due to their genetically encoded nature. A distinct advantage of most AMPs is their direct mechanism of action that is mediated by their membranolytic properties. The low rate of emergence of antibiotic resistance associated with the killing mechanism of action of AMPs attracts heightened attention to this field. Recombinant technologies enable the creation of genetically programmable AMP producers for large-scale generation of recombinant AMPs (rAMPs) or the creation of rAMP-producing biocontrol agents. The methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris was genetically modified for the secreted production of rAMP. Constitutive expression of the sequence encoding the mature AMP protegrin-1 provided the yeast strain that effectively inhibits the growth of target gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. An antimicrobial effect was also observed in the microculture when a yeast rAMP producer and a reporter bacterium were co-encapsulated in droplets of microfluidic double emulsion. The heterologous production of rAMPs opens up new avenues for creating effective biocontrol agents and screening antimicrobial activity using ultrahigh-throughput technologies.",

        "abstract": "Restoring function in chronic stages of spinal cord injury (SCI) has often been met with failure or reduced efficacy when regenerative strategies are delayed past the acute or sub-acute stages of injury. Restoring function in the chronically injured spinal cord remains a critical challenge. We found that a single injection of retrogradely transported adeno-associated viruses (AAVrg) to knockout the phosphatase and tensin homolog protein (PTEN) in chronic SCI can effectively target both damaged and spared axons and restore locomotor functions in near-complete injury models. AAVrg's were injected to deliver cre recombinase and/or a red fluorescent protein (RFP) under the human Synapsin 1 promoter (hSyn1) into the spinal cords of C57BL/6 PTEN <sup>FloxΔ</sup> / <sup>Δ</sup> mice to knockout PTEN (PTEN-KO) in a severe thoracic SCI crush model at both acute and chronic time points. PTEN-KO improved locomotor abilities in both acute and chronic SCI conditions over a 9-week period. Regardless of whether treatment was initiated at the time of injury (acute), or three months after SCI (chronic), mice with limited hindlimb joint movement gained hindlimb weight support after treatment. Interestingly, functional improvements were not sustained beyond 9 weeks coincident with a loss of RFP reporter-gene expression and a near-complete loss of treatment-associated functional recovery by 6 months post-treatment. Treatment effects were also specific to severely injured mice; animals with weight support at the time of treatment lost function over a 6-month period. Retrograde tracing with Fluorogold revealed viable neurons throughout the motor cortex despite a loss of RFP expression at 9 weeks post-PTEN-KO. However, few Fluorogold labeled neurons were detected within the motor cortex at 6 months post-treatment. BDA labeling from the motor cortex revealed a dense corticospinal tract (CST) bundle in all groups except chronically treated PTEN-KO mice indicating a potential long-term toxic effect of PTEN-KO to neurons in the motor cortex. PTEN-KO mice had significantly more β <b>-</b> tubulin III labeled axons within the lesion when treatment was delivered acutely, but not chronically post-SCI. In conclusion, we have found that using AAVrg's to knockout PTEN is an effective manipulation capable of restoring motor functions in chronic SCI and can enhance axon growth of currently unidentified axon populations when delivered acutely after injury. However, the long-term consequences of PTEN-KO may exert neurotoxic effects.",

Boehm et al. suggested that c-di-GMP-activated YcgR directly interacted with the motor protein MotA to curb flagellar motor output. Paul et al. proposed that YcgR disrupted the organization of the FliG C-terminal domain to bias the flagellar rotation. The target proteins are controversial, and the role of motor proteins remains unclear in flagellar rotation speed and direction regulation by YcgR. Here we assayed the motor proteins' affinity via a modified FRET biosensor and accessed the role of those key residue via bead assays. We found that YcgR could interact with both MotA and FliG, and the affinities could be enhanced upon c-di-GMP binding. Furthermore, residue D54 of YcgR-N was needed for FliG binding. The mutation of the FliG binding residue D54 or the MotA binding ones, F117 and E232, restored flagellar rotation speed in wild-type cells and cells lacking chemotaxis response regulator CheY that switched the flagellar rotation direction and decreased the CCW ratio in wild-type cells. We propose that c-di-GMP-activated YcgR regulated the flagellar rotation speed and direction via its interaction with motor proteins MotA and FliG.

Using immunofluorescence approaches, we investigated whether cremaster MNs also exhibit features reflecting their potential for electrical synaptic communication and examined some of their other synaptic characteristics. Both mice and rats displayed punctate immunolabelling of Cx36 associated with cremaster MNs, indicative of gap junction formation. Transgenic mice with enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) reporter for connexin36 expression showed that subpopulations of cremaster MNs in both male and female mice express eGFP, with greater proportions of those in male mice. The eGFP<sup>+</sup> MNs within the cremaster nucleus vs. eGFP<sup>-</sup> MNs inside and outside this nucleus displayed a 5-fold greater density of serotonergic innervation and exhibited a paucity of innervation by C-terminals arising from cholinergic V0c interneurons.

After tamoxifen inducement, the two groups of Gli1<sup>+</sup>-MSC were screened by green fluorescent protein (GFP) labeling and flow cytometry sorting. PDGFRα was conditionally knocked out in the experimental group, and the control group Gli1<sup>+</sup>-MSC expressed PDGFRα normally. The two groups of Gli1<sup>+</sup>-MSC were subjected to adipogenic induction and fibrogenic induction, the Western blotting was performed to detect PDGFRα, adipocyte markers [perilipin and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha (C/EBPα)] and fibrogenic markers [alpha smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and fibroblast-specific protein 1 (FSP-1)] and semi-quantitative analysis was performed. The degree of cellular adipose differentiation after bidirectional induction of Gli1+-MSC in both groups was observed by oil red O staining and analyzed semi-quantitatively. <b>Results:</b> After tamoxifen induction, Gli1<sup>+</sup>-MSC could be accurately isolated from flow cytometry by GFP labeling. Via adipogenic differentiation, the expression of PDGFRα in the experimental group (0.017±0.002) was significantly lower than that in the control group (0.184±0.012) (<i>t</i>=25.48，<i>P</i>=0.002). The protein expressions of perilipin (3.138±0.414) and C/EBPα (3.565±0.289) were significantly higher than those in the control group (2.312±0.218 and 2.179±0.103, respectively) (<i>t</i>=6.21，<i>P</i>=0.025；<i>t</i>=6.69，<i>P</i>=0.022). Thus, the knock-out of PDGFRα enhanced the adipogenic differentiation ability of Gli1<sup>+</sup>-MSC. After fibrogenesis induction, the protein expressions of PDGFRα, α-SMA and FSP-1 in the experimental group (0.030±0.001, 0.932±0.177 and 0.276±0.020, respectively) were significantly lower than those in the control group (0.439±0.006, 1.352±0.170 and 0.835±0.097, respectively) (<i>t</i>=149.40, <i>P</i><0.001; <i>t</i>=66.38,<i>P</i><0.001; <i>t</i>=11.41,<i>P<</i>0.08). This suggested that the knock-out of PDGFRα significantly inhibited Gli1<sup>+</sup>-MSC differentiation toward fibroblasts. After bidirectional induction, significantly less adipocyte formation was seen in the control group and more in the experimental group. Quantitative analysis showed that the amount of oil red O staining in the experimental group (0.461±0.042) was significantly higher than that in the control group (0.017±0.007) after bidirectional induction (<i>t</i>=23.20, <i>P<</i>0.01). <b>Conclusions:</b> PDGFRα plays an important role in the regulation of bidirectional differentiation of vascular adventitial Gli1+-MSC.",

In this study, the wild-type P. chrysogenum VTCC 31172 strain was re-classified as P. rubens by a multilocus sequencing analysis. Further, the pyrG gene required for uridine/uracil biosynthesis was successfully deleted in the VTCC 31172 strain by homologous recombination to generate a stable uridine/uracil auxotrophic mutant (ΔpyrG). The growth of the P. rubens ΔpyrG strain could be restored by uridine/uracil supplementation, and a new ATMT system based on the uridine/uracil auxotrophic mechanism was established for this strain. The optimal ATMT efficiency could reach 1750 transformants for 10<sup>6</sup> spores (equivalent to 0.18%). In addition, supplementation of uridine/uracil at the concentrations of 0.005-0.02% during the co-cultivation process significantly promoted transformation efficiency. Especially, we demonstrated that the pyrG marker and the amyB promoter from the koji mold Aspergillus oryzae were fully functional in P. rubens ΔpyrG. Expression of the DsRed reporter gene under the regulation of the A. oryzae amyB promoter lighted up the mycelium of P. rubens with a robust red signal under fluorescence microscopy. Furthermore, genomic integration of multiple copies of the Aspergillus fumigatus phyA gene under the control of the amyB promoter significantly enhanced phytase activity in P. rubens. The ATMT system developed in our work provides a safe genetic platform for producing recombinant products in P. rubens without using drug resistance markers.",

        "abstract": "Cell-free protein expression systems are here combined with 3D-printed structures to study the challenges and opportunities as biofabrication enters the spaces of architecture and design. Harnessing large-scale additive manufacturing of biological materials, we examined the addition of cell-free protein expression systems (\"TXTL\" i.e., biological transcription-translation machinery without the use of living cells) to printed structures. This allowed us to consider programmable, living-like, responsive systems for product design and indoor architectural applications. This emergent, pluripotent technology offers exciting potential in support of health, resource optimization, and reduction of energy use in the built environment, setting a new path to interactivity with mechanical, optical, and (bio) chemical properties throughout structures. We propose a roadmap towards creating healthier, functional and more durable systems by deploying a multiscale platform containing biologically-active components encapsulated within biopolymer lattices operating at three design scales: (i) supporting cell-free protein expression in a biopolymer matrix (microscale), (ii) varying material properties of porosity and strength within two-dimensional lattices to support biological and structural functions (mesoscale), and (iii) obtaining folded indoor surfaces that are structurally sound at the meter scale and biologically active (we label that regime macroscale). We embedded commercially available cell-free protein expression systems within silk fibroin and sodium alginate biopolymer matrices and used green fluorescent protein as the reporter to confirm their compatibility. We demonstrate mechanical attachment of freeze-dried bioactive pellets into printed foldable fibrous biopolymer lattices showing the first steps towards modular multiscale fabrication of large structures with biologically active zones.

Although sophisticated regulatory networks maintain proper homeostasis to prevent damage, the tolerance thresholds to these stresses vary significantly among organisms. Current plant phenotyping techniques and observables must be better suited to characterize the real-time metabolic response to stresses. This impedes practical agronomic intervention to avoid irreversible damage and limits our ability to breed improved plant organisms. Here, we introduce a sensitive, wearable electrochemical glucose-selective sensing platform that addresses these problems. Glucose is a primary plant metabolite, a source of energy produced during photosynthesis, and a critical molecular modulator of various cellular processes ranging from germination to senescence. The wearable-like technology integrates a reverse iontophoresis glucose extraction capability with an enzymatic glucose biosensor that offers a sensitivity of 22.7 nA/(μM·cm<sup>2</sup>), a limit of detection (LOD) of 9.4 μM, and a limit of quantification (LOQ) of 28.5 μM. The system's performance was validated by subjecting three different plant models (sweet pepper, gerbera, and romaine lettuce) to low-light and low-high temperature stresses and demonstrating critical differential physiological responses associated with their glucose metabolism. This technology enables non-invasive, non-destructive, real-time, in-situ, and in-vivo identification of early stress response in plants and provides a unique tool for timely agronomic management of crops and improving breeding strategies based on the dynamics of genome-metabolome-phenome relationships.",

They are often used as genetically encoded biosensors with applications ranging from the detection of environmental contaminants and biomarkers to microbial strain engineering. Despite our efforts to expand the space of compounds that can be detected using biosensors, the identification and characterization of transcription factors and their corresponding inducer molecules remain labor- and time-intensive tasks. Here, we introduce TFBMiner, a new data mining and analysis pipeline that enables the automated and rapid identification of putative metabolite-responsive transcription factor-based biosensors (TFBs). This user-friendly command line tool harnesses a heuristic rule-based model of gene organization to identify both gene clusters involved in the catabolism of user-defined molecules and their associated transcriptional regulators. Ultimately, biosensors are scored based on how well they fit the model, providing wet-lab scientists with a ranked list of candidates that can be experimentally tested. We validated the pipeline using a set of molecules for which TFBs have been reported previously, including sensors responding to sugars, amino acids, and aromatic compounds, among others. We further demonstrated the utility of TFBMiner by identifying a biosensor for S-mandelic acid, an aromatic compound for which a responsive transcription factor had not been found previously. Using a combinatorial library of mandelate-producing microbial strains, the newly identified biosensor was able to distinguish between low- and high-producing strain candidates.

Here, bioluminescent reporters for the maternally-expressed imprinted gene Cdkn1c are used to examine the capacity of chromatin-modifying drugs to reverse paternal Cdkn1c silencing. Exposure of reporter mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) to 5-Azacytidine, HDAC inhibitors, BET inhibitors or GSK-J4 (KDM6A/B inhibitor) relieved repression of paternal Cdkn1c, either selectively or by inducing biallelic effects. Treatment of reporter fibroblasts with HDAC inhibitors or GSK-J4 resulted in similar paternal Cdkn1c activation, whereas BET inhibitor-induced loss of imprinting was specific to mESCs. Changes in allelic expression were generally not sustained in dividing cultures upon drug removal, indicating that the underlying epigenetic memory of silencing was maintained. In contrast, Cdkn1c de-repression by GSK-J4 was retained in both mESCs and fibroblasts following inhibitor removal, although this impact may be linked to cellular stress and DNA damage. Taken together, these data introduce bioluminescent reporter cells as tools for studying epigenetic silencing and disruption, and demonstrate that Cdkn1c imprinting requires distinct and cell-type specific chromatin features and modifying enzymes to enact and propagate a memory of silencing.",

        "abstract": "Activated glia are known to exhibit either neuroprotective or neurodegenerative effects, depending on their phenotype, while participating in chronic pain regulation. Until recently, it has been believed that satellite glial cells and astrocytes are electrically slight and process stimuli only through intracellular calcium flux that triggers downstream signaling mechanisms. Though glia do not exhibit action potentials, they do express both voltage- and ligand-gated ion channels that facilitate measurable calcium transients, a measure of their own phenotypic excitability, and support and modulate sensory neuron excitability through ion buffering and secretion of excitatory or inhibitory neuropeptides (i.e., paracrine signaling). We recently developed a model of acute and chronic nociception using co-cultures of iPSC sensory neurons (SN) and spinal astrocytes on microelectrode arrays (MEAs). Until recently, only neuronal extracellular activity has been recorded using MEAs with a high signal-to-noise ratio and in a non-invasive manner. Unfortunately, this method has limited compatibility with simultaneous calcium transient imaging techniques, which is the most common method for monitoring the phenotypic activity of astrocytes. Moreover, both dye-based and genetically encoded calcium indicator imaging rely on calcium chelation, affecting the culture's long-term physiology. Therefore, it would be ideal to allow continuous and simultaneous direct phenotypic monitoring of both SNs and astrocytes in a high-to-moderate throughput non-invasive manner and would significantly advance the field of electrophysiology. Here, we characterize astrocytic oscillating calcium transients (OCa<sup>2+</sup>Ts) in mono- and co-cultures of iPSC astrocytes as well as iPSC SN-astrocyte co-cultures on 48 well plate MEAs. We demonstrate that astrocytes exhibit OCa<sup>2+</sup>Ts in an electrical stimulus amplitude- and duration-dependent manner. We show that OCa<sup>2+</sup>Ts can be pharmacologically inhibited with the gap junction antagonist, carbenoxolone (100 μM). Most importantly, we demonstrate that both neurons and glia can be phenotypically characterized in real time, repeatedly, over the duration of the culture. In total, our findings suggest that calcium transients in glial populations may serve as a stand-alone or supplemental screening technique for identifying potential analgesics or compounds targeting other glia-mediated pathologies.",

Both M-P1 and P2-S can specifically conjugate with S.T to form a magnetic sandwich complex. After magnetic separation, the isolated complex can emit a fluorescent signal under an excited 365 nm laser, which can reflect the total amount of S.T. Afterwards, the lysozyme was added to decompose the captured live S.T, which can release ATP and produce a bioluminescent signal corresponding to the live S.T amount. The dead S.T concentration can be deduced by the difference between total and live examples. The detection limit of 55 CFU/mL for total S.T and 9 CFU/mL for live ones was within 20 min.

We introduced NADPH challenges in either the cytosol or mitochondria of cells by using isocitrate dehydrogenase mutations, administering chemotherapeutics or with genetically encoded NADPH oxidase. We found that cytosolic challenges influenced NADPH fluxes in the cytosol but not NADPH fluxes in mitochondria, and vice versa. This work highlights the value of using proline labeling as a reporter system to study compartmentalized metabolism and reveals that NADPH homeostasis in the cytosolic and mitochondrial locations of a cell are independently regulated, with no evidence for NADPH shuttle activity.",

Therefore, developing safe and effective delivery vehicles is critical for fundamental biomedical research and clinical applications. In this study, we designed an octopus-like self-releasing intracellular protein transporter, the LEB5, based on the heat-labile enterotoxin. This carrier comprises five identical units, each of which has three main components: a linker, a self-releasing enzyme sensitivity loop, and the LTB transport domain. The LEB5 comprises five purified monomers that self-assemble to create a pentamer with ganglioside GM1 binding capacity. The fluorescent protein EGFP was used as a reporter system to identify the LEB5 features. The high-purity fusion protein ELEB monomer was produced from modified bacteria carrying pET24a(+)-eleb recombinant plasmids. EGFP protein could effectively detach from LEB5 by low dosage trypsin, according to electrophoresis analysis. The transmission electron microscopy results indicate that both LEB5 and ELEB5 pentamers exhibit a relatively regularly spherical shape, and the differential scanning calorimetry measurements further suggest that these proteins possess excellent thermal stability. Fluorescence microscopy revealed that LEB5 translocated EGFP into different cell types. Flow cytometry showed cellular differences in the transport capacity of LEB5. According to the confocal microscopy, fluorescence analysis and western blotting data, EGFP was transferred to the endoplasmic reticulum by the LEB5 carrier, detached from LEB5 by cleavage of the enzyme-sensitive loop, and released into the cytoplasm. Within the dosage range of LEB5 10-80 μg/mL, cell counting kit-8 assay revealed no significant changes in cell viability. These results demonstrated that LEB5 is a safe and effective intracellular self-releasing delivery vehicle capable of transporting and releasing protein medicines into cells.",

Transgenic animals, although they can have brain-wide GECI expression, often express GECIs in only a small subset of neurons, may have abnormal behavioral phenotypes, and are currently limited to older generations of GECIs. Inspired by recent developments in the synthesis of AAVs that readily cross the blood brain barrier, we tested whether an alternative strategy of intravenously injecting AAV-PhP.eB is suitable for two-photon calcium imaging of neurons over many months after injection. We injected young (postnatal day 23 to 31) C57BL/6J mice with AAV-PhP.eB-Synapsin-jGCaMP7s via the retro-orbital sinus. After allowing 5 to 34 weeks for expression, we performed conventional and widefield two-photon imaging of layers 2/3, 4 and 5 of the primary visual cortex. We found reproducible trial-by-trial neural responses and tuning properties consistent with known feature selectivity in the visual cortex. Thus, intravenous injection of AAV-PhP.eB does not interfere with the normal processing in neural circuits. <i>In vivo</i> and histological images show no nuclear expression of jGCaMP7s for at least 34 weeks post-injection.",

The \"Gene Pulser XCell,\" a modular electroporation system for transfecting all cell types, has not been used extensively in mammalian embryo genome editing. The present experiment was undertaken to determine the usefulness of the Gene Pulser XCell for inserting the CRISPR/Cas9 system into intact zygotes in order to obtain the enhanced green fluorescent protein reporter rats (eGFP-R). An electroporation pulse response test using mCherry mRNA was performed to optimize the settings of the electroporator. Forty-five combinations of five pulse voltages (15, 25, 30, 35 and 40 V), three pulse durations (5, 10 and 25 ms), and three pulse frequencies (2, 5 and 6 pulses) applied at a constant 100-ms pulse interval and temperature of 37.5 °C were evaluated. The test revealed that the 35 V was the only voltage suitable for insertion of mCherry mRNA into intact rat zygotes and the only one that resulted in the production of embryos attaining the blastocyst stage. The incorporation of mCherry mRNA increased but the survival of the electroporated embryos declined with an increment in the number of pulses. Subsequent transfer of 1112 surviving Sprague Dawley rat embryos (after 8 h of incubating 1800 zygotes electroporated with the CRISPR/Cas9) resulted in the production of 287 offspring (25.8%). Ensuing PCR and phenotypic evaluation confirmed that twenty animals (6.96%) expressed eGFP in all body organs/tissues except for blood and blood vessels. The mortality of males and females before the attainment of puberty was 2 and 3 pups, respectively, and the final number/ratio of male to female of offspring was 9:11. All the surviving rats mated naturally and successfully transmitted the GFP transgene to their progeny.

Osteocytes, dendritic cells that form a syncytium throughout the bone, are responsible for the mechanosensory function of bone tissue. Studies employing histology, mathematical modeling, cell culture, and ex vivo bone organ cultures have greatly advanced the understanding of osteocyte mechanobiology. However, the fundamental question of how osteocytes respond to and encode mechanical information at the molecular level in vivo is not well understood. Intracellular calcium concentration fluctuations in osteocytes offer a useful target for learning more about acute bone mechanotransduction mechanisms. Here, we report a method for studying osteocyte mechanobiology in vivo, combining a mouse strain with a fluorescently genetically encoded calcium indicator expressed in osteocytes with an in vivo loading and imaging system to directly detect osteocyte calcium levels during loading. This is achieved with a three-point bending device that can deliver well-defined mechanical loads to the third metatarsal of living mice while simultaneously monitoring fluorescently indicated calcium responses of osteocytes using two-photon microscopy. This technique allows for direct in vivo observation of osteocyte calcium signaling events in response to whole bone loading and is useful in the endeavor to reveal mechanisms in osteocyte mechanobiology.",

The molecular chains present a vertical orientation to the membrane, and the ions travel between the quasi-planar molecular sheets.

One important challenge to be still solved is how UCNPs can be optimally implemented into Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) biosensing and bioimaging for highly sensitive, wash-free, multiplexed, accurate, and precise quantitative analysis of biomolecules and biomolecular interactions. The many possible UCNP architectures composed of a core and multiple shells doped with different lanthanoid ions at different ratios, the interaction with FRET acceptors at different possible distances and orientations via biomolecular interaction, and the many and long-lasting energy transfer pathways from the initial UCNP excitation to the final FRET process and acceptor emission make the experimental determination of the ideal UCNP-FRET configuration for optimal analytical performance a real challenge. To overcome this issue, we have developed a fully analytical model that requires only a few experimental configurations to determine the ideal UCNP-FRET system within a few minutes. We verified our model via experiments using nine different Nd-, Yb-, and Er-doped core-shell-shell UCNP architectures within a prototypical DNA hybridization assay using Cy3.5 as an acceptor dye. Using the selected experimental input, the model determined the optimal UCNP out of all theoretically possible combinatorial configurations.

The hawthorn spider mite, Amphitetranychus viennensis Zacher, is a major pest for rosaceous plants, which has been controlled primarily by synthetic pesticides. To address the emerging resistance issues in A. viennensis, we initiated a project to develop RNAi-based biopesticides. In this study, we (i) developed a dietary RNAi system for A. viennensis using leaf disc, (ii) assessed the suitability of multiple control genes to distinguish sequence-specific silencing from non-specific effects within this RNAi system, and (iii) screened for the target gene candidates. As a result, β-Glucuronidase (GUS), an enzyme derived from E. coli and a broadly used reporter for plants is the appropriate control for A. viennensis RNAi, while green fluorescent protein (GFP), is not suitable due to its significantly higher mortality than the other controls. For target gene screening, suppression was confirmed for all the candidates, including two housekeeping genes (Vacuolar-type H + -ATPase subunit A (V-ATPase A) and Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, (GAPDH)), and three genes associated with development (ATP-dependent RNA Helicase DDX3Y (Belle), CREB-binding protein (CBP), and Farnesoic acid O-methyltransferase (FaMet)). Knocking down of V-ATPase A resulted in the highest mortality (~ 90%) and reduced fecundity (over 90%) than other candidates. As for the genes associated with development, suppression of Belle and CBP, led to approximately 65% mortality, as well as 86% and 40% reduction in fecundity, respectively. Silencing of FaMet, however, had negligible biological impacts on A. viennensis.

We focused on 18 hit compounds, from which we identified eight structurally unique compounds and four compound classes as SERCA modulators, approximately half of which are activators and half are inhibitors.

        "abstract": "Chikungunya fever is a mosquito-transmitted infectious disease that induces rash, myalgia, and persistent incapacitating arthralgia. At present, no vaccines or antiviral therapies specific to Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) infection have been approved, and research is currently restricted to biosafety level 3 containment. CHIKV-like replicon particles (VRPs) are single-cycle infectious particles containing viral structure proteins, as well as a defective genome to provide a safe surrogate for living CHIKV to facilitate the testing of vaccines and antivirals. However, inefficient RNA transfection and the potential emergence of the competent virus through recombination in mammalian cells limit VRP usability. This study describes a transfection-free system for the safe packaging of CHIK VRP with all necessary components via transduction of mosquito cell lines using a single baculovirus vector. We observed the release of substantial quantities of mosquito cell-derived CHIK VRP (mos-CHIK VRP) from baculovirus-transduced mosquito cell lines. The VRPs were shown to recapitulate viral replication and subgenomic dual reporter expression (enhanced green fluorescent protein [eGFP] and luciferase) in infected host cells. Interestingly, the rapid expression kinetics of the VRP-expressing luciferase reporter (6 h) makes it possible to use mos-CHIK VRPs for the rapid quantification of VRP infection. Treatment with antivirals (suramin or 6-azauridine) or neutralizing antibodies (monoclonal antibodies [MAbs] or patient sera) was shown to inhibit mos-CHIK VRP infection in a dose-dependent manner. Ease of manufacture, safety, scalability, and high throughput make mos-CHIK VRPs a highly valuable vehicle for the study of CHIKV biology, the detection of neutralizing (NT) antibody activity, and the screening of antivirals against CHIKV. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> This study proposes a transfection-free system that enables the safe packaging of CHIK VRPs with all necessary components via baculovirus transduction. Those mosquito cell-derived CHIK VRP (mos-CHIK VRPs) were shown to recapitulate viral replication and subgenomic dual reporter (enhanced green fluorescent protein [eGFP] and luciferase) expression in infected host cells. Rapid expression kinetics of the VRP-expressing luciferase reporter (within hours) opens the door to using mos-CHIK VRPs for the rapid quantification of neutralizing antibody and antiviral activity against CHIKV. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to report a mosquito cell-derived alphavirus VRP system. Note that this system could also be applied to other arboviruses to model the earliest event in arboviral infection in vertebrates.",

A range of PEI derivatives were designed, synthesized, and evaluated for nonviral delivery applications of plasmid DNA (pDNA).

The particle analysis determined that GA- and PHPA-modified lipopolymers gave pDNA complexes with ∼300 and ∼100 nm in size, respectively. At the polymer/pDNA ratio of 5.0, the ζ-potentials of the complexes were negative (-6.55 to -10.6 mV) unlike the complexes with the native PEI (+11.2 mV). The transfection experiments indicated that the prepared lipopolymers showed higher transfection in attachment-dependent cells than in suspension cells based on the expression of the reporter green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene. When loaded with Cy3-labeled pDNA, the lipopolymers exhibited effective cellular uptake in attachment-dependent cells while the cellular uptake was limited in suspension cells.

We have therefore adapted a method of B cell immortalization for use with RM B cells. In this system, RM B cells are activated with CD40 ligand and RM IL-21 before transduction with a retroviral vector encoding Bcl-6, Bcl-xL, and green fluorescent protein. Importantly, RM B cells from lymph nodes are more effectively immortalized by this method than B cells from PBMC, a difference not seen in humans. We suggest the discrepancy between these two tissues is due to increased expression of CD40 on RM lymph node B cells. Immortalized RM B cells expand long-term, undergo minimal somatic hypermutation, express surface B cell receptor, and secrete antibodies into culture. This allows for the identification of cells based on antigen specificity and/or functional assays. Here, we show the characterization of this system and its application for the isolation of HIV-1 neutralizing antibodies from a SHIV.CH505-infected animal, both with and without antigen probe. Taken together, we show that Bcl-6/xL immortalization is a valuable and flexible tool for antibody discovery in RMs, but with important distinctions from application of the system in human cells.",

Lentiviral transduction of bone marrow MSC with green fluorescent protein (GFP) and transgenes (sTRAIL and IL-12) was confirmed by fluorescence microscopy and Western blot. Soluble TRAIL levels were quantified by ELISA. Lymphoma L5178Y cells express a reporter gene (GFP/mCherry), and TRAIL receptor (DR5). An in vivo model showed that combined treatment with MSC expressing sTRAIL+IL-12 or IL-12 alone significantly reduced tumor volume and increased survival in BALB/c mice (<i>p</i> < 0.05) with only one application. However, at the histological level, only MSC expressing IL-12 reduced tumor cell infiltration significantly in the right gastrocnemius compared with the control group (<i>p</i> < 0.05).

MSC expressing IL-12, is or combination with BM-MSC expressing sTRAIL represents an antitumor strategy for lymphoma tumors since they increase survival and reduce tumor development.

Ex vivo stimulation of parvocellular OT axons in the vlPAG induced local OT release, as measured with OT sensor GRAB. In vivo, optogenetically-evoked axonal OT release in the vlPAG of as well as chemogenetic activation of OTR vlPAG neurons resulted in a long-lasting increase of vlPAG neuronal activity.

Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the key energetic barrier in the photo-deprotection reaction of the nitrophenyl protecting group is excitation of a π-π* transition (3.1 eV) <i>via</i> an intramolecular charge-transfer mechanism. Under modest loading, compression of the adsorbate layer causes a decrease in the N-N separation, with the effect that this energy barrier can be reduced to as little as 1.2 eV.

        "abstract": "Enteroendocrine cells are specialized sensory cells of the gut-brain axis that are sparsely distributed along the intestinal epithelium. The functions of enteroendocrine cells have classically been inferred by the gut hormones they release. However, individual enteroendocrine cells typically produce multiple, sometimes apparently opposing, gut hormones in combination, and some gut hormones are also produced elsewhere in the body. Here, we developed approaches involving intersectional genetics to enable selective access to enteroendocrine cells in vivo in mice. We targeted FlpO expression to the endogenous <i>Villin1</i> locus (in <i>Vil1-p2a-FlpO</i> knock-in mice) to restrict reporter expression to intestinal epithelium. Combined use of Cre and Flp alleles effectively targeted major transcriptome-defined enteroendocrine cell lineages that produce serotonin, glucagon-like peptide 1, cholecystokinin, somatostatin, or glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide. Chemogenetic activation of different enteroendocrine cell types variably impacted feeding behavior and gut motility. Defining the physiological roles of different enteroendocrine cell types provides an essential framework for understanding sensory biology of the intestine.",

In this study, we attempted genome editing using CRISPR/Cas9 (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR associated protein 9) system using this protein introduction technique. As an experimental system to evaluate genome editing, we utilized transgenic reporter plants carrying the reporter genes L-(I-SceI)-UC and sGFP-waxy-HPT. The L-(I-SceI)-UC system allowed the detection of successful genome editing by measuring the chemiluminescent signal observed upon re-functionalization of the luciferase (LUC) gene following genome editing. Similarly, the sGFP-waxy-HPT system conferred hygromycin resistance caused by hygromycin phosphotransferase (HPT) during genome editing. CRISPR/Cas9 ribonucleoproteins targeting these reporter genes were directly introduced into rice calli or tobacco leaf pieces after treatment with N2 and/or CO2 plasma. Cultivation of the treated rice calli on a suitable medium plate produced the luminescence signal, which was not observed in the negative control. Four types of genome-edited sequences were obtained upon sequencing the reporter genes of genome-edited candidate calli. sGFP-waxy-HPT-carrying tobacco cells exhibited hygromycin resistance during genome editing. After repeated cultivation of the treated tobacco leaf pieces on a regeneration medium plate, the calli were observed with leaf pieces. A green callus that was hygromycin-resistant was harvested, and a genome-edited sequence in the tobacco reporter gene was confirmed. As direct introduction of the Cas9/sgRNA (single guide RNA) complex using plasma enables genome editing in plants without any DNA introduction, this method is expected to be optimized for many plant species and may be widely applied for plant breeding in the future.",

These computations are performed by distinct types of neurons interconnected in circuits dedicated to the specialized roles of the auditory system. In the present study, we explored the use of voltage imaging to investigate CN circuitry. We tested two approaches based on fundamentally different voltage sensing technologies. Using a voltage-sensitive dye we recorded glutamate receptor-independent signals arising predominantly from axons. The mean conduction velocity of these fibers of 0.27 m/s was rapid but in range with other unmyelinated axons. We then used a genetically-encoded hybrid voltage sensor (hVOS) to image voltage from a specific population of neurons. Probe expression was controlled using Cre recombinase linked to <i>c-fos</i> activation. This activity-induced gene enabled targeting of neurons that are activated when a mouse hears a pure 15-kHz tone. In CN slices from these animals auditory nerve fiber stimulation elicited a glutamate receptor-dependent depolarization in hVOS probe-labeled neurons. These cells resided within a band corresponding to an isofrequency lamina, and responded with a high degree of synchrony. In contrast to the axonal origin of voltage-sensitive dye signals, hVOS signals represent predominantly postsynaptic responses. The introduction of voltage imaging to the CN creates the opportunity to investigate auditory processing circuitry in populations of neurons targeted on the basis of their genetic identity and their roles in sensory processing.",

        "abstract": "The formation of hyphae is a key virulence attribute of Candida albicans as they are required for adhesion to and invasion of host cells, and ultimately deep-tissue dissemination. Hyphae also secrete the peptide toxin candidalysin, which is crucial for destruction of host cell membranes. The peptide is derived from a precursor protein encoded by the gene <i>ECE1</i> which is strongly induced during hyphal growth. Previous studies revealed a very complex regulation of this gene involving several transcription factors. However, the promoter of the gene is still not characterized. Here, we present a functional analysis of the intergenic region upstream of the <i>ECE1</i> gene. Rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE)-PCR was performed to identify the 5' untranslated region, which has a size of 49 bp regardless of the hyphae-inducing condition. By using green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter constructs we further defined a minimal promoter length of 1,500 bp which was verified by RT-qPCR. Finally, we identified the TATA element required for the expression of the gene. It is located 106 to 109 bp upstream of the <i>ECE1</i> start codon. Our results illustrate that despite a very short 5' UTR, a relatively long promoter is required to secure <i>ECE1</i> transcription, indicating a complex regulatory machinery tightly controlling the expression of the gene. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> In recent years it was shown that secretion of the toxic peptide candidalysin from hyphae of the major human fungal pathogen Candida albicans contributes heavily to its virulence. The peptide is derived from a precursor protein which is encoded by the <i>ECE1</i> gene whose transcription is known to be closely associated with formation of hyphae. Here, we used a GFP reporter system to determine the length of the <i>ECE1</i> promoter and were able to show that it has a minimal size of 1,500 bp. Surprisingly, the gene has a very short 5' UTR of only 49 bp. In accordance with this, the TATA element required for transcription is located 106 to 109 bp upstream of the start codon. This indicates that <i>ECE1</i> expression is controlled by a very long promoter allowing a complex network of transcription factors to contribute to the gene's regulation.",

To determine whether loss of presynaptic CDKL5 function contributes to CDD, we examined synaptic vesicle (SV) recycling in primary hippocampal neurons generated from <i>Cdkl5</i> knockout rat males. Using a genetically encoded reporter, we revealed that CDKL5 is selectively required for efficient SV endocytosis. We showed that CDKL5 kinase activity is both necessary and sufficient for optimal SV endocytosis, since kinase-inactive mutations failed to correct endocytosis in <i>Cdkl5</i> knockout neurons, whereas the isolated CDKL5 kinase domain fully restored SV endocytosis kinetics. Finally, we demonstrated that CDKL5-mediated phosphorylation of amphiphysin 1, a putative presynaptic target, is not required for CDKL5-dependent control of SV endocytosis. Overall, our findings reveal a key presynaptic role for CDKL5 kinase activity and enhance our insight into how its dysfunction may culminate in CDD.<b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Loss of cyclin-dependent kinase like 5 (CDKL5) function is a leading cause of monogenic childhood epileptic encephalopathy. However, information regarding its biological role is scarce. In this study, we reveal a selective presynaptic role for CDKL5 in synaptic vesicle endocytosis and that its protein kinase activity is both necessary and sufficient for this role. The isolated protein kinase domain is sufficient to correct this loss of function, which may facilitate future gene therapy strategies if presynaptic dysfunction is proven to be central to the disorder. It also reveals that a CDKL5-specific substrate is located at the presynapse, the phosphorylation of which is required for optimal SV endocytosis.",

        "abstract": "Transgenes with genomic DNA fragments that encompass genes of interest are the gold standard for complementing null alleles in rescue experiments in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. Of particular interest are genomic DNA clones available as bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) or fosmids from publicly available genomic DNA libraries. Genes contained within BAC and fosmid clones can be easily modified by recombineering cloning to insert peptide or protein tags to localize, visualize, or manipulate gene products, and to create point mutations or deletions for structure-function analysis of the inserted genes. However, since transgenesis efficiency is inversely correlated with transgene size, obtaining transgenic animals for increasingly larger BAC and fosmid clones requires increasingly laborious screening efforts using the transgenesis marker commonly used for these transgenes, the dominant eye color marker white<sup>+</sup> . We recently described a drug-based selectable genetic platform for Drosophila melanogaster, which included four resistance markers that allow direct selection of transgenic animals, eliminating the need to identify transgenic progeny by laborious phenotypic screening. By integrating these resistance markers into BAC transgenes, we were able to isolate animals containing large transgenes by direct selection, avoiding laborious screening. Here we present procedures on how to upgrade BAC clones by serial recombineering cloning to build both selectable and tagged BAC transgenes, for selection transgenesis and functional gene analysis, respectively. We illustrate these procedures using a BAC clone encompassing the gene encoding the synaptic vesicle protein, cysteine string protein. We demonstrate that the modified BAC clone, serially recombineered with a selectable marker for selection transgenesis and an N-terminal green fluorescent protein tag for gene expression analysis, is functional by showing the expression pattern obtained after successful selection transgenesis. The protocols cover: (1) cloning and preparation of the recombineering templates needed for serial recombineering cloning to incorporate selectable markers and protein tags; (2) preparing electrocompetent cells needed to perform serial recombineering cloning; and (3) the serial recombineering workflow to generate both selectable and tagged genomic BAC reporter transgenes for selection transgenesis and functional gene analysis in Drosophila melanogaster. The protocols we describe can be easily adapted to incorporate any of four selectable markers, protein tags, or any other modification for structure-function analysis of the genes present within any of the BAC or fosmid clones.

        "abstract": "The cytoplasm is a complex, crowded, actively driven environment whose biophysical characteristics modulate critical cellular processes such as cytoskeletal dynamics, phase separation, and stem cell fate. Little is known about the variance in these cytoplasmic properties. Here, we employed particle-tracking nanorheology on genetically encoded multimeric 40 nm nanoparticles (GEMs) to measure diffusion within the cytoplasm of individual fission yeast (Schizosaccharomyces pombe) cellscells. We found that the apparent diffusion coefficients of individual GEM particles varied over a 400-fold range, while the differences in average particle diffusivity among individual cells spanned a 10-fold range. To determine the origin of this heterogeneity, we developed a Doppelgänger simulation approach that uses stochastic simulations of GEM diffusion that replicate the experimental statistics on a particle-by-particle basis, such that each experimental track and cell had a one-to-one correspondence with their simulated counterpart. These simulations showed that the large intra- and inter-cellular variations in diffusivity could not be explained by experimental variability but could only be reproduced with stochastic models that assume a wide intra- and inter-cellular variation in cytoplasmic viscosity. The simulation combining intra- and inter-cellular variation in viscosity also predicted weak nonergodicity in GEM diffusion, consistent with the experimental data. To probe the origin of this variation, we found that the variance in GEM diffusivity was largely independent of factors such as temperature, the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons, cell-cyle stage, and spatial locations, but was magnified by hyperosmotic shocks. Taken together, our results provide a striking demonstration that the cytoplasm is not \"well-mixed\" but represents a highly heterogeneous environment in which subcellular components at the 40 nm size scale experience dramatically different effective viscosities within an individual cell, as well as in different cells in a genetically identical population.

        "abstract": "Research has suggested that tumor-initiating tumor stem cells are derived from normal stem cells and that tumor cells undergo progressive de-differentiation to achieve a stem cell-like state. Tumor stem cells are characterized by high proliferation ability, high plasticity, expression of multi-drug resistance proteins, and the ability to seed new tumors. Octamer-binding transcription factor 4 (Oct-4) and its activation targets are overexpressed in the tumor stem cells of various types of tumors, and this expression is associated with the pathogenesis, development, and poor prognosis of tumors. The primary objective of this study was to test if a stably transfected with Oct-4 gene cell line, RL95-2/Oct-4, has the characteristics of tumor stem cells. Human endometrial carcinoma cells (RL95-2) were transfected with a plasmid carrying genes for Oct-4 and green fluorescent protein (GFP). The stably transfected cells, RL95-2/Oct-4, were selected using G418 and observed to express the GFP reporter gene under the control of the Oct-4 promoter. GFP expression levels of RL95-2/Oct-4 cells were measured using flow cytometry. The proliferation potential of cells was determined according to cumulative population doubling and colony-formation efficiency. Gene expression was analyzed using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. RL95-2/Oct-4 cells not only exhibited increased expression of the three most important stem cell genes, Oct-4, Nanog, and Sox2, but also had increased expression of the endometrial tumor stem cell genes CD133 and ALDH1. Furthermore, enhanced expression of these genes in the RL95-2/Oct-4 cells was associated with higher colony-forming ability and growth rate than in parental RL95-2 cells. We also observed that cisplatin induced less cell death in RL95-2/Oct-4 cells than in RL95-2 cells, indicating that RL95-2/Oct-4 cells were more resistant to chemotherapeutic agents. The study findings contribute to investigate the effects of Oct-4 on tumor stem cell origins.",

Here, we found that serotonin (5-HT) bi-directionally regulates the coincidence time window of olfactory learning in Drosophila and affects synaptic plasticity of Kenyon cells (KCs) in the mushroom body (MB). Utilizing GPCR-activation-based (GRAB) neurotransmitter sensors, we found that KC-released acetylcholine (ACh) activates a serotonergic dorsal paired medial (DPM) neuron, which in turn provides inhibitory feedback to KCs. Physiological stimuli induce spatially heterogeneous 5-HT signals, which proportionally gate the intrinsic coincidence time windows of different MB compartments. Artificially reducing or increasing the DPM neuron-released 5-HT shortens or prolongs the coincidence window, respectively. In a sequential trace conditioning paradigm, this serotonergic neuromodulation helps to bridge the CS-US temporal gap. Altogether, we report a model circuitry for perceiving the temporal coincidence and determining the causal relationship between environmental events.",

Mesoscale calcium imaging through a cranial window provides a method of studying the interaction of circuit activity between cortical areas but lacks access to subcortical regions. We have developed an optical and surgical preparation that preserves wide-field imaging of the cortical surface while also permitting access to specific subcortical networks. This was achieved using an optical fiber implanted in the striatum, along with a bilateral widefield cranial window, enabling simultaneous mesoscale cortical imaging and subcortical fiber photometry recording of calcium signals in a transgenic animal expressing GCaMP. Subcortical signals were collected from the dorsal regions of the striatum. We combined this approach with multiple sensory-motor tasks, including specific auditory and visual stimulation, and video monitoring of animal movements and pupillometry during head-fixed behaviors. We found high correlations between cortical and striatal activity in response to sensory stimulation or movement. Furthermore, spontaneous activity recordings revealed that specific motifs of cortical activity are correlated with presynaptic activity recorded in the striatum, enabling us to select for corticostriatal activity motifs. We believe that this method can be utilized to reveal not only global patterns but also cell-specific connectivity that provides insight into corticobasal ganglia circuit organization.",

Anhydrobiosis has been a biological enigma for more than a century with respect to how organisms sustain life without water, but the few choices of genetic toolkits available in tardigrade research have been a challenging circumstance. Here, we report the development of an in vivo expression system for tardigrades. This transient transgenic technique is based on a plasmid vector (TardiVec) with promoters that originated from an anhydrobiotic tardigrade <i>Ramazzottius varieornatus</i>. It enables the introduction of GFP-fused proteins and genetically encoded indicators such as the Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator GCaMP into tardigrade cells; consequently, the dynamics of proteins and cells in tardigrades may be observed by fluorescence live imaging. This system is applicable for several tardigrades in the class Eutardigrada: the promoters of anhydrobiosis-related genes showed tissue-specific expression in this work. Surprisingly, promoters functioned similarly between multiple species, even for species with different modes of expression of anhydrobiosis-related genes, such as <i>Hypsibius exemplaris,</i> in which these genes are highly induced upon facing desiccation, and <i>Thulinius ruffoi</i>, which lacks anhydrobiotic capability. These results suggest that the highly dynamic expression changes in desiccation-induced species are regulated in <i>trans</i>. Tissue-specific expression of tardigrade-unique unstructured proteins also suggests differing anhydrobiosis machinery depending on the cell types. We believe that tardigrade transgenic technology opens up various experimental possibilities in tardigrade research, especially to explore anhydrobiosis mechanisms.",

        "abstract": "Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most prevalent joint disorder with increasing worldwide incidence. Mechanistic insights into OA pathophysiology are evolving and there are currently no disease-modifying OA drugs. An increase in protease activity is linked to progressive degradation of the cartilage in OA. Proteases also trigger inflammation through a family of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) called the Proteinase-Activated Receptors (PARs). PAR signaling can trigger pro-inflammatory responses and targeting PARs is proposed as a therapeutic approach in OA. Several enzymes can cleave the PAR N-terminus, but the endogenous protease activators of PARs in OA remain unclear. Here we characterized PAR activating enzymes in knee joint synovial fluids from OA patients and healthy donors using genetically encoded PAR biosensor expressing cells. Calcium signaling assays were performed to examine receptor activation. The class and type of enzymes cleaving the PARs was further characterized using protease inhibitors and fluorogenic substrates. We find that PAR1, PAR2 and PAR4 activating enzymes are present in knee joint synovial fluids from healthy controls and OA patients. Compared to healthy controls, PAR1 activating enzymes are elevated in OA synovial fluids while PAR4 activating enzyme levels are decreased. Using enzyme class and type selective inhibitors and fluorogenic substrates we find that multiple PAR activating enzymes are present in OA joint fluids and identify serine proteinases (thrombin and trypsin-like) and matrix metalloproteinases as the major classes of PAR activating enzymes in the OA synovial fluids. Synovial fluid driven increase in calcium signaling was significantly reduced in cells treated with PAR1 and PAR2 antagonists, but not in PAR4 antagonist treated cells. OA associated elevation of PAR1 cleavage suggests that targeting this receptor may be beneficial in the treatment of OA.",

        "abstract": "A historically definitive marker for cholinergic neurons is choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), a synthesizing enzyme for acetylcholine, (ACh), which can be found in high concentrations in cholinergic neurons, both in the central and peripheral nervous systems. ChAT, is produced in the body of the neuron, transported to the nerve terminal (where its concentration is highest), and catalyzes the transfer of an acetyl group from the coenzyme acetyl-CoA to choline, yielding ACh. The creation of bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) transgenic mice that express promoter-specific fluorescent reporter proteins (green fluorescent protein-[GFP]) provided an enormous advantage for neuroscience. Both in vivo and in vitro experimental methods benefited from the transgenic visualization of cholinergic neurons. Mice were created by adding a BAC clone into the ChAT locus, in which enhanced GFP (eGFP) is inserted into exon 3 at the ChAT initiation codon, robustly and supposedly selectively expressing eGFP in all cholinergic neurons and fibers in the central and peripheral nervous systems as well as in non-neuronal cells. This project systematically compared the exact distribution of the ChAT-eGFP expressing neurons in the brain with the expression of ChAT by immunohistochemistry using mapping and also made comparisons with in situ hybridization (ISH). We qualitatively described the distribution of ChAT-eGFP neurons in the mouse brain by comparing it with the distribution of immunoreactive neurons and ISH data, paying special attention to areas where the expression did not overlap, such as the cortex, striatum, thalamus and hypothalamus. We found a complete overlap between the transgenic expression of eGFP and the immunohistochemical staining in the areas of the cholinergic basal forebrain. However, in the cortex and hippocampus, we found small neurons that were only labeled with the antibody and not expressed eGFP or vice versa. Most importantly, we found no transgenic expression of eGFP in the lateral dorsal, ventral and dorsomedial tegmental nuclei cholinergic cells. While the majority of the forebrain ChAT expression was aligned in the transgenic animals with immunohistochemistry, other areas of interest, such as the brainstem should be considered before choosing this particular transgenic mouse line.",

However, a causative role of neuronal oxidative stress in the development of aging-related cognitive decline and neurodegeneration remains elusive because of the lack of approaches for modeling isolated oxidative injury in the brain. Here, we present a chemogenetic approach based on the yeast flavoprotein d-amino acid oxidase (DAAO) for the generation of intraneuronal hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>). To validate this chemogenetic tool, DAAO and HyPer7, an ultrasensitive genetically encoded H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> biosensor, were targeted to neurons. Changes in the fluorescence of HyPer7 upon treatment of neurons expressing DAAO with d-norvaline (D-Nva), a DAAO substrate, confirmed chemogenetically induced production of intraneuornal H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Then, using the verified chemogenetic tool, we emulated isolated intraneuronal oxidative stress in acute brain slices and, using electrophysiological recordings, revealed that it does not alter basal synaptic transmission and the probability of neurotransmitter release from presynaptic terminals but reduces long-term potentiation (LTP). Moreover, treating neurons expressing DAAO with D-Nva via the patch pipette also decreases LTP. This observation indicates that isolated oxidative stress affects synaptic plasticity at single cell level. Our results broaden the toolset for studying normal redox regulation in the brain and elucidating the role of oxidative stress to the pathogenesis of cognitive aging and the early stages of aging-related neurodegenerative diseases. The proposed approach is useful for identification of early markers of neuronal oxidative stress and may be used in screens of potential antioxidants effective against neuronal oxidative injury.",

Measurements of metals' bioavailable concentrations and toxicities simultaneously and in-situ in environments can advance the understanding of their hazardous effects. The diffusive gradients in thin-films (DGT) is an in-situ technique can measure metal speciation and labile concentrations, but cannot yet provide the direct toxicity information. The whole-cell bioreporter Acinetobacter baylyi ADPWH_recA was successfully incorporated into the DGT device to develop a novel technique, Bio-DGT, for assessing the toxicity of metals at the same time of measuring their labile concentrations. The bioassay used in Bio-DGT can sense the mixture toxicity from multiple contaminants and the DGT can assist in identifying which toxicants may be causing the toxicity. Cadmium was used as the model metal to test the performance of Bio-DGT in waters and soils. The masses of Cd accumulated in Bio-DGT increased linearly and theoretically with time for 7 days deployment, indicating little influences from bioreporter cells on DGT performance. A positive relationship between bioluminescent signals towards Cd demonstrated the sensitive and active bioreporters' response. The sensitive of Bio-DGT, indicated by Cd concentrations causing the response, is 0.01 mg/L. The stable response from Bio-DGT under various conditions (pH 4-8, ionic strengths 0.01-0.5 M) and 30 days storage time suggest the applicability of the technique in real environments. The deployment of Bio-DGT in contaminated soils demonstrated that Cd toxicity was regulated by labile concentration, showing its potential application for the risk assessment of heavy metal contaminations, and its further feasibility in using Bio-DGT for measuring integration of multiple contaminants' effects and simultaneously determine the main toxicity driver(s).",

However, recent data indicate that VTA DAergic neurons are functionally heterogeneous with emerging roles in aversive signaling, salience, and novelty, based in part on anatomic location and projection, highlighting a need to functionally characterize the repertoire of VTA DAergic efferents in motivated behavior. Previous work identifying a mesointerpeduncular circuit consisting of VTA DAergic neurons projecting to the interpeduncular nucleus (IPN), a midbrain area implicated in aversion, anxiety-like behavior, and familiarity, has recently come into question. To verify the existence of this circuit, we combined presynaptic targeted and retrograde viral tracing in the dopamine transporter-Cre mouse line. Consistent with previous reports, synaptic tracing revealed that axon terminals from the VTA innervate the caudal IPN; whereas, retrograde tracing revealed DAergic VTA neurons, predominantly in the paranigral region, project to the nucleus accumbens shell, as well as the IPN. To test whether functional DAergic neurotransmission exists in the IPN, we expressed the genetically encoded DA sensor, dLight 1.2, in the IPN of C57BL/6J mice and measured IPN DA signals <i>in vivo</i> during social and anxiety-like behavior using fiber photometry. We observed an increase in IPN DA signal during social investigation of a novel but not familiar conspecific and during exploration of the anxiogenic open arms of the elevated plus maze. Together, these data confirm VTA DAergic neuron projections to the IPN and implicate this circuit in encoding motivated exploration.",

Terrestrially, a baseline understanding of the gene fitness response for any plant growth-promoting microbe when in a tripartite relationship with host and pathogen is currently unknown and is important to characterize before closed-environment spaceflight implementation. To that end, this study evaluated the behavior of an ISS plant habitat isolate of <i>Burkholderia contaminans</i> as tomato seeds transitioned to seedlings and assessed gene fitness during challenge with <i>Fusarium oxysporum</i> f. sp. <i>lycopersici</i> (FOL), the causal agent of Fusarium wilt. Using a seed film delivery method vetted for spaceflight, <i>B. contaminans</i> was applied to <i>Solanum lycopersicum</i> cv. Red Robin seeds. Green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged <i>B. contaminans</i> was primarily found to localize at the shoot-root junction and was detected on shoots. Upon FOL challenge, <i>B. contaminans</i> population levels remained stable, and despite harboring antifungal and plant growth-promoting capacity, these properties were not conferred in response to FOL in the tissue culture environment. To probe mechanisms underlying the bacterial-fungal interaction between <i>B. contaminans</i> and FOL in the tomato root zone, a genome-wide transposon mutant library was developed for the <i>B. contaminans</i> isolate. Transposon sequencing (Tn-Seq) analysis revealed that the type II secretion system (T2SS) was critical for root zone establishment, whereas a Nudix hydrolase was specifically important for responding to FOL infection and provided further confirmation that antifungal and siderophore-producing gene clusters were not.IMPORTANCEThis study is the first to evaluate the genetic fitness of a <i>Burkholderia contaminans</i> International Space Station (ISS) isolate in the plant root zone in association with the obligate pathogen <i>Fusarium oxysporum</i> f. sp. <i>lycopersici</i> (FOL).

Additionally, swine, which frequently interact with humans, may facilitate virus evolution, posing a risk to public health security. Consequently, there is a pressing need to develop safe, effective, and rapid vaccine platforms, with vector vaccine being a viable option. In this study, we utilized the enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) as an exogenous reporter to investigate the intergenic regions of the PIV5-JS17 strain for expressing exogenous proteins. These regions included N-P, P-M, M-F, F-SH, SH-HN, and HN-L. Our findings revealed that exogenous gene expression varied at different positions, with the expression cassette containing the non-coding sequence within the P-M intergenic region achieving the highest eGFP fluorescence intensity. Then, we successfully established a porcine infection model through oral administration of the recombinant virus, identified the target organs infected, and verified the safety of the viral vector in swine. Furthermore, using porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV)-S protein as a model antigen, it was demonstrated that the recombinant virus triggered a robust humoral and cellular immune responses. In conclusion, we have developed a novel oral gene delivery system for swine, providing insights and guidance for the design of vector vaccines based on the newly discovered porcine PIV5, the selection of appropriate exogenous gene insertion sites, and vaccine delivery strategies.IMPORTANCEThe research presented in this paper hinges on the fortunate isolation of the PIV5-JS17 strain from the intestines of pigs.

Using temporally specific photoconverting UV light exposures, we capture whole-brain \"snapshots\" of neural activity time-locked to stimuli during unrestrained larval behavior. We optimize experimental conditions for establishing sub-second neuronal activity changes across acoustically-evoked behavioral paradigms spanning minutes to hours. We then leverage this system to pinpoint brain-wide neural activity changes during nonassociative habituation learning, observing distinct activity signatures in the subpallium, preoptic area, and habenulae that are altered through pharmacological disruption of habituation learning.

        "abstract": "Approximately 90% of bladder cancer deaths are due to distant metastases rather than local tumor effects. The current first-line systemic treatment for metastatic bladder cancer (mBC) is chemoimmunotherapy or immunotherapy with pembrolizumab plus enfortumab vedotin (EV). However, most mBC patients treated with chemoimmunotherapy or pembrolizumab/EV do not respond or eventually relapse, highlighting the critical need for robust immunocompetent animal models to elucidate the mechanisms of primary and acquired resistance. We previously generated a syngeneic murine cell line CMV-TRP (triple knockout of Trp53, Rb1, Pten) via ex vivo transduction with adenovirus (Ad5CMVCre). To establish an mBC model, the TKO cells were effectively labeled with a lentiviral luciferase and GFP double-expressing reporter and injected into tail veins of C57 BL/6J mice. Tail vein injection of TKO cells reliably established distant metastases with lung and bone lesions. In immunotherapy experiments, mice injected with TKO-labeled cell lines were randomly treated with an anti-PD-1 or control IgG2a antibody. All mice developed lung and/or bone (hind limb or sacrum) metastases. There was no difference in tumor bioluminescence between the control group and anti-PD-1 group (median proton/second 6.94 × 10<sup>8</sup> vs. 4.32 × 10<sup>8</sup>, p = 0.85). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed no difference in median survival between the control group and anti-PD-1 group (19 days vs. 20 days, p = 0.47). Histology and immunohistochemical profile of lung and bone metastases revealed high-grade basal-like urothelial carcinoma, closely resembling the profile observed in subcutaneous tumor. No significant changes in immune cell infiltrations (CD4<sup>+</sup>, CD8<sup>+</sup>, or F4/80<sup>+</sup>) between groups may explain anti-PD-1 immunotherapy resistance. Therefore, the novel TKO metastatic model represents a useful and reproducible tool for studying tumor-cell dissemination, bone/lung metastasis, and the underlying mechanisms of anti-PD-1 immunotherapy resistance.",

Still, real-time visualization and quantification of this interaction remain technically challenging, especially across different host backgrounds. In this study, we systematically evaluate the efficacy of the nitrogenase system <i>nifH</i> promoter (P<i>nifH</i>) in driving expression of distinct fluorescent reporters; superfolder yellow fluorescent protein (sfYFP), superfolder cyan fluorescent protein (sfCFP), and various red fluorescent proteins (RFPs) within root nodules of determinate (<i>Lotus japonicus-Mesorhizobium japonicum</i>) and indeterminate (<i>Pisum sativum-Rhizobium leguminosarum</i>) systems. We show that P<i>nifH</i>-driven sfYFP and sfCFP yield strong, uniform, and reproducible fluorescence in nodules of both systems, facilitating reliable quantification of nodulation traits and strain occupancy. In contrast, RFPs including monomeric (mScarlet-I, mRFP1, mARs1) and multimeric (AzamiRed1.0) variants exhibited weak or inconsistent signals in pea. Notably, fluorescent labeling did not impair rhizobial competitiveness for root nodule occupancy, and P<i>nifH</i>-driven sfYFP and sfCFP reporters enabled robust multiplexed imaging in single-root and split-root assays. In the lotus, mScarlet-I worked robustly and facilitated a tripartite strain labeling system. Complementing our molecular toolkit, we established a deep learning-based analytical pipeline for high-throughput, automated quantification of nodulation traits, validated against standard ImageJ analysis. Altogether, our results identify P<i>nifH</i>-driven sfYFP and sfCFP as robust, broadly applicable reporters for legume-rhizobium symbiosis studies, while highlighting the need for optimized red fluorophores in some contexts. The integration of validated promoter-reporter constructs with state-of-the-art computational approaches provides a scalable framework for dissecting the spatial and competitive dynamics of plant-microbe mutualisms. The legume-rhizobium symbiosis is central to sustainable agriculture through its capacity for biological nitrogen fixation, yet tools for real-time, quantitative visualization of this interaction remain limited.

These reporters enable robust, reproducible fluorescence without impairing rhizobial competitiveness, supporting multiplexed imaging and quantitative nodulation analyses.

However, the components and regulations of SICS are unclear. Here, we explored SICS components and their regulation by the Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor calmodulin (CaM). Overexpression of the stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1), a key switcher of store-operated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry (SOCE), enhances SICS by fourfold. This effect is abolished by the truncation of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding loop within STIM1. Consistently, SOCE inhibition strongly suppresses SICS. Nutrient removal or stimulation of the transient receptor potential mucolipin-1 (TRPML1, encoded by the Mcoln1 gene) triggers intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> release that is prevented by pre-emptying of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca<sup>2+</sup>. In the presence of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, inhibition and silencing of Mcoln1 reduces SICS by 35-40%. We identified a CaM-binding site in the second cytoplasmic loop of TRPML1 that interacts with Ca<sup>2+</sup>-bound CaM. Mcoln1 overexpression enhances the upstroke and peak of SICS, effects that are absent with a mutated CaM-binding domain. Further, we generated a genetically encoded biosensor for TRPML1 (BS-ML1). BS-ML1 produces a robust signal upon nutrient deprivation, which is substantially reduced with the Mcoln1 mutant. The response of BS-ML1 to nutrient depletion is equally reduced by extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> removal or SOCE inhibition. Reduced CaM availability significantly prolongs SICS, consistent with an ~40% reduction in cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> removal rate. Our data thus indicate that (1) SICS comprises multiple components, including linked Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from the lysosome and ER and subsequent SOCE; and (2) CaM regulates the kinetics and magnitude of SICS by controlling cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> removal and a perilysosomal feedforward mechanism that promotes TRPML1 activity.

Here, we present QuickPhage, a rapid, technically accessible, precise, and cost-effective method for engineering <i><i>Bacillus subtilis</i></i> phages. Our approach uses CRISPR-Cas9 as a counter-selection system to isolate mutants of the model lytic siphovirus phage, SPP1. Efficient genome editing was achieved using homologous repair patches as short as 40 nucleotides, enabling streamlined patch construction and parallel engineering, resulting in highly accurate genome edits within a day. We applied QuickPhage to delete both essential and nonessential phage genes and to insert reporter genes. Protein production, such as GFP, was synthetically regulated using inducible systems without significantly affecting phage fitness, achieving induction levels of up to 400-fold. Time-series coinfection experiments with fluorescent protein expressing phages also revealed a highly efficient superinfection arrest mechanism that prevents reinfection as early as 13 min after initial infection. These findings highlight the potential of phages for protein production, opening new opportunities for metabolic engineering. This work also lays the foundation for systematic phage genome refactoring workflows and the development of phage-based tools for efficient DNA delivery, thereby expanding the synthetic biology toolbox for <i><i>B. subtilis</i>.</i>",

        "abstract": "Plants trigger specific changes in gene transcription to acclimate to low-oxygen concentrations. Plastid-localized STEAROYL-ACYL CARRIER PROTEIN ∆9-DESATURASE 6 (SAD6) converts C18:0- into C18:1-fatty acids and belongs to the core hypoxia-responsive genes. <i>SAD6</i> expression under hypoxia is activated by RAP2.12, which is a group-VII ethylene-response factor (ERF-VII) transcription factor regulated by sequestering to ACYL-CoA BINDING PROTEIN (ACBP) at the plasma membrane or proteasomal degradation via the PLANT CYSTEINE-OXIDASE N-degron pathway in response to molecular oxygen. Besides its role as hypoxia-specific marker gene, the biological function of SAD6 remains unclear. Here, we show that <i>SAD6</i> overexpression mostly phenocopies plants overexpressing an N-degron insensitive Δ13RAP2.12 protein, which fails to be targeted to proteasomal degradation, while silencing of <i>SAD6</i> in <i>Δ13RAP2.12</i>-overexpressor plants largely restores the wildtype phenotype, indicating SAD6 is crucial to shape the growth phenotype of plants with deregulated RAP2.12. However, silencing of <i>SAD6</i> also attenuated the expression of other important hypoxia-responsive genes, both, in <i>Δ13RAP2.12</i>-overexpressor and wildtype backgrounds in response to hypoxic treatment, indicating a signaling role of SAD6 in activating RAP2.12. By using green-fluorescent protein-reporter constructs we found that this is due to SAD6 promoting RAP2.12 relocation from the plasma membrane to the nucleus, most likely by its role to increase C18:1-acyl-CoA, which is bound by ACBP as ligand. These results indicate SAD6 to be crucial to trigger relocation of sequestered RAP2.12 protein to the nucleus, showing an involvement of plastid function in hypoxia signaling, which links plastid fatty-acid metabolism with plastid-to-nucleus retrograde signaling via ERF-VII factors to improve hypoxic-stress resistance.",

The origin of the cell lines was confirmed by examining the partial sequences of the cytochrome oxidase c subunit I (COI) gene of the flounder mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA).

        "abstract": "Plants rely on innate immune systems to defend against a wide variety of biotic attackers. Key components of innate immunity include cell-surface pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs), which recognize pest- and pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Unlike other classes of receptors that often have visible cell-death immune outputs upon activation, PRRs generally lack rapid methods for assessing function. Here, we describe a genetically encoded bioluminescent reporter of immune activation by heterologously expressed PRRs in the model organism <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>. We characterized <i>N. benthamiana</i> transcriptome changes in response to <i>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</i> and subsequent PAMP treatment to identify pattern-triggered immunity (PTI)-associated marker genes, which were then used to generate promoter-luciferase fusion fungal bioluminescence pathway (FBP) constructs. A reporter construct termed <i>pFBP_2xNbLYS1::LUZ</i> allows for robust detection of PTI activation by heterologously expressed PRRs. Consistent with known PTI signaling pathways, reporter activation by receptor-like protein (RLP) PRRs is dependent on the known adaptor of RLP PRRs, i.e., SOBIR1. The FBP reporter minimizes the amount of labor, reagents, and time needed to assay function of PRRs and displays robust sensitivity at biologically relevant PAMP concentrations, making it ideal for high throughput screens. The tools described in this paper will be powerful for investigations of PRR function and characterization of the structure-function of plant cell-surface receptors.

Although nucleus-absent cells display highly tunable frequency, the nucleus-present cells maintain constant frequency against cyclin B1 variations. Despite high expression variability, cyclin degraded within the same duration, enabling a robust mitotic phase. Moreover, Cdk1 and cyclin B1 cycle rigorously out-of-phase, ensuring wide phase-plane orbits, essential for oscillation robustness. Although Cdk1 in homogeneous extracts is well known for delayed switch-like activation, we find active cyclin B1-Cdk1 accumulates in nuclei, without delay, until the nuclear envelope breakdown (NEB) when another abrupt activation triggers anaphase.

        "abstract": "Pro-oxidative shift in redox balance, usually termed as \"oxidative stress\", can lead to different cell responses depending on its intensity. Excessive accumulation of reactive oxygen species (\"oxidative distress\") can cause DNA, lipid and protein damage. Physiological oxidative stimulus (\"oxidative eustress\"), in turn, can favor cell proliferation and differentiation - the processes of paramount importance primarily for stem cells. Functions of antioxidant enzymes in cells is currently a focus of intense research, however the role of different antioxidant pathways in pluripotent cell responses to oxidative distress/eustress is still under investigation. In this study, we assessed the contribution of the thioredoxin reductase (TrxR)-dependent pathways to maintaining the redox homeostasis in human induced pluripotent stem cells and their differentiated progeny cells under basal conditions and under conditions of oxidative stress of varying intensity. Employing the genetically encoded H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> biosensor cyto-HyPer and two inhibitors of thioredoxin reductase (auranofin and Tri-1), we show that the reduced activity of TrxR-dependent enzymatic systems leads to the non-cytotoxic disruption of thiol-disulfide metabolism in the cytoplasm of both pluripotent and differentiated cells under basal conditions. Quantifying the cytoplasmic concentrations of peroxide establishing in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-stressed cells, we demonstrate that TrxR-dependent pathways contribute to the antioxidant activity in the cell cytoplasm under conditions of mild but not severe oxidative stress in both cell lines tested. The observed effects may testify about a conservative role of the TrxR-controlled enzymatic systems manifested as a response to physiological redox stimuli rather than a protection against the severe oxidative stress.",

These enzymes are prone to resistance mutations, yet their promise for treating viral diseases and other disorders continues to grow. This study develops a general approach for detecting microbially synthesized protease inhibitors and uses it to screen terpenoid pathways for inhibitory compounds. The detection scheme relies on a bacterial two-hybrid (B2H) system that links protease inactivation to the transcription of a swappable reporter gene. This system, which can accomodate multiple biochemical outputs (i.e., luminescence and antibiotic resistance), permitted the facile incorporation of four disease-relevant proteases. A B2H designed to detect the inactivation of the main protease of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 enabled the identification of a terpenoid inhibitor of modest potency. An analysis of multiple pathways that make this terpenoid, however, suggested that its production was necessary but not sufficient to confer a survival advantage in growth-coupled assays. This finding highlights an important challenge associated with the use of genetic selection to search for inhibitors─notably, the influence of pathway toxicity─and underlines the value of including multiple pathways with overlapping product profiles in pathway screens. This study provides a detailed experimental framework for using microbes to screen libraries of biosynthetic pathways for targeted protease inhibitors.",

Tamoxifen (TAM)-inducible Cre recombinase is widely used for tissue-specific and temporal induction of gene deletion in mice. However, the tamoxifen treatment regimen for the generation of whole-body deletion of a gene is not yet fully standardized for the majority of organs/tissues. Accordingly, we employed GtROSA26 (R26) promoter-regulated Cre and a reporter gene expression strategy. GtROSA26 (R26) is an ubiquitous promoter and mice carrying the R26<sup>Cre-ERT2</sup> transgene express Cre-ERT2 in all the cells. Similarly, mice carrying the R26<sup>mTOM-mEGFP</sup> transgene express mTOM (membrane-targeted tdTomato), in the absence of Cre or mEGFP (membrane-targeted enhanced green fluorescent protein), in the presence of Cre, in all the cells. The progeny carrying one allele of both transgenes were subjected to different TAM regimens, i.e., IP injections (4 injections; 1.35 mg/injection), diet (400 mg TAM-citrate/kg food), or diet (400 mg TAM-citrate/kg food) combined with either TAM-oral gavage (4 gavages; 1.35 mg/gavage) or TAM IP injections (4 injections; 1.35 mg/injection) for 2-weeks beginning at postnatal day (PND) 21 and the extent of Cre recombination in different tissues was determined at PND35. Tamoxifen administration resulted in a transient loss of body weight in all the treatment regimens with a relatively slower rate of weight gain in the TAM-diet plus TAM-oral gavage group compared to other groups. While the efficiency of Cre recombination, as determined by the expression of mEGFP protein, was variable among tissues, major tissues such as the liver, heart, lungs, spleen, and thymus-showed almost complete recombination. No recombination was evident in any of the tissues examined from the control mice. In general, the efficiency of Cre recombination was better with a combined regimen of TAM-diet with either TAM-injections or TAM-oral gavage compared to TAM-diet alone or TAM-injections alone. Our results demonstrate that a combination of TAM-diet with either TAM-injections or TAM-oral gavage can be employed for the efficient deletion of a gene in the whole body. Our findings will provide technical expertise to the researchers employing TAM-inducible Cre for the deletion of floxed genes in varied tissues.",

Organic amino nitrogen and ammonium were determined by a portable luminometer and luminol supported in a measurement tube.

        "abstract": "Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is one of the most utilized serological methods to diagnose and identify etiologic agents of many infectious diseases and other physiologically important analytes. ELISA can be used either alone or adjunct to other diagnostic methods such as molecular arrays, and other serological techniques. Most ELISA assays utilize reagents that are proteinaceous in nature, which are not very stable and require cold-chain transport systems. Development of a desirable immunoassay requires stability of reagents used and its ability to be stored at room temperature without sacrificing the activity of the reagents or the protein of interest. Metal organic frameworks (MOFs) are a rapidly emerging and evolving class of porous polymeric materials used in a variety of biosensor applications. In this study, we introduce the use of MOFs to stabilize a universal reporter fusion protein, specifically, avidin-like protein (Tam-avidin2) and the small bioluminescent protein Gaussia luciferase (Gluc) forming the fusion reporter, tamavidin2-Gluc (TA2-Gluc). This fusion protein serves as a universal reporter for any assays that utilize biotin-avidin binding strategy. Using SARS-CoV2 S1 spike antigen as the model target antigen, we demonstrated that encapsulation of TA2-Gluc fusion protein using a nano-porous material, zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8), allows us to store and preserve this reporter protein at room temperature for over 6 months and use it as a reporter for an ELISA assay. Our optimized assay was validated demonstrating a 0.26 μg mL<sup>-1</sup> limit of detection, high reproducibility of assay over days, detection of spiked non-virulent SARS-COV2 pseudovirus in real sample matrix, and detection in real COVID-19 infected individuals. This result can lead to the utilization of our TA2-Gluc fusion protein reporter with other assays and potentially in diagnostic technologies in a point-of-care setting.",

Recent studies have shown that the bromination of compounds associated with the marine Coelenterazine system can provide them with new properties, such as anticancer activity and enhanced emission. Given this, our objective is to characterize the photophysical properties of a previously reported brominated Coelenteramide analog, by employing a combined experimental and theoretical approach. To better analyze the potential halogen effect, we have also synthesized and characterized, for the first time, two new fluorinated and chlorinated Coelenteramide analogs. These compounds show similar emission spectra in aqueous solution, but with different fluorescence quantum yields, in a trend that can be correlated with the heavy-atom effect (F > Cl > Br). A blue shift in emission in other solvents is also verified with the F−Cl−Br trend. More relevantly, the fluorescence quantum yield of the brominated analog is particularly sensitive to changes in solvent, which indicates that this compound has potential use as a microenvironment fluorescence probe. Theoretical calculations indicate that the observed excited state transitions result from local excitations involving the pyrazine ring.

The microswitch consists of a flexible soft beam electrode and a fixed electrode, forming a soft microsystem. By tuning the cohesion force of the liquid metal between the electrodes, the microswitch can convert its states between an individual and a self-locking state. The microswitch can achieve a reasonable rapid response (~12 ms) and high switching frequency (~95 Hz).

In this study, the in vitro and in vivo efficacy of two modified bioluminescent substrates, CycLuc1 and AkaLumine-HCl, were compared with that of D-luciferin as a gold standard. Comparisons were made in experimental and insect-transmitted animal models of leishmaniasis (caused by intracellular <i>Leishmania</i> species) and African trypanosomiasis (caused by extracellular <i>Trypanosoma</i> species), using parasite strains expressing the red-shifted firefly luciferase PpyRE9. Although the luminogenic properties of AkaLumine-HCl and D-luciferin for in vitro parasite detection were comparable at equal substrate concentrations, AkaLumine-HCl proved to be unsuitable for in vivo infection follow-up due to high background signals in the liver. CycLuc1 presented a higher in vitro luminescence compared to the other substrates and proved to be highly efficacious in vivo, even at a 20-fold lower dose than D-luciferin. This efficacy was consistent across infections with the herein included intracellular and extracellular parasitic organisms. It can be concluded that CycLuc1 is an excellent and broadly applicable alternative for D-luciferin, requiring significantly lower doses for in vivo bioluminescent imaging in rodent models of leishmaniasis and African trypanosomiasis.",

To efficiently sample this space, we present and validate a stepwise bioinformatics strategy focused first on the chloride binding pocket and second on a monomeric oligomerization state. Using this, we identified GFPxm163 from GFPxm found in the jellyfish <i>Aequorea macrodactyla</i>. <i>In vitro</i> characterization shows that the binding of chloride as well as bromide, iodide, and nitrate rapidly tunes the ground state chromophore equilibrium from the phenolate to the phenol state generating a pH-dependent, turn-off fluorescence response. Furthermore, live-cell fluorescence microscopy reveals that GFPxm163 provides a reversible, yet indirect readout of chloride transport <i>via</i> iodide exchange.

Here, our objective was to develop an imaging reporter system that offers sensitive three-dimensional (3D) detection of cancer cells at high resolutions in live mice. An organic anion-transporting polypeptide 1b3 (oatp1b3) was used as an MRI reporter gene, and its sensitivity was systematically optimized for in vivo tracking of viable cancer cells in a spontaneous metastasis model. Metastases with oatp1b3-MRI could be observed at the single lymph node level and tracked over time as cancer cells spread to multiple lymph nodes and different organ systems in individual animals. While initial single lesions were successfully imaged in parallel via bioluminescence, later metastases were largely obscured by light scatter from the initial node. Importantly, MRI could detect micrometastases in lung tissue comprised on the order of 1,000 cancer cells. In summary, oatp1b3-MRI enables longitudinal tracking of cancer cells with combined high resolution and high sensitivity that provides 3D spatial information and the surrounding anatomical context.

We demonstrate the modularity of CLAPon by designing a series of reporters for detecting protease activity and protein-protein interactions (PPIs). CLAPon for protease activity showed a 390-fold fluorescent signal increase upon tobacco etch virus protease cleavage. CLAPon for PPI detection (PPI-CLAPon) has two variants, PPI-CLAPon1.0 and 1.1. PPI-CLAPon1.0 showed a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of up to 107 for high-affinity PPI pairs and enabled imaging with sub-cellular spatial resolution. However, the more sensitive PPI-CLAPon1.1 is required for detecting low-affinity PPI pairs. PPI-CLAPon1.0 was further engineered to a reporter with light-dependent temporal gating, called LiPPI-CLAPon1.0, which can detect a 3-min calcium-dependent PPI with an SNR of 17. LiPPI-CLAPon enables PPI detection within a specific time window with rapid APEX activation and diverse readout. Lastly, PPI-CLAPon1.0 was designed to have chemical gating, providing more versatility to complement the LiPPI-CLAPon.

These GECIs are small proteins containing the N- and C-termini of GFP; they exert a limited effect on the cellular free calcium ion concentration; and in contrast to calmodulin-based calcium indicators they lack undesired interactions with intracellular proteins in neurons. The available TnC-based NTnC or YTnC GECIs had either an inverted response and high brightness but a limited dynamic range or a positive response and fast kinetics in neurons but lower brightness and an enhanced but still limited dF/F dynamic range. Here, we solved the crystal structure of NTnC at 2.5 Å resolution. Based on this structure, we developed positive NTnC2 and inverted iNTnC2 GECIs with a large dF/F dynamic range in vitro but very slow rise and decay kinetics in neurons. To overcome their slow responsiveness, we swapped TnC from <i>O. tau</i> in NTnC2 with truncated troponin C proteins from the muscles of fast animals, namely, the falcon, hummingbird, cheetah, bat, rattlesnake, and ant, and then optimized the resulting constructs using directed molecular evolution. Characterization of the engineered variants using purified proteins, mammalian cells, and neuronal cultures revealed cNTnC GECI with truncated TnC from <i>Calypte anna</i> (hummingbird) to have the largest dF/F fluorescence response and fast dissociation kinetics in neuronal cultures. In addition, based on the insertion of truncated TnCs from fast animals into YTnC2, we developed fYTnC2 GECI with TnC from <i>Falco peregrinus</i> (falcon). The purified proteins cNTnC and fYTnC2 had 8- and 6-fold higher molecular brightness and 7- and 6-fold larger dF/F responses to the increase in Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion concentration than YTnC, respectively. cNTnC GECI was also 4-fold more photostable than YTnC and fYTnC2 GECIs. Finally, we assessed the developed GECIs in primary mouse neuronal cultures stimulated with an external electric field; in these conditions, cNTnC had a 2.4-fold higher dF/F fluorescence response than YTnC and fYTnC2 and was the same or slightly slower (1.4-fold) than fYTnC2 and YTnC in the rise and decay half-times, respectively.",

        "abstract": "Precise photochemical control, using two-photon excitation (2PE), of the timing and location of activation of glutamate is useful for studying the molecular and cellular physiology of the brain. Antenna-based light harvesting strategies represent a general method to increase the sensitivity to 2PE of otherwise insensitive photoremovable protecting groups (PPGs). This was applied to the most commonly used form of \"caged\" glutamate, MNI-Glu. Computational investigation showed that a four- or six-carbon linker attached between the 4-position of thioxanthone (THX) and the 4-position of the 5-methyl derivative of MNI-Glu (MMNI-Glu) would position the antenna and PPG close to one another to enable Dexter energy transfer. Nine THX-MMNI-Glu conjugates were prepared and their photochemical properties determined. Installation of the THX antenna resulted in a red shift of the absorption (λ<sub>max</sub> = 385-405 nm) along with increased quantum yield compared to the parent compound MNI-Glu (λ<sub>max</sub> = 347 nm). The THX-MMNI-Glu conjugate with a four-carbon linker and attachment to the 4-position of THX underwent photolysis via 1PE at 405 and 430 nm and via 2PE at 770 and 860 nm, yielding glutamate. The two-photon uncaging action cross section (δ<sub>u</sub>) was 0.11 and 0.29 GM at 770 and 860, respectively, which was greater than for MNI-Glu (0.06 and 0.072 GM at 720 and 770 nm, respectively). The THX sensitizer harvested the light via 2PE and transferred its resulting triplet energy to MMNI-Glu. Release of glutamate through 2PE at 860 nm from the compound (100 μM) activated iGluSnFR, a genetically encoded, fluorescent glutamate sensor, on the surface of cells in culture, portending its usefulness in studies of neurophysiology in acute brain slice.",

Lack of p16 gene expression can lead to infinite cell proliferation and malignant transformation. To determine whether the hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx) regulates the methylation and expression of the p16 gene. We constructed a eukaryotic expression vector carrying the HBx gene and green fluorescent protein (GFP), and transfected it into HepG2 cells to build cell lines stably expressing GFP and GFP-HBx. The p16 protein level and p16 gene methylation were measured in these cell lines. We further detected the mRNA expression of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) 1, 3A and 3B. The DNMT1, DNMT3A and DNMT3B gene promoter sequences were inserted into a reporter vector (pGL3-Basic) to build recombinant vectors, which were then transiently transfected into different cell lines. After 48 h, the luciferase activity was measured. The level of p16 protein in GFP-HBx/HepG2 cells was significantly lower than in HepG2 and GFP/HepG2 cells. The CpG methylation was present in the p16 gene promoter region of GFP-HBx/HepG2 cells. The DNMT1 and DNMT3A mRNA levels in GFP-HBx/HepG2 cells were significantly elevated compared to that in the HepG2 cells (p = 0.0495). The luciferase activity in GFP-HBx/HepG2 cells transfected with the pGL3-DNMT1/3A pro plasmid was significantly higher than in HepG2 and GFP/HepG2 cells (both p < 0.05). The HBx can induce p16 gene promoter methylation and inhibit the expression of p16 in HepG2 cells. This occurs due to HBx activation of DNMT1 and DNMT3A promoters and the induction of p16 promoter methylation, which downregulates the expression of p16 protein.",

Considering this, we constructed pEH2B and pMH2B vectors by fusing <i>M. importuna</i> endogenous histone protein H2B with fluorescent proteins eGFP or mCherry, respectively. Based on the constructed pEH2B and pMH2B vectors, nuclear fluorescence localization was performed via <i>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</i>-mediated transformation (ATMT). These two vectors were both driven by two endogenous promoters <i>glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPD)</i> and <i>ubiquitin (UBI)</i>. The vector-based reporter systems were tested by the paired culture of two genetically modified strains pEH2B-labeled M04M24 (24e, MAT1-1-1) and pMH2B-abeled M04M26 (26m, MAT1-2-1). The fluorescence observation and molecular identification results indicated the successful hyphal fusion and heterokaryon formation. We found that the expression of the reporter genes was stable, and it did not interfere with the growth of the fungus. Our constructed nucleus-directed fluorescent systems in <i>M. importuna</i> can be used for monitoring the dynamic development and reproductive processes in living cells and also for monitoring the interaction between morels and plant roots.

The dye-fluorescent protein conjugate is robust for a wide selection of combinations, facilitating rearrangement for coordinating emission profile of molecular sensors to adjust for visualization conditions, target phenomena, and simultaneous use.

We found cumulative caspase-9 activity rather than reaction rate inversely regulated caspase-3 execution times for apoptotic cell death.

Some of them (for example, indicators of calcium cations and hydrogen peroxide) are successfully used by numerous groups of researchers in experiments in vivo. The fundamental limitation of most fluorescent indicators is their ability to only qualitatively assess the change in the parameter of interest in the cell. The nature of this limitation is that it is difficult to compare the absolute value of the measured parameter and the detected fluorescent signal for various reasons. Quantitative measurements impose an additional requirement on the indicator signal: it should not depend on the technical features of the experiment (such as the level of protein expression, the type and power of the excitation source, a set of fluorescent filters, etc.). The fulfillment of this requirement may be associated with the detection of the indicator signal in the time domain, where the main characteristic of the signal is the fluorescence lifetime. The fluorescence lifetime is an absolute value, insensitive to changes in the intensity of the excitation source, detection settings, losses in the optical path or sample, changes in the concentration of the fluorophore in the sample, photobleaching. Thus, when calibrating an indicator in the time domain, a specific value of the measured parameter is associated with a specific value of the fluorescence lifetime. The time-resolved imaging mode imposes its own limitations on the properties of the indicator's fluorescent core. Thus, the lifetime of its fluorescence should change in proportion to the value of the measured parameter, which is not characteristic of any fluorophore. In this work, we make a brief review of the principles of detection of the fluorescent signal of genetically encoded indicators, focusing on current approaches related to the analysis of time-resolved data.",

Sensor proteins based on intramolecular complementation of split NanoLuc are particularly attractive because their intrinsic modular design enables for systematic tuning of sensor properties. Here we show how the sensitivity of these sensors can be enhanced by the introduction of catalytically inactive variants of the small SmBiT subunit (DarkBiTs) as intramolecular inhibitors. Starting from previously developed bioluminescent antibody sensor proteins (LUMABS), we developed single component, biomolecular switches with a strongly reduced background signal for the detection of three clinically relevant antibodies, anti-HIV1-p17, cetuximab (CTX), and an RSV neutralizing antibody (101F). These new dark-LUMABS sensors showed 5-13-fold increases in sensitivity which translated into lower limits of detection. The use of DarkBiTs as competitive intramolecular inhibitor domains is not limited to the LUMABS sensor family and might be used to boost the performance of other bioluminescent sensor proteins based on split luciferase complementation.",

Strikingly, we showed that gravity triggers asymmetric PA distribution at the root apex, a response that is suppressed by PLDζ2 knockout.

Recently, increasing evidence has revealed that cellular bioelectric signaling is critical for regulating embryonic development, regeneration, and congenital diseases. However, systematic real-time <i>in vivo</i> dynamic electrical activity monitoring of whole organisms has been limited, mainly due to the lack of a suitable model system and voltage measurement tools for <i>in vivo</i> biology. Here, we addressed this gap by utilizing a genetically stable zebrafish line, Tg (<i>ubiquitin</i>: ASAP1), and ASAP1 (Accelerated sensor of action potentials 1), a genetically encoded voltage indicator (GEVI). With light-sheet microscopy, we systematically investigated cell membrane potential (Vm) signals during different embryonic stages. We found cells of zebrafish embryos showed local membrane hyperpolarization at the cleavage furrows during the cleavage period of embryogenesis. This signal appeared before cytokinesis and fluctuated as it progressed. In contrast, whole-cell transient hyperpolarization was observed during the blastula and gastrula stages. These signals were generally limited to the superficial blastomere, but they could be detected within the deeper cells during the gastrulation period. Moreover, the zebrafish embryos exhibit tissue-level cell Vm signals during the segmentation period. Middle-aged somites had strong and dynamic Vm fluctuations starting at about the 12-somite stage. These embryonic stage-specific characteristic cellular bioelectric signals suggest that they might play a diverse role in zebrafish embryogenesis that could underlie human congenital diseases.",

The main principle of DGE is clear. However, what remains to be established is to which extent the signal reflects vascular, extracellular or intracellular glucose. To elucidate the compartmental contributions to the DGE signal, we coupled it with FRET-based fiber photometry of genetically encoded sensors, a technique that combines quantitative glucose readout with cellular specificity. The glucose sensor FLIIP was used with fiber photometry to measure astrocytic and neuronal glucose changes upon injection of D-glucose, 3OMG and L-glucose, in the anaesthetized murine brain. By correlating the kinetic profiles of the techniques, we demonstrate the presence of a vascular contribution to the signal, especially at early time points after injection.

Unfortunately, this variant was also slower. The weighted tau on of the variant (25 ms) was more than double the original construct (11 ms). The weighted tau off was >20 ms compared with 10 ms for the original GEVI. The voltage range of the GEVI was also shifted to more negative potentials. Insertion of spacer amino acids between the fluorescent-protein domain and the endoplasmic reticulum release motif at the C-terminus rescued the speed of both the tau on and tau off while restoring the voltage range and maintaining the improved voltage-dependent optical signal.

The prevention of further antimicrobial resistance development is unlikely due to the continued misuse of antibiotics, augmented by the lack of discovery of novel antibiotics. Screening large libraries of synthetic compounds have yet to offer effective replacements for current antibiotics. Due to historical successes, discovery from large and diverse natural sources and, more specifically, environmental bacteria, may still yield novel alternative antibiotics. However, the process of antibiotic discovery from natural sources is laborious and time-consuming as a result of outdated methodologies. Therefore, we have developed a simple and rapid preliminary screening assay to identify antibacterial-producing bacteria from natural sources. In brief, the assay utilizes the presence or absence of luminescence in bioluminescent reporter bacteria and test bacterium co-cultures in a 96-well plate format to determine the absence or presence of antibacterial compound production. Our assay, called the bioluminescent simultaneous antagonism (BSLA) assay, can accurately distinguish between known antibacterial-producing and non-producing test bacteria. The BSLA assay was validated by screening 264 unknown soil isolates which resulted in the identification of 10 antibacterial-producing isolates, effectively decreasing the pool of isolates for downstream analysis by 96%. By design, the assay is simple and requires only general laboratory equipment; however, we have shown that the assay can be scaled to automated high-throughput screening systems. Taken together, the BSLA assay allows for the rapid pre-screening of unknown bacterial isolates which, when coupled with innovative downstream dereplication and identification technologies, can effectively fast-track antimicrobial discovery.",

The effect of nitric oxide on the fluorescence properties of FPs has not been investigated thus far, despite the tremendous role FPs have played for 25 years as tools in cell biology. We have examined the response to nitric oxide of fluorescence emission by the blue-emitting fluorescent protein mTagBFP2. To our surprise, upon exposure to micromolar concentrations of nitric oxide, we observed a roughly 30% reduction in fluorescence quantum yield and lifetime. Recovery of fluorescence emission is observed after treatment with Na-dithionite. Experiments on related fluorescent proteins from different families show similar nitric oxide sensitivity of their fluorescence. We correlate the effect with S-nitrosylation of Cys residues. Mutation of Cys residues in mTagBFP2 removes its nitric oxide sensitivity. Similarly, fluorescent proteins devoid of Cys residues are insensitive to nitric oxide.

These are further reduced in amplitude by hypoosmotic shock and often appear as Ca<sup>2+</sup> waves (Lukyanenko et al., J. Physiol., 2017). Ca<sup>2+</sup> waves are typically associated with Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> release, or CICR, which can be myopathic. We tested the ability of a permeable Ca<sup>2+</sup> chelator, BAPTA-AM, to inhibit CICR in injured dysferlin-null fibers and found that 10-50 nM BAPTA-AM suppressed all Ca<sup>2+</sup> waves. The same concentrations of BAPTA-AM increased the amplitude of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient in A/J fibers to wild type levels and protected transients against the loss of amplitude after hypoosmotic shock, as also seen in wild type fibers. Incubation with 10 nM BAPTA-AM led to intracellular BAPTA concentrations of ∼60 nM, as estimated with its fluorescent analog, Fluo-4AM. This should be sufficient to restore intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> to levels seen in wild type muscle. Fluo-4AM was ∼10-fold less effective than BAPTA-AM, however, consistent with its lower affinity for Ca<sup>2+</sup>. EGTA, which has an affinity for Ca<sup>2+</sup> similar to BAPTA, but with much slower kinetics of binding, was even less potent when introduced as the -AM derivative.

Autoprocessing is self-catalyzed by SHhC, the SHh precursor's C-terminal enzymatic domain. A method to screen for small molecule regulators of this process may be of therapeutic value. Here, we describe the development and validation of the first cellular reporter to monitor human SHhC autoprocessing noninvasively in high-throughput compatible plates. The assay couples intracellular SHhC autoprocessing using endogenous cholesterol to the extracellular secretion of the bioluminescent nanoluciferase enzyme. We developed a WT SHhC reporter line for evaluating potential autoprocessing inhibitors by concentration response-dependent suppression of extracellular bioluminescence. Additionally, a conditional mutant SHhC (D46A) reporter line was developed for identifying potential autoprocessing activators by a concentration response-dependent gain of extracellular bioluminescence. The D46A mutation removes a conserved general base that is critical for the activation of the cholesterol substrate. Inducibility of the D46A reporter was established using a synthetic sterol, 2-α carboxy cholestanol, designed to bypass the defect through intramolecular general base catalysis. To facilitate direct nanoluciferase detection in the cell culture media of 1536-well plates, we designed a novel anionic phosphonylated coelenterazine, CLZ-2P, as the nanoluciferase substrate.

Viral replication occurs within virus-induced vesicular invaginations in the ER membrane. A hallmark of flavivirus infection is expansion of the ER membrane which can be observed at specific time points post infection. However, this process has not been effectively visualized in living cells throughout the course of infection at the single cell resolution. In this study, we developed a plasmid-based reporter system to monitor flavivirus infection and simultaneous virus-induced manipulation of single cells throughout the course of infection in real-time. This system requires viral protease cleavage to release an ER-anchored fluorescent protein infection reporter that is fused to a nuclear localization signal (NLS). This proteolytic cleavage allows for the translocation of the infection reporter signal to the nucleus while an ER-specific fluorescent marker remains localized in the lumen. Thus, the construct allows for the visualization of virus-dependent changes to the ER throughout the course of infection. In this study, we show that our reporter was efficiently cleaved upon the expression of multiple flavivirus proteases, including dengue virus (DENV), Zika virus (ZIKV), and yellow fever virus (YFV). We also found that the DENV protease-dependent cleavage of our ER-anchored reporter exhibited more stringent cleavage sequence specificity than what has previously been shown with biochemical assays. Using this system for long term time-lapse imaging of living cells infected with DENV, we observed nuclear translocation of the reporter signal beginning approximately 8 hours post-infection, which continued to increase throughout the time course. Interestingly, we found that increased reporter signal translocation correlated with increased ER signal intensity, suggesting a positive association between DENV infection and ER expansion in a time-dependent manner. Overall, this report demonstrates that the FlavER platform provides a useful tool for monitoring flavivirus infection and simultaneously observing virus-dependent changes to the host cell ER, allowing for study of the temporal nature of virus-host interactions.",

Herein, we demonstrate the use of a homogeneous, bioluminescent-based, split reporter platform that enables a simple, sensitive, and rapid method for analyte detection in clinical samples. We developed this point-of-care application using an optimized ternary, split-NanoLuc luciferase reporter system that consists of two small reporter peptides added as appendages to analyte-specific affinity reagents. A bright, stable bioluminescent signal is generated as the affinity reagents bind to the analyte, allowing for proximity-induced complementation between the two reporter peptides and the polypeptide protein, in addition to the furimazine substrate. Through lyophilization of the stabilized reporter system with the formulated substrate, we demonstrate a shelf-stable, all-in-one, add-and-read analyte-detection system for use in complex sample matrices at the point-of-care. We highlight the modularity of this platform using two distinct SARS-CoV-2 model systems: SARS-CoV-2 N-antigen detection for active infections and anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies for immunity status detection using chemically conjugated or genetically fused affinity reagents, respectively.

An adenoviral vector-based vaccine has been proposed as a conservation strategy for the Tasmanian devil. This study aimed to determine if a human adenovirus serotype 5 could express functional transgenes in devil cells. As DFT1 cells do not constitutively express major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I), we developed a replication-deficient adenoviral vector that encodes devil interferon gamma (IFN-γ) fused to a fluorescent protein reporter. Our results show that adenoviral-expressed IFN-γ was able to stimulate upregulation of beta-2 microglobulin, a component of MHC-I, on DFT1, DFT2 and devil fibroblast cell lines.

        "abstract": "The endocannabinoid system (ECS) modulates synaptic function to regulate many aspects of neurophysiology. It adapts to environmental changes and is affected by disease. Thus, the ECS presents an important target for therapeutic development. Despite recent interest in cannabinoid-based treatments, few preclinical studies are conducted in human systems. Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) provide one possible solution to this issue. However, it is not known if these cells have a fully functional ECS. Here, we show that hiPSC-derived neuron/astrocyte cultures exhibit a complete ECS. Using Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging and a genetically encoded endocannabinoid sensor, we demonstrate that they not only respond to exogenously applied cannabinoids but also produce and metabolize endocannabinoids. Synaptically driven [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> spiking activity was inhibited (EC<sub>50</sub> = 48 ± 13 nM) by the efficacious agonist [R(+)-[2,3-dihydro-5-methyl-3-[(morpholinyl)methyl]pyrolol [1,2,3-de]-1,4-benzoxazin-yl]-(1-naphthalenyl)methanone mesylate] (Win 55,212-2) and by the endogenous ligand 2-arachidonoyl glycerol (2-AG; EC<sub>50</sub> = 2.0 ± 0.6 µm). The effects of Win 55212-2 were blocked by a CB<sub>1</sub> receptor-selective antagonist. Δ<sup>9</sup>-Tetrahydrocannabinol acted as a partial agonist, maximally inhibiting synaptic activity by 47 ± 14% (EC<sub>50</sub> = 1.4 ± 1.9 µm). Carbachol stimulated 2-AG production in a manner that was independent of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and blocked by selective inhibition of diacylglycerol lipase. 2-AG returned to basal levels via a process mediated by monoacylglycerol lipase as indicated by slowed recovery in cultures treated with 4-[<i>Bis</i>(1,3-benzodioxol-5-yl)hydroxymethyl]-1-piperidinecarboxylic acid 4-nitrophenyl ester (JZL 184). Win 55,212-2 markedly desensitized CB<sub>1</sub> receptor function following a 1-day exposure, whereas desensitization was incomplete following 7-day treatment with JZL 184. This human cell culture model is well suited for functional analysis of the ECS and as a platform for drug development. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Despite known differences between the human response to cannabinoids and that of other species, an in vitro human model demonstrating a fully functional endocannabinoid system has not been described. Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) can be obtained from skin samples and then reprogrammed into neurons for use in basic research and drug screening.

The methods preserve the fluorescence of reporter proteins and seed shape, allowing phenotyping embryos in intact seeds. Tissue clearing methods eliminate the need for sectioning, thereby helping better understand the 3D organization of tissues and organs. In the past fifteen years, clearing methods have been developed to preserve endogenous fluorescent protein tags. Some of these methods (ClearSee, TDE, PEA-Clarity, etc.) were adapted to clear various plant species, with the focus on roots, leaves, shoot apical meristems, and floral parts. However, these methods have not been used in developing seeds beyond the early globular stage. Tissue clearing is problematic in post-globular seeds due to various apoplastic barriers and secondary metabolites. In this study, we compared six methods for their efficiency in clearing Arabidopsis thaliana seeds at post-globular embryonic stages. Three methods (TDE, ClearSee, and ClearSee alpha) have already been reported in plants, whereas the others (fsDISCO, FAST9, and CHAPS clear) are used in this context for the first time. These methods were assessed for seed morphological changes, clearing capacity, removal of tannins, and spectral properties. We tested each method in seeds from globular to mature stages. The pros and cons of each method are listed herein. ClearSee alpha appears to be the method of choice as it preserves seed morphology and prevents tannin oxidation. However, FAST9 with 60% iohexol as a mounting medium is faster, clears better, and appears suitable for embryonic shape imaging.

However, JHAs are rarely used in managing pests such as the fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda that cause damage during larval stages. The insecticides that antagonize JH action and induce stoppage of feeding and precocious metamorphosis might work better to control these pests. Treating insects with JHA insecticides induces the expression of an early JH response gene, Krüppel homolog 1 (Kr-h1) by working through JH response elements (JHRE) present in its promoter. In this study, we identified JHREs present in the promoter of Kr-h1 gene of a global pest, S. frugiperda, and used them to develop a JHRE-reporter cell platform to screen for JH analogs. JHA, methoprene induced the expression of SfKr-h1 both in vitro and in vivo. JHRE present in the promoters of two SfKr-h1 isoforms, SfKr-h1α and SfKr-h1β were identified. In Sf9 cells, the knockout of isoform-specific JHRE affected JH response in an isoform-specific manner. We also found that S. frugiperda JHRE (SfJHRE) did not function in the mosquito Aedes aegypti Aag2 cells and Tribolium castaneum TcA cells. Similarly, Ae. aegypti AaJHRE and T. castaneum TcJHRE were only functional in cells derived from these insects. The nucleotide sequence at the 3'end to the conserved core JHRE E-box sequence seems to be responsible for the species specificity observed. Two stable cell lines expressing the luciferase and enhanced green fluorescent protein genes under the control of SfJHRE were established. These cell lines responded well to JHA; these two JHRE-reporter cell lines could be used in screening assays to identify insecticides to manage S. frugiperda and other major pests.",

Absence of functional dystrophin results in muscle weakness and degeneration, eventually leading to cardiac and respiratory failure. Strategies to replace the missing dystrophin via gene therapy have been intensively pursued. However, the dystrophin gene is too large for current gene therapy approaches. Currently available micro-dystrophin constructs lack the actin-binding domain 2 and show decreased actin-binding affinity in vitro compared to full-length dystrophin. Thus, increasing the actin-binding affinity of micro-dystrophin, using small molecules, could be a beneficial therapeutic approach. Here, we have developed and validated a novel high-throughput screening (HTS) assay to discover small molecules that increase the binding affinity of dystrophin's actin-binding domain 1 (ABD1). We engineered a novel FRET biosensor, consisting of the mClover3, fluorescent protein (donor) attached to the C-terminus of dystrophin ABD1, and Alexa Fluor 568 (acceptor) attached to the C-terminal cysteine of actin. We used this biosensor in small-molecule screening, using a unique high-precision, HTS fluorescence lifetime assay, identifying several compounds from an FDA-approved library that significantly increase the binding between actin and ABD1.

        "abstract": "The T7 RNA polymerase is considered one of the most popular tools for heterologous gene expression in the gold standard biotechnological host <i>Escherichia coli</i>. However, the exploitation of this tool in other prospective hosts, such as the biotechnologically relevant bacterium <i>Pseudomonas putida</i>, is still very scarce. The majority of the existing T7-based systems in <i>P. putida</i> show low expression strengths and possess only weak controllability. A fundamental understanding of these systems is necessary in order to design robust and predictable biotechnological processes. To fill this gap, we established and characterized a modular T7 RNA polymerase-based system for heterologous protein production in <i>P. putida</i>, using the enhanced Green Fluorescent Protein (eGFP) as an easy-to-quantify reporter protein. We have effectively targeted the limitations associated with the initial genetic setup of the system, such as slow growth and low protein production rates. By replacing the T7 phage-inherent TΦ terminator downstream of the heterologous gene with the synthetic tZ terminator, growth and protein production rates improved drastically, and the T7 RNA polymerase system reached a productivity level comparable to that of an intrinsic RNA polymerase-based system. Furthermore, we were able to show that the system was saturated with T7 RNA polymerase by applying a T7 RNA polymerase ribosome binding site library to tune heterologous protein production. This saturation indicates an essential role for the ribosome binding sites of the T7 RNA polymerase since, in an oversaturated system, cellular resources are lost to the synthesis of unnecessary T7 RNA polymerase. Eventually, we combined the experimental data into a model that can predict the eGFP production rate with respect to the relative strength of the ribosome binding sites upstream of the T7 gene.",

To date there are no transgenic rat models available for precise manipulation of GLP1-expressing cells in the brain and periphery. To visualize and manipulate Gcg-expressing cells in rats, CRISPR/Cas9 was used to express iCre under control of the Gcg promoter. Gcg-Cre rats were bred with tdTomato reporter rats to tag Gcg-expressing cells. Cre-dependent AAVs and RNAscope in situ hybridization were used to evaluate the specificity of iCre expression by GLP1 neurons in the caudal nucleus of the solitary tract (cNTS) and intermediate reticular nucleus (IRt), and by intestinal and pancreatic secretory cells. Food intake was assessed in heterozygous (Het) Gcg-Cre rats after chemogenetic stimulation of cNTS GLP1 neurons expressing an excitatory DREADD. While genotype has minimal effect on body weight or composition in chow-fed Gcg-Cre rats, homozygous (Homo) rats have lower plasma glucose levels. In neonatal and adult Gcg-Cre/tdTom rats, reporter-labeled cells are present in the cNTS and IRt, and in additional brain regions (e.g., basolateral amygdala, piriform cortex) that lack detectable Gcg mRNA in adults but display transient developmental or persistently low Gcg expression. Compared to wildtype (WT) rats, hindbrain Gcg mRNA and GLP1 protein in brain and plasma are markedly reduced in Homo Gcg-Cre rats. Chemogenetic stimulation of cNTS GLP1 neurons reduced overnight chow intake in males but not females, the effect in males was blocked by antagonism of central GLP1 receptors, and hypophagia was enhanced when combined with a subthreshold dose of cholecystokinin-8 to stimulate gastrointestinal vagal afferents. Gcg-Cre rats are a novel and valuable experimental tool for analyzing the development, anatomy, and function of Gcg-expressing cells in the brain and periphery.

        "abstract": "Inteins (intervening proteins) are polypeptides that interrupt the sequence of other proteins and remove themselves through protein splicing. In this intein-catalyzed reaction, the two peptide bonds surrounding the intein are rearranged to release the intein from the flanking protein sequences, termed N- and C-exteins, which are concurrently joined by a peptide bond. Because of this unique functionality, inteins have proven exceptionally useful in protein engineering. Previous work has demonstrated that heterologous proteins can be inserted within an intein, with both the intein and inserted protein retaining function, allowing for intein-containing genes to coexpress additional coding sequences. Here, we show that a fluorescent protein (ZsGreen) can be inserted within the <i>Pyrococcus horikoshii</i> RadA intein, with the hybrid protein (ZsG-Int) maintaining fluorescence and splicing capability. We used this system to create a recombinant Ebola virus expressing a fluorescent protein. We first tested multiple potential insertion sites for ZsG-Int within individual Ebola virus proteins, identifying a site within the VP30 gene that facilitated efficient intein splicing in mammalian cells while also preserving VP30 function. Next, we successfully rescued a virus containing the ZsG-Int-VP30 fusion protein, which displayed fluorescence in the infected cells. We thus report a new intein-based application for adding reporters to systems without the need to add additional genes. Further, this work highlights a novel reporter design, whereby the reporter is only made if the protein of interest is translated and does not remain fused to the protein of interest.",

Thus, the fluorescence of the bacteria co-expressing the two fusion proteins accounts for the interaction of the two proteins of interest. The first split-GFP reassembly assay was devised in the early 2000s in Regan's lab. During the last ten years, we have been extensively using this assay to study the interactions of an intrinsically disordered protein (IDP) with two globular partners. Over that period, in addition to accumulating molecular information on the specific interactions under study, we progressively modified the original technique and tested various parameters. In those previous studies, however, we focused on the mechanistic insights provided by the approach, rather than on the method itself. Since methodological aspects deserve attention and the best bipartite reporter to study PPIs involving IDPs remains to be identified, we herein focus on technical aspects. To this end, we first revisit our previous modifications of the original method and then investigate the impact of a panel of additional parameters.

Although genetically encoded fluorescent indicators can be considered as a probe of choice for such measurements, they are hindered mostly by the inability to determine an absolute pH value and/or a narrow dynamic range of the signal, making them inefficient for recording the small pH changes that typically occur within cellular organelles. Here, we study the pH sensitivity of a green-fluorescence-protein (GFP)-based emitter (EGFP-Y145L/S205V) with the alkaline-shifted chromophore's pKa and demonstrate that, in the pH range of 7.5-9.0, its fluorescence lifetime changes by a factor of ~3.5 in a quasi-linear manner in mammalian cells. Considering the relatively strong lifetime response in a narrow pH range, we proposed the mitochondria, which are known to have a weakly alkaline milieu, as a target for live-cell pH measurements. Using fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) to visualize the HEK293T cells expressing mitochondrially targeted EGFP-Y145L/S205V, we succeeded in determining the absolute pH value of the mitochondria and recorded the ETC-uncoupler-stimulated pH shift with a precision of 0.1 unit.

The inhibition of CRM1 has emerged as a promising therapeutic approach to interfere with the lifecycle of many viruses, for the treatment of cancer, and to overcome therapy resistance. Recently, selinexor has been approved as the first CRM1 inhibitor for the treatment of multiple myeloma, providing proof of concept for this therapeutic option with a new mode of action. However, selinexor is associated with dose-limiting toxicity and hence, the discovery of alternative small molecule leads that could be developed as less toxic anticancer and antiviral therapeutics will have a significant impact in the clinic. Here, we report a CRM1 inhibitor discovery platform. The development of this platform includes reporter cell lines that monitor CRM1 activity by using red fluorescent protein or green fluorescent protein-labeled HIV-1 Rev protein with a strong heterologous nuclear export signal. Simultaneously, the intracellular localization of other proteins, to be interrogated for their capacity to undergo CRM1-mediated export, can be followed by co-culturing stable cell lines expressing fluorescent fusion proteins. We used this platform to interrogate the mode of nuclear export of several proteins, including PDK1, p110α, STAT5A, FOXO1, 3, 4 and TRIB2, and to screen a compound collection. We show that while p110α partially relies on CRM1-dependent nuclear export, TRIB2 is exported from the nucleus in a CRM1-independent manner. Compound screening revealed the striking activity of an organoselenium compound on the CRM1 nuclear export receptor.",

These properties make flavin-binding fluorescent proteins (FPs) a perspective platform for biosensor development. However, brightness of currently available flavin-binding FPs is limited compared to GFP-like FPs creating a need for their further enhancement and optimization. In this study, we applied a directed molecular evolution approach to develop a pair of flavin-binding FPs, named miniGFP1 and miniGFP2. The miniGFP proteins are characterized by cyan-green fluorescence with excitation/emission maxima at 450/499 nm and a molecular size of ∼13 kDa. We carried out systematic benchmarking of miniGFPs in <i>Escherichia coli</i> and cultured mammalian cells against spectrally similar FPs including GFP-like FP, bilirubin-binding FP, and bright flavin-binding FPs. The miniGFPs proteins exhibited improved photochemical properties compared to other flavin-binding FPs enabling long-term live cell imaging. We demonstrated the utility of miniGFPs for live cell imaging in bacterial culture under anaerobic conditions and in CHO cells under hypoxia. The miniGFPs' fluorescence was highly sensitive to Cu(II) ions in solution with K<sub>d</sub> values of 67 and 68 nM for miniGFP1 and miniGFP2, respectively. We also observed fluorescence quenching of miniGFPs by the reduced form of Cu(I) suggesting its potential application as an optical indicator for Cu(I) and Cu(II).

Syntaxin-2 (Stx2) has just been identified to be an inhibitory SNARE for insulin granule exocytosis, holding potential as a treatment for T2D, yet its molecular underpinnings remain unclear. We show that excessive Stx2 recruitment to raft-like granule docking sites at higher binding affinity than pro-fusion syntaxin-1A effectively competes for and inhibits fusogenic SNARE machineries. Depletion of Stx2 in human β-cells improves insulin secretion by enhancing trans-SNARE complex assembly and cis-SNARE disassembly. Using a genetically-encoded reporter, glucose stimulation is shown to induce Stx2 flipping across the plasma membrane, which relieves its suppression of cytoplasmic fusogenic SNARE complexes to promote insulin secretion. Targeting the flipping efficiency of Stx2 profoundly modulates secretion, which could restore the impaired insulin secretion in diabetes. Here, we show that Stx2 acts to assist this precise tuning of insulin secretion in β-cells, including in diabetes.",

This reporter consisted of a Firefly luciferase (Fluc) gene whose expression is regulated by the unique interaction architecture of the PUF protein with its Nanos response element (NRE) target RNA. We showed that a robust and rapid increase in the luminescence signal was detected by the successful delivery of siRNA against the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) or p53 genes into mammalian cells or the livers of mice. The delivery efficiencies of various commercial transfection vehicles were quantitatively evaluated with this reporter.

Here, we use geNOps; a ferrous iron-dependent genetically encoded fluorescent nitric oxide (NO) biosensor, to measure available iron in cellular locales. We exploited the nitrosylation-dependent fluorescence quenching of geNOps as a direct readout for cellular iron absorption, distribution, and availability. Our findings show that, in addition to ferrous iron salts, the complex of iron (III) with N,N'-bis (2-hydroxybenzyl)ethylenediamine-N,N'-diacetic acid (HBED) can activate the iron (II)-dependent NO probe within intact cells.

Following the optimization of various factors for protoplast release from mycelium, the protoplast-mediated transformation efficiency reached 89.3% (25/28) for N1 and 82.1% (32/39) for O1. The <i>A. tumefaciens</i>-mediated transformation efficiency was 98.2% (55/56) for N1 and 43.8% (28/64) for O1.

        "abstract": "Cerebral cavernous malformations (CCMs) are neurovascular lesions caused by loss of function mutations in 1 of 3 genes, including <i>KRIT1 (CCM1</i>), <i>CCM2</i>, and <i>PDCD10 (CCM3</i>). CCMs affect ≈1 out of 200 children and adults, and no pharmacologic therapy is available. CCM lesion count, size, and aggressiveness vary widely among patients of similar ages with the same mutation or even within members of the same family. However, what determines the transition from quiescent lesions into mature and active (aggressive) CCM lesions is unknown. We use genetic, RNA-sequencing, histology, flow cytometry, and imaging techniques to report the interaction between CCM endothelium, astrocytes, leukocytes, microglia/macrophages, neutrophils (CCM endothelium, astrocytes, leukocytes, microglia/macrophages, neutrophils interaction) during the pathogenesis of CCMs in the brain tissue. Expression profile of astrocytes in adult mouse brains using translated mRNAs obtained from the purification of EGFP (enhanced green fluorescent protein)-tagged ribosomes (<i>Aldh1l1-EGFP/Rpl10a</i>) in the presence or absence of CCM lesions (<i>Slco1c1-iCreERT2;Pdcd10<sup>fl/fl</sup>; Pdcd10<sup>BECKO</sup></i>) identifies a novel gene signature for neuroinflammatory astrocytes. CCM-induced reactive astrocytes have a neuroinflammatory capacity by expressing genes involved in angiogenesis, chemotaxis, hypoxia signaling, and inflammation. RNA-sequencing analysis on RNA isolated from brain endothelial cells in chronic <i>Pdcd10<sup>BECKO</sup></i> mice (CCM endothelium), identified crucial genes involved in recruiting inflammatory cells and thrombus formation through chemotaxis and coagulation pathways. In addition, CCM endothelium was associated with increased expression of <i>Nlrp3</i> and <i>Il1b</i>. Pharmacological inhibition of NLRP3 (NOD [nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain]-' LRR [leucine-rich repeat]- and pyrin domain-containing protein 3) significantly decreased inflammasome activity as assessed by quantification of a fluorescent indicator of caspase-1 activity (FAM-FLICA [carboxyfluorescein-fluorochrome-labeled inhibitors of caspases] caspase-1) in brain endothelial cells from <i>Pdcd10<sup>BECKO</sup></i> in chronic stage. Importantly, our results support the hypothesis of the crosstalk between astrocytes and CCM endothelium that can trigger recruitment of inflammatory cells arising from brain parenchyma (microglia) and the peripheral immune system (leukocytes) into mature active CCM lesions that propagate lesion growth, immunothrombosis, and bleedings. Unexpectedly, partial or total loss of brain endothelial NF-κB (nuclear factor κB) activity (using <i>Ikkb</i><sup><i>fl/fl</i></sup> mice) in chronic <i>Pdcd10<sup>BECKO</sup></i> mice does not prevent lesion genesis or neuroinflammation. Instead, this resulted in a trend increase in the number of lesions and immunothrombosis, suggesting that therapeutic approaches designed to target inflammation through endothelial NF-κB inhibition may contribute to detrimental side effects. Our study reveals previously unknown links between neuroinflammatory astrocytes and inflamed CCM endothelium as contributors that trigger leukocyte recruitment and precipitate immunothrombosis in CCM lesions. However, therapeutic approaches targeting brain endothelial NF-κB activity may contribute to detrimental side effects.",

This study synthesized a new series of coelenterazine (CTZ) analogues, named K-series, that selectively illuminates marine luciferases with unique, blue-shifted spectral properties. The optical property and specificity of the K-series CTZ analogues were characterized by marine luciferases, with K2 and K5 found to specifically luminesce with ALuc- and RLuc-series marine luciferases, respectively. The results confirmed that the luciferase specificity and color variation of the CTZ analogues minimize the cross-leakages of BL signals and enable high-throughput screening of specific ligands in the mixture. The specificity and color variation of the substrates were further tailored to marine luciferases (or single-chain bioluminescent probes) to create a multiplex quadruple assay system with four integrated, single-chain bioluminescent probes, with each probe designed to selectively luminesce only with its specific ligand (first authentication) and a specific CTZ analogue (second authentication).

Thorough monitoring of HCQ intake patients is in high demand; hence, we have developed a redox amino acid encoded fluorescent protein-based electrochemical biosensor for sensitive and selective detection of HCQ. This electrochemical biosensor is generated based on the two-electron transfer process between redox amino acid (3,4-dihydroxy-L-phenylalanine, DOPA) encoded bio-redox protein and the HCQ forms the conjugate. The DOPA residue in the bio-redox protein specifically binds with HCQ, thereby producing a remarkable electrochemical response on the glassy carbon electrode. Experimental results show that the developed biosensor selectively and sensitively detects the HCQ in spiked urine samples. The reagent-free bio-redox capacitor detects HCQ in the range of 90 nM to 4.4 µM in a solution with a detection limit of 58 nM, signal to noise ratio of 3:1, and strong anti-interference ability. Real-time screening, quantification, and relative mean recoveries of HCQ on spiked urine samples were monitored through electron shuttling using bio-redox protein and were found to be 97 to 101%. Overall, the developed bio-redox protein-based sensor has specificity, selectivity, reproducibility, and sensitivity making it potentially attractive for the sensing of HCQ and also applicable to clinical research.",

Insertion of intron 2 ST-LS1 into the viral L gene increased stability of the infectious clone in Escherichia coli and Agrobacterium tumefaciens.

Uniform systemic infection and high GFP expression were observed in maize inoculated with extracts of the infiltrated N. benthamiana leaves. Insect vectors supported virus infection when inoculated via feeding on infected maize or microinjection. Both MMV-WT and MMV-GFP were efficiently transmitted to maize by planthopper vectors.

It is necessary to investigate the relationship between the projection and functional information at the single neuron level for understanding the rules of neural circuit assembly, but a gap remains due to a lack of methods to map the function to whole-brain projection. Here an approach is developed to bridge two-photon calcium imaging in vivo with high-resolution whole-brain imaging based on sparse labeling with the genetically encoded calcium indicator GCaMP6. Reliable whole-brain projections are captured by the high-definition fluorescent micro-optical sectioning tomography (HD-fMOST). A cross-modality cell matching is performed and the functional annotation of whole-brain projection at the single-neuron level (FAWPS) is obtained. Applying it to the layer 2/3 (L2/3) neurons in mouse visual cortex, the relationship is investigated between functional preferences and axonal projection features. The functional preference of projection motifs and the correlation between axonal length in MOs and neuronal orientation selectivity, suggest that projection motif-defined neurons form a functionally specific information flow, and the projection strength in specific targets relates to the information clarity. This pipeline provides a new way to understand the principle of neuronal information transmission.",

These operations are performed by networks of excitatory and inhibitory neurons distributed through the cortical layers. Parvalbumin interneurons (PVIs) are the most abundant type of inhibitory cortical neuron. With axons projecting within and between layers, PVIs supply feedforward and feedback inhibition to control and modulate circuit function. Distinct populations of excitatory neurons recruit different PVI populations, but the specializations of these synapses are poorly understood. Here, we targeted a genetically encoded hybrid voltage sensor to PVIs and used fluorescence imaging in mouse somatosensory cortex slices to record their voltage changes. Stimulating a single visually identified excitatory neuron with small-tipped theta-glass electrodes depolarized multiple PVIs, and a common threshold suggested that stimulation elicited unitary synaptic potentials in response to a single excitatory neuron. Excitatory neurons depolarized PVIs in multiple layers, with the most residing in the layer of the stimulated neuron. Spiny stellate cells depolarized PVIs more strongly than pyramidal cells by up to 77%, suggesting a greater role for stellate cells in recruiting PVI inhibition and controlling cortical computations. Response half-width also varied between different excitatory inputs. These results demonstrate functional differences between excitatory synapses on PVIs.",

Herein, we demonstrate the development of bioluminescent sensors for label-free, template-free, separation-free, and sequence-independent detection of both clustered and isolated damage in genomic DNA based on the base-excision repair (BER) pathway and terminal transferase (TdT)-initiated template-free isothermal cyclic amplification. The damaged bases are cleaved by DNA glycosylase to generate a new 3'-OH terminus, and subsequently, TdT catalyzes the repeated incorporation of dTTPs into the 3'-OH terminus to produce poly-T structures which can hybridize with the signal probe to form a poly-T sequence/signal probe duplex. Under the lambda exonuclease hydrolysis, a large number of adenosine monophosphate (AMP) molecules are produced to generate a high bioluminescence signal through the cyclic interconversion of AMP-adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-AMP in the presence of luciferin and firefly luciferase. Moreover, the introduction of APE1-induced cyclic cleavage signal amplification can greatly improve the detection sensitivity. The proposed strategy can detect both clustered and isolated damage in genomic DNA with extremely high sensitivity and excellent specificity, and it can even distinguish 0.001% DNA damage in the mixture.

Known causes of tauopathy are myriad, and include point mutations within the tau gene, amyloid beta accumulation, repeated head trauma, and viral infection. We and others have proposed that tau has essential features of a prion. It forms intracellular assemblies that can exit a cell, enter a secondary cell, and serve as templates for their own replication in a process termed \"seeding.\" We have previously developed specialized \"biosensor\" cell systems to detect and quantify tau seeds in brain tissues. We hypothesized that progressive MS is a tauopathy, potentially triggered by inflammation. We tested for and detected tau seeding in frozen brain tissue of 6/8 subjects with multiple sclerosis. We then evaluated multiple brain regions from a single subject for whom we had detailed clinical history. We observed seeding outside of MS plaques that was enriched by immunopurification with two anti-tau antibodies (HJ8.5 and MD3.1). Immunohistochemistry with AT8 and MD3.1 confirmed prior reports of tau accumulation in MS. Although larger studies are required, our data suggest that progressive MS may be considered a secondary tauopathy.",

Elucidation of VOCs' mutation trends and evasion of neutralization is required to update current control measures. Mutations and the prevalence of VOCs were analyzed in the global immunization coverage rate context. Lentivirus-based pseudovirus neutralization analysis platforms for SARS-CoV-2 prototype strain (PS) and VOCs, containing Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, and Omicron, were constructed based on the spike protein of each variant and HEK 293T cell line expressing the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) receptor on the surface, and an enhanced green fluorescent protein reporter. Serum samples from 65 convalescent individuals and 20 WIBP-CorV vaccine recipients and four therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) namely imdevimab, casirivimab, bamlanivimab, and etesevimab were used to evaluate the neutralization potency against the variants. Pseudovirus-based neutralization assay platforms for PS and VOCs were established, and multiplicity of infection (MOI) was the key factor influencing the assay result. Compared to PS, VOCs may enhance the infectivity of hACE2-293T cells. Except for Alpha, other VOCs escaped neutralization to varying degrees. Attributed to favorable and emerging mutations, the current pandemic Omicron variant of all VOCs demonstrated the most significant neutralization-escaping ability to the sera and mAbs. Compared with the PS pseudovirus, Omicron had 15.7- and 3.71-fold decreases in the NT50 value (the highest serum dilution corresponding to a neutralization rate of 50%); and correspondingly, 90% and 43% of immunization or convalescent serum samples lost their neutralizing activity against the Omicron variant, respectively. Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 has evolved persistently with a strong ability to escape neutralization and prevailing against the established immune barrier. Our findings provide important clues to controlling the COVID-19 pandemic caused by new variants.",

The combination of the separation technique with adherent human cells applied on the same surface was recently shown to be possible. Since on-surface adherent cell assays are in their infancy, a planar bioluminescent cytotoxicity assay was developed to expand the possibilities. Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 or HeLa (cervical carcinoma) cells were chosen because of their fast growth rates and high rates of successful transfection, being suitable for the generation of genetically modified reporter cells. For the first time, HeLa cells were visualized on the wettable reversed phase plate surface using digital microscopy. For the generation of bioluminescent reporter cells, vectors for the expression of three luciferase enzymes of various origins were tested. The genetically modified HEK 293T-CMV-ELuc cells were the best suitable for the new planar cytotoxicity assay due to the faster growth rate, robustness, and stronger bioluminescence signal. The stable expression of luciferase under the control of a strong constitutive promoter allowed the cells to be used for the determination of the cytotoxicity of Saussurea costus root samples obtained from the market and to assess the authenticity of these samples. Any cytotoxic zone was detected as a dark zone inhibiting the cell bioluminescence. Five replicates of the dose-response curve confirmed the good assay performance and the cytotoxicity of a zone, which was assigned to costunolide and dehydrocostus lactone. By this, the proof-of-principle of the new planar bioluminescent cytotoxicity assay, which does not require expensive licensing, was successful.",

Chronic Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging of one month or longer was conducted for cultured cortical neurons expressing GCaMP-X, unveiling that spontaneous/local Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients progressively developed into autonomous/global Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations. Along with the morphological indices of neurite length and soma size, the major metrics of oscillatory Ca<sup>2+</sup>, including rate, amplitude and synchrony were also examined.

Due to the well-annotated and mapped zebrafish genome, numerous tools for gene editing have been developed. However, the efficacy of generating and ease of detecting precise knock-in edits using CRISPR is a limiting factor. Described here is a CRISPR-Cas9-based knock-in approach with the simple detection of precise edits in a gene responsible for cardiac repolarization and associated with the electrical disorder, Long QT Syndrome (LQTS).

        "abstract": "Cellular growth is a fundamental process of life and must be precisely controlled in multicellular organisms. Growth is crucially controlled by the number of functional ribosomes available in cells. The production of new ribosomes depends critically on the activity of RNA polymerase (RNAP) II in addition to the activity of RNAP I and III, which produce ribosomal RNAs. Indeed, the expression of both, ribosomal proteins and proteins required for ribosome assembly (ribosomal biogenesis factors), is considered rate-limiting for ribosome synthesis. Here, we used genetic screening to identify novel transcriptional regulators of cell growth genes by fusing promoters from a ribosomal protein gene (<i>Rpl18</i>) and from a ribosomal biogenesis factor (<i>Fbl</i>) with fluorescent protein genes (RFP, GFP) as reporters. Subsequently, both reporters were stably integrated into immortalized mouse fibroblasts, which were then transduced with a genome-wide sgRNA-CRISPR knockout library. Subsequently, cells with altered reporter activity were isolated by FACS and the causative sgRNAs were identified. Interestingly, we identified two novel regulators of growth genes. Firstly, the exon junction complex protein RBM8A controls transcript levels of the intronless reporters used here. By acute depletion of RBM8A protein using the auxin degron system combined with the genome-wide analysis of nascent transcription, we showed that RBM8A is an important global regulator of ribosomal protein transcripts. Secondly, we unexpectedly observed that the glycolytic enzyme aldolase A (ALDOA) regulates the expression of ribosomal biogenesis factors. Consistent with published observations that a fraction of this protein is located in the nucleus, this may be a mechanism linking transcription of growth genes to metabolic processes and possibly to metabolite availability.",

In this study, we used a new Rxfp4-Cre mouse model to investigate the mechanisms underlying these observations. We generated transgenic Rxfp4-Cre mice and investigated central expression of Rxfp4 by RT-qPCR, RNAscope and intraparenchymal infusion of INSL5. Rxfp4-expressing cells were chemogenetically manipulated in global Cre-reporter mice using designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs) or after stereotactic injection of a Cre-dependent AAV-DIO-Dq-DREADD targeting a population located in the ventromedial hypothalamus (RXFP4<sup>VMH</sup>).

Rxfp4-expressing cells in the hypothalamus were characterised by single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNAseq) and the connectivity of RXFP4<sup>VMH</sup> cells was investigated using viral tracing. Rxfp4-Cre mice displayed Cre-reporter expression in the hypothalamus. Active expression of Rxfp4 in the adult mouse brain was confirmed by RT-qPCR and RNAscope. Functional receptor expression was supported by cyclic AMP-responses to INSL5 application in ex vivo brain slices and increased HFD and highly palatable liquid meal (HPM), but not chow, intake after intra-VMH INSL5 infusion. scRNAseq of hypothalamic RXFP4 neurons defined a cluster expressing VMH markers, alongside known appetite-modulating neuropeptide receptors (Mc4r, Cckar and Nmur2). Viral tracing demonstrated RXFP4<sup>VMH</sup> neural projections to nuclei implicated in hedonic feeding behaviour. Whole body chemogenetic inhibition (Di-DREADD) of Rxfp4-expressing cells, mimicking physiological INSL5-RXFP4 Gi-signalling, increased intake of the HFD and HPM, but not chow, whilst activation (Dq-DREADD), either at whole body level or specifically within the VMH, reduced HFD and HPM intake and motivation to work for the HPM.

One approach to mitigating these artifacts is to image two channels simultaneously: one that captures an activity-dependent fluorophore, such as GCaMP, and another that captures an activity-independent fluorophore such as RFP. Because the activity-independent channel contains the same motion artifacts as the activity-dependent channel, but no neural signals, the two together can be used to identify and remove the artifacts. However, existing approaches for this correction, such as taking the ratio of the two channels, do not account for channel-independent noise in the measured fluorescence. Here, we present Two-channel Motion Artifact Correction (TMAC), a method which seeks to remove artifacts by specifying a generative model of the two channel fluorescence that incorporates motion artifact, neural activity, and noise. We use Bayesian inference to infer latent neural activity under this model, thus reducing the motion artifact present in the measured fluorescence traces. We further present a novel method for evaluating ground-truth performance of motion correction algorithms by comparing the decodability of behavior from two types of neural recordings; a recording that had both an activity-dependent fluorophore and an activity-independent fluorophore (GCaMP and RFP) and a recording where both fluorophores were activity-independent (GFP and RFP). A successful motion correction method should decode behavior from the first type of recording, but not the second. We use this metric to systematically compare five models for removing motion artifacts from fluorescent time traces. We decode locomotion from a GCaMP expressing animal 20x more accurately on average than from control when using TMAC inferred activity and outperforms all other methods of motion correction tested, the best of which were ~8x more accurate than control.",

        "abstract": "The influence of a protein is not determined exclusively by its level of expression, but also by its localization within the cell. The literature often refers to the enzyme monoamine oxidase (MAO) as a mitochondrial enzyme, yet there is evidence that mitochondria-independent pools of MAO exist. These pools of MAO could exert distinct influences across physiological as well as pathological phenotypes. Fluorescence microscopy is a powerful tool for spatially resolving target proteins in cell and tissue preparations. This can rely on an antibody-based probe that targets the endogenous protein, e.g., immunofluorescence. In the event that antibodies might not be readily available or if one is interested in characterizing a variant of the wild-type protein, then a recombinant protein with a fluorescent fusion \"tag\" is preferred. We now describe a protocol for the detection of endogenous MAO using indirect immunofluorescence and a version of the protocol with minor modification for detecting (green) fluorescent protein-tagged MAOs. One observation we can highlight using these easily adaptable approaches is that MAO A and MAO B do not follow similar patterns of distribution throughout the cell, suggesting potential expression of MAO A and MAO B on distinct pools of mitochondria. Furthermore, distinct subcellular compartmentalization is suggested by the fact that a pool of MAO A, but not MAO B, is associated with certain lysosomal compartments. However, directed and quantitative studies will be required before any definitive statement can be made on these intriguing possibilities.",

Calcium indicators that enable imaging of the dynamic activity of a large ensemble of neurons in behaving animals have revolutionized the field of neuroscience. Among these, transcription-based genetically encoded calcium indicators (transcriptional GECIs) have proven easy to use and do not depend on sophisticated imaging systems, offering unique advantages over other types of calcium indicators.

Many NRs in their unliganded state are localized in the cytoplasm. The ligand-inducible nuclear translocation of NRs provides a valuable tool for studying the NR-ligand interactions and their downstream effects. The translocation response of NRs can be studied irrespective of the nature of the interacting ligand (agonist, antagonist, or a small molecule modulator). These nuclear translocation studies offer an advantage over promoter-reporter-based transcription assays where transcription response is observed only with the activating hormones or agonistic ligands. Globally, milk serves as a major dietary source. However, suspected presence of endocrine/metabolism-disrupting chemicals like bisphenols, parabens, organochlorine pesticides, carbamates, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, chloramphenicol, brominated flame retardants, etc. has been reported. Considering that these chemicals may impart serious developmental and metabolism-related health concerns, it is essential to develop assays suitable for the detection of xenobiotics present at differing levels in milk. Since milk samples cannot be used directly on cultured cells or for microscopy, a combination of screening strategies has been developed herein based on the revelation that i) lipophilic NR ligands can be successfully retrieved in milk-fat; ii) milk-fat treatment of cells is compatible with live-cell imaging studies; and finally, iii) treatment of cells with xenobiotics-spiked and normal milk derived fat provides a visual and quantifiable response of NR translocation in living cells. Utilizing a milk-fat extraction method and Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) tagged NRs expressed in cultured mammalian cells, followed by an assessment of NR response proved to be an effective approach for screening xenobiotics present in milk samples.HighlightsDiverse endocrine and metabolism-disrupting chemicals are suspected to contaminate milk.Nuclear receptors serve as 'xenosensors' for assessing the presence of xenobiotics in milk.Nuclear import of steroid receptors with (ant)agonist can be examined in live cells.Lipophilic xenobiotics are extracted and observed enriched in milk-fat fraction.A comprehensive cell-based protocol aids in the detection of xenobiotics in milk.",

        "abstract": "Yellow fever virus (YFV), a member of the genus Flavivirus, family Flaviviridae, is the etiological agent for an acute viral hemorrhagic disease, yellow fever. Although effective live attenuated vaccines based on the strain YFV 17D are currently available, no specific antiviral drug is available, and the disease remains a major public health concern. Hence, the discovery and development of antiviral drugs should lead to great benefits in controlling the disease. To provide a screening platform for antiviral agents targeting YFV RNA translation/replication, we have established and characterized two Vero cell lines that persistently harbor a subgenomic replicon derived from YFV 17D-204 (referred to as replicon cells). The replicon carries YFV nucleotides (1 - 176 and 2382-10,862) and a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-Zeocin resistance fusion gene as a selection marker and indicator of persistent replication. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed that both replicon cells and YFV 17D-infected cells showed similar distribution patterns of viral NS4B protein and replication intermediate, double-stranded RNA. Sequencing analysis of persistent replicons from the two replicon cell lines suggested that their nucleotide sequences did not vary greatly following multiple passages. We examined the effect of five agents, the antiviral cytokines interferon-β and -γ, the nucleoside analog ribavirin, the squalene synthase inhibitor zaragozic acid A, and the antibiotic rifapentine, a recently reported entry and replication inhibitor against YFV, on the persistent replication in the two replicon cell lines. These agents were selected because they inhibited both production of YFV 17D and transient replication of a luciferase-expressing replicon in Vero cells, without greatly affecting cell viability. We found that each of the agents decreased GFP fluorescence in the replicon cells, albeit to varying degrees. The agents other than rifapentine also showed a decrease in viral RNA levels in the replicon cells comparable to that seen for GFP fluorescence. These results indicate that persistent replication is susceptible to each of these five agents, although their mechanisms of action may differ. Taken together, these results provide evidence that translation/replication of the replicon in the replicon cells mimics that of the viral genome upon YFV 17D infection, indicating that the replicon cell lines can serve as a useful tool for high-throughput antiviral drug screening.",

The current study aimed to determine if the same holds true for the production of colicin E9 in real time, by investigating the induction dynamics of the promoter of the ColE9 operon which results in the expression of the ColE9 activity and functional genes. A novel fluorescent reporter was constructed which carries the fusion of the ColE9 promoter and the gfpmut2 gene in a low copy number plasmid that was compatible with the native ColE9-J plasmid. Using the fluorescent reporter construct in the non colicinogenic E. coli cells, the induction of the ColE9 promoter was investigated. The current study demonstrates that the spontaneous induction of the ColE9 promoter occurs in a heterogenous manner and this heterogeneity is maintained in a bacterial population for several generations suggesting that it is unlikely due to any irreversible mutation in the bacterial culture. Furthermore, the same investigations were repeated using the colicin E9 producing E. coli cells. Flow cytometry analysis revealed that 7.1 ± 0.68% of the colicin E9 producing E. coli cells expressed GFP albeit only 2.45 ± 0.30% was observed from non colicinogenic E. coli cells. The considerable increase in the number of the fluorescent cells was likely due to the DNase activity of colicin E9 produced by their clonemates, resulting the auto-induction, which can be abolished with the inactivation of the DNase activity of the colicin E9.",

Cell-therapies have emerged as a potential treatment for numerous brain diseases. Despite recent advances in stem cell technology, major concerns have been raised regarding the feasibility and safety of cell therapies for clinical applications. We generated good manufacturing practice (GMP)-compatible neural progenitor cells (NPCs) from transgene- and xeno-free induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) that can be smoothly adapted for clinical applications. NPCs were characterized in vitro for their differentiation potential and in vivo after transplantation into wild type as well as genetically immunosuppressed mice. Generated NPCs had a stable gene-expression over at least 15 passages and could be scaled for up to 10<sup>18</sup> cells per initially seeded 10<sup>6</sup> cells. After withdrawal of growth factors in vitro, cells adapted a neural fate and mainly differentiated into active neurons. To ensure a pure NPC population for in vivo applications, we reduced the risk of iPSC contamination by applying micro RNA-switch technology as a safety checkpoint. Using lentiviral transduction with a fluorescent and bioluminescent dual-reporter construct, combined with non-invasive in vivo bioluminescent imaging, we longitudinally tracked the grafted cells in healthy wild-type and genetically immunosuppressed mice as well as in a mouse model of ischemic stroke. Long term in-depth characterization revealed that transplanted NPCs have the capability to survive and spontaneously differentiate into functional and mature neurons throughout a time course of a month, while no residual pluripotent cells were detectable. We describe the generation of transgene- and xeno-free NPCs.

        "abstract": "Applications of synthetic biology spanning human health, industrial bioproduction, and ecosystem monitoring often require small molecule sensing capabilities, typically in the form of genetically encoded small molecule biosensors. Critical to the deployment of greater numbers of these systems are methods that support the rapid development of such biosensors against a broad range of small molecule targets. Here, we use a previously developed method for selection of RNA biosensors against unmodified small molecules (DRIVER) to perform a selection against a densely multiplexed mixture of small molecules, representative of those employed in high-throughput drug screening. Using a mixture of 5,120 target compounds randomly sampled from a large diversity drug screening library, we performed a 95-round selection and then analyzed the enriched RNA biosensor library using next generation sequencing (NGS). From our analysis, we identified RNA biosensors with at least 2-fold change in signal in the presence of at least 217 distinct target compounds with sensitivities down to 25 nM. Although many of these biosensors respond to multiple targets, clustering analysis indicated at least 150 different small-molecule sensing patterns. We also built a classifier that was able to predict whether the biosensors would respond to a new compound with an average precision of 0.82. Since the target compound library was designed to be representative of larger diversity compound libraries, we expect that the described approach can be used with similar compound libraries to identify aptamers against other small molecules with a similar success rate. The new RNA biosensors (or their component aptamers) described in this work can be further optimized and used in applications such as biosensing, gene control, or enzyme evolution. In addition, the data presented here provide an expanded compendium of new RNA aptamers compared to the 82 small molecule RNA aptamers published in the literature, allowing further bioinformatic analyses of the general classes of small molecules for which RNA aptamers can be found.",

In vivo, they can be applied to dynamically monitor several physiological parameters in various subcellular compartments. Redox-sensitive green fluorescent protein 2 (roGFP2) senses the glutathione redox potential via a disulfide bridge formed between neighboring beta-strands of its beta-barrel structure. As changes in redox state affect both excitation maxima of roGFP2 oppositely, sensor responses are ratiometric. The reaction mechanism of roGFP2 is well characterized and involves an intermediate S-glutathionylation step. Thus, roGFP2 is also used in enzymatic in vitro assays, e.g., assessing glutaredoxin kinetics. In addition to the fluorescent read-out, the roGFP2 redox state can also be determined by differential migration on a non-reducing SDS-PAGE. This read-out mode may be beneficial in some applications, e.g., if mass-spectrometric analysis of posttranslational cysteine modifications is desired.

However, the ability of chiral recognition is difficult to achieve.

The previously reported methods based on chemical sensor arrays usually cannot carry out the chiral analysis.

This biosensor array could effectively discriminate chiral amino acids, including 19 L-amino acids, their corresponding D-enantiomers, and the achiral glycine. In addition, the determination of enantiomeric purity and quantitative ability has been proved. The successful identification of a complex system containing multiple chiral amino acids further demonstrates the superiority of the bioluminescent sensor array. Moreover, this sensor array could efficiently monitor the dynamic composition of free amino acids in the process of milk fermentation. Finally, the bioluminescence response mechanism of the luminescent bacteria for the recognition of chirality was clarified.

Coupling with indole C-5 was far more preferable in obtaining stable TINA-indole than enamine site C-3, as neither hydration of the triple bond to ketones nor competitive Glaser-type homocoupling of acetylenes was observed. The insertion of the new TINA monomer Y as a bulge in the middle or at the 5'-end of the oligodeoxynucleotide sequence <i>via</i> a flexible butane-1,2-diol linker showed extraordinary binding potential, resulting in excellent thermal stabilization of Hoogsteen-type triplex- and duplex-deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) structures which was detected by thermal denaturation studies and supported by circular dichroism (CD).

        "abstract": "Horizontal gene transfer is an important mechanism in bacterial evolution and can occur at striking frequencies when mediated by mobile genetic elements. Conjugative plasmids are mobile genetic elements that are main drivers of horizontal transfer and a major facilitator in the spread of antibiotic resistance genes. However, conjugative plasmid models that readily can be genetically modified with the aim to study horizontal transfer are not currently available. The aim of this study was to develop a conjugative plasmid model where the insertion of gene cassettes such as reporter genes (e.g., fluorescent proteins) or antibiotic resistance genes would be efficient and convenient. Here, we introduced a single attTn7 site into the conjugative broad-host-range IncP-1 plasmid pKJK5 in a non-disruptive manner. Furthermore, a version with lower transfer rate and a non-conjugative version of pKJK5-attTn7 were also constructed. The advantage of having the attTn7 sites is that genes of interest can be introduced in a single step with very high success rate using the Tn7 transposition system. In addition, larger genetic fragments can be inserted. To illustrate the efficacy of the constructed pKJK5 plasmids, they were complemented with sfGFP (a gene encoding superfolder green fluorescent protein) in addition to seven different β-lactamase genes representing the four known classes of β-lactamases.",

However, quantification of these features is often difficult, low-throughput, and imprecise due to the overreliance on human curation. Recently, we showed that convolutional neural network (CNN) models can outperform human curators in the assessment of neuronal death from images of fluorescently labeled neurons, suggesting that there is information within the images that indicates toxicity but that is not apparent to the human eye. In particular, the CNN's decision strategy indicated that information within the nuclear region was essential for its superhuman performance. Here, we systematically tested this prediction by comparing images of fluorescent neuronal morphology from nuclear-localized fluorescent protein to those from freely diffused fluorescent protein for classifying neuronal death. We found that biomarker-optimized (BO-) CNNs could learn to classify neuronal death from fluorescent protein-localized nuclear morphology (mApple-NLS-CNN) alone, with super-human accuracy. Furthermore, leveraging methods from explainable artificial intelligence, we identified novel features within the nuclear-localized fluorescent protein signal that were indicative of neuronal death. Our findings suggest that the use of a nuclear morphology marker in live imaging combined with computational models such mApple-NLS-CNN can provide an optimal readout of neuronal death, a common result of neurotoxicity.",

Here, application of single photon avalanche diode (SPAD) sensors is reported to image neural activity at kilohertz frame rates.

Serial imaging of skin from Thy-1 yellow fluorescent protein reporter mice by IVIS showed an increase in Thy-1 expression that correlated with onset and progression of fibrosis. In contrast to lung fibrosis, Thy-1-KO mice had attenuated skin fibrosis in both bleomycin and tight skin-1 murine models.

Importantly, GABA and NPY signaling, via the NPY Y1 receptor (Y1R), in the CeA modulate binge-like ethanol intake in rodents and these systems undergo neuroplastic alterations following a history of ethanol consumption. Here we assessed the roles of GABAergic and Y1R+ circuits arising from the CeA and innervating the lateral habenula (LHb), a brain region that modulates the aversive properties of ethanol, in modulating binge-like ethanol intake in mice using \"drinking in the dark\" (DID) procedures. Using an anterograde cre-inducible reporter virus we established the CeA → LHb circuit in male and female vgat-<i>ires</i>-cre and NPY1r-cre mice.

Finally, one, 4-day cycle of DID failed to alter basal or effects of ethanol or NPY on inhibitory transmission in Y1R+ CeA → LHb neurons.

To identify an ideal combination of GelMA and HAMA for chondrogenesis, a novel, primary human chondrocyte COL2A1-Gaussia luciferase reporter system (HuCol2gLuc) was developed. With this non-destructive, high-throughput temporal assay, Gaussia luciferase is secreted from the cells and used as a proxy for measuring type II collagen production. GelMA:HAMA ratios were screened using the reporter system before proceeding to 3D bioprinting. This method is efficient, saving on time and materials, resulting in a streamlined process of biomaterial optimization. The screen revealed that the addition of HAMA to GelMA improved chondrogenesis over GelMA (15%) alone. Storage moduli were measured using dynamic mechanical analysis of the same GelMA:HAMA ratios and established an initial threshold for chondrogenesis of ∼30kPa. To determine if biomaterial storage moduli impact cell mobility, human primary chondrocytes transduced with green fluorescent protein (GFP) were 3D bioprinted in either 1:1 or 2:1 ratios with storage moduli of 32kPa and 57.9kPa, respectively. We found that reduced cell mobility, in the stiffer biomaterial, had higher type II collagen expression, than the softer material with more cell mobility. Finally, after 3D bioprinting with HuCol2gLuc cells we successfully identified an optimal combination (2:1) of GelMA:HAMA and photo-crosslinking time (38s) for chondrogenesis. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: One challenge of 3D bioprinting is identifying ideal biomaterials that stimulate articular cartilage development. To identify an optimal combination of gelatin methacrylate and hyaluronic acid methacrylate for chondrogenesis we developed a primary human chondrocyte type II collagen Gaussia luciferase reporter cell (HuCol2gLuc). This non-destructive, high-throughput assay uses a secreted Gaussia luciferase as a proxy for temporal type II collagen production. This reporter system streamlines the biomaterial optimization process before 3D bioprinting. We also used it to determine the level of stiffness required for chondrogenesis. And for the first time, we quantified chondrocyte mobility in a 3D bioprinted construct. Together these results indicate that a biomaterial with a higher storage modulus and less cell mobility, improves chondrogenesis.",

We perform the selective detection of a target using the kinetics involved in a photochemical process and develop a correlation method that we illustrate by the titration of a fluorescent photoswitcher and the target of a photoswitching sensor. Correlating an input time series and a well-chosen weighting function associated with a variable characteristic time yields a spectrum of characteristic times. The upper integration limit of the correlation output can be chosen to match the argument of an extremum of the spectrum with a characteristic time of the input time series in order to quantify the target. A similar procedure is followed to optimize the signal-to-noise ratio. Selectivity and signal-to-noise ratio associated with 15 weighting functions are theoretically predicted. The results are applied to the titration of the reversibly photoswitchable fluorescent protein Dronpa-2 and the titration of calcium using a reversibly photoswitchable fluorescent sensor.

Consequently, retinal pericytes are attractive therapeutic targets for gene therapy, but effectively targeting pericytes with recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) vectors remains a challenge. We introduced genetic modifications into the surface-exposed variable regions of the rAAV2/2 capsid to generate a complex library (>1 × 107) of capsid mutants that were then screened for preferential tropism toward retinal pericytes. Using the Tg(Cspg4-DsRed.T1)1Akik/J reporter mouse model, which has red fluorescent pericytes that can be isolated via flow cytometry in order to recover vector genomes, we performed three rounds of screening and identified seven putative mutants capable of transducing retinal pericytes. Following intravitreal administration of mutant vectors packaging ubiquitously expressing green fluorescent protein reporters and postmortem flow cytometry of enzymatically digested retinae, two mutants in particular, Peri-E and Peri-G, demonstrated significantly greater transduction of retinal pericytes than unmodified rAAV2/2 (1.4-fold and 2.8-fold, respectively). Although difficult to characterize the effect of each point mutation in the context of multiple amino acid variations from the wild-type AAV2 sequence, we identified several point mutations that may play critical roles in limiting HSPG binding, evading neutralization by murine A20 monoclonal antibodies, modulating antigenicity, and evading ubiquitination to ultimately improve transduction efficiency of retinal pericytes. Identification of novel retinal pericyte targeting rAAV vectors enables the development of new, long-lasting gene therapies for retinal diseases such as diabetic retinopathy and wet age-related macular degeneration.",

This novel approach enables a fresh look at dopamine release patterns in the nucleus accumbens, following the medial forebrain bundle (mfb) DBS in a rodent model. Our results suggest reliable readouts of dopamine levels over at least 14 days of DBS-induced photometric measurements. We show that mfb-DBS can elicit an increased dopamine response during stimulation (5 s and 20 s DBS) compared to its baseline dopamine activity state, reaching its maximum peak amplitude in about 1 s and then recovering back after stimulation. The effect of different DBS pulse widths (PWs) also suggests a potential differential effect on this neurotransmitter response, but future studies would need to verify this.

Positive and negative social experiences evoke opposite DA patterns. Furthermore, DA releases during mating and fighting are sexually dimorphic with a higher level in males than in females.

Despite their everyday use in research, such instruments are costly and lack the flexibility to accommodate the variety of bioluminescence experiment formats that may require top or bottom signal acquisition, high or medium sensitivity, or multiple wavelength detection. To address the growing need for versatile technologies, we developed a highly customizable bioluminescence imager called Biolum' RGB that uses a consumer color digital camera with a high-aperture lens mounted at the bottom or top of a 3D-printed dark chamber and can quantify bioluminescence emission from cells grown in 384-well microplates and Petri dishes. Taking advantage of RGB detectors, Biolum' RGB can distinguish spectral signatures from various bioluminescence probes and quantify bioluminescence resonant energy transfer occurring during protein-protein interaction events. Although Biolum' RGB can be used with any smartphone, in particular for low bioluminescence signals, we recommend the use of recent digital cameras which offer better sensitivity and high signal/noise ratio. Altogether, Biolum' RGB combines the benefits of a plate reader and imager while providing better image resolution and faster acquisition speed, and as such, it offers an exciting alternative for any laboratory looking for a versatile, low-cost bioluminescence imaging instrument.",

In our study, we avoid such issues upon generating a new transgenic mouse (GFAP-E2crimson) expressing the far-red fluorescent protein E2-crimson under the control of the glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) promoter. Using microscopy, we validated the selective expression of the reporter in the astrocyte cell population and by non-invasive in vivo fluorescence imaging its detection through the scalps and skulls of live animals. In addition, we performed a longitudinal study validating by in vivo imaging that the E2-crimson fluorescence signal is up-regulated, in pups during astrogenesis and in adult mice during astrogliosis upon kainic acid administration. Furthermore, upon crossing GFAP-E2crimson transgenic with 5XFAD Alzheimer's disease mice model, we were able to quantify the chronic inflammation triggered by amyloid deposit and aging over 18 months.

To date, there is no report with respect to σA-modulated regulation of cellular fatty acid metabolism. This study reveals that the σA protein of ARV inhibits fatty acids synthesis and enhance fatty acid oxidation by upregulating PSMB6, which suppresses Akt, sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1), acetyl-coA carboxylase α (ACC1), and acetyl-coA carboxylase β (ACC2). SREBP1 is a transcription factor involved in fatty acid and cholesterol biosynthesis. Overexpression of SREBP1 reversed σA-modulated suppression of ACC1 and ACC2. In this work, a fluorescence resonance energy transfer-based genetically encoded indicator, Ateams, was used to study σA-modulated inhibition of fatty acids synthesis which enhances cellular ATP levels in Vero cells and human cancer cell lines (A549 and HeLa). By using Ateams, we demonstrated that σA-modulated inhibition of Akt, SREBP1, ACC1, and ACC2 leads to increased levels of ATP in mammalian and human cancer cells. Furthermore, knockdown of PSMB6 or overexpression of SREBP1 reversed σA-modulated increased levels of ATP in cells, indicating that PSMB6 and SREBP1 play important roles in ARV σA-modulated cellular fatty acid metabolism. Furthermore, we found that σA <sub>R155/273A</sub> mutant protein loses its ability to enter the nucleolus, which impairs its ability to regulate fatty acid metabolism and does not increase ATP formation, suggesting that nucleolus entry of σA is critical for regulating cellular fatty acid metabolism to generate more energy for virus replication.

Using inducible promoters to independently express SHKs and RRs, we detect RR dimerization within seconds of stimulus addition in several model pathways. We go on to combine experiments with mathematical modeling to reveal that TCS phosphosignaling accelerates with SHK expression but decelerates with RR expression and SHK phosphatase activity. We further observe pulsatile activation of the SHK NarX in response to addition and depletion of the extracellular electron acceptor nitrate when the corresponding TCS is expressed from both inducible systems and the native chromosomal operon.

It has been suggested, but not unequivocally proven, that hepatic progenitor cells (HPCs) can contribute to hepatocarcinogenesis. We aimed to determine whether HPCs contribute to HCC, cHCC-CCA or both types of tumors. To trace progenitor cells during hepatocarcinogenesis, we generated Mdr2-KO mice that harbor a yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) reporter gene driven by the Foxl1 promoter which is expressed specifically in progenitor cells. These mice (Mdr2-KO<sup>Foxl1-CRE;RosaYFP</sup>) develop chronic inflammation and HCCs by the age of 14-16 months, followed by cHCC-CCA tumors at the age of 18 months. In this Mdr2-KO<sup>Foxl1-CRE;RosaYFP</sup> mouse model, liver progenitor cells are the source of cHCC-CCA tumors, but not the source of HCC. Ablating the progenitors, caused reduction of cHCC-CCA tumors but did not affect HCCs. RNA-sequencing revealed enrichment of the IL-6 signaling pathway in cHCC-CCA tumors compared to HCC tumors. Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis revealed that IL-6 is expressed by immune and parenchymal cells during senescence, and that IL-6 is part of the senescence-associated secretory phenotype. Administration of an anti-IL-6 antibody to Mdr2-KO<sup>Foxl1-CRE;RosaYFP</sup> mice inhibited the development of cHCC-CCA tumors. Blocking IL-6 trans-signaling led to a decrease in the number and size of cHCC-CCA tumors, indicating their dependence on this pathway. Furthermore, the administration of a senolytic agent inhibited IL-6 and the development of cHCC-CCA tumors. Our results demonstrate that cHCC-CCA, but not HCC tumors, originate from HPCs, and that IL-6, which derives in part from cells in senescence, plays an important role in this process via IL-6 trans-signaling. These findings could be applied to develop new therapeutic approaches for cHCC-CCA tumors. Combined hepatocellular carcinoma-cholangiocarcinoma is the third most prevalent type of primary liver cancer (i.e. a cancer that originates in the liver). Herein, we show that this type of cancer originates in stem cells in the liver and that it depends on inflammatory signaling. Specifically, we identify a cytokine called IL-6 that appears to be important in the development of these tumors.

        "abstract": "Real-time imaging of reactive oxygen species (ROS) during cisplatin chemotherapy of cancer is imperative to fully reveal their functions in the biological response to cisplatin. Currently, using a bioluminescent probe for real-time imaging of a specific ROS in vivo during cisplatin chemotherapy has not been achieved. Herein, three bioluminescent probes, F Probe, N Probe and P Probe were synthesized for real-time imaging of the primary ROS, O<sub>2</sub><sup>•-</sup>. They all consisted of a bioluminescent emitter <sub>D</sub>-luciferin (<sub>D</sub>-LH<sub>2</sub>) and an O<sub>2</sub><sup>•-</sup>-recognition group, and their bioluminescent signal could be turned on in response to O<sub>2</sub><sup>•-</sup>. In vitro results indicated that P Probe was the most suitable one among the three probes for detection of O<sub>2</sub><sup>•-</sup>, with high sensitivity, excellent selectivity and stability. P Probe was then successfully applied for real-time imaging of O<sub>2</sub><sup>•-</sup> in both cancer cells and tumors during cisplatin chemotherapy. The imaging results demonstrated that O<sub>2</sub><sup>•-</sup> amount in cancer cells increased with the increasing dose of cisplatin, and that cisplatin-induced upregulation of O<sub>2</sub><sup>•-</sup> level in cancer cells was upstream of the cancer-killing pathway of cisplatin. We envision that P Probe may serve as an elucidative tool to further explore the role of O<sub>2</sub><sup>•-</sup> in cisplatin chemotherapy.",

        "abstract": "The ever-increasing number of chemicals and complex mixtures demands a time-saving and cost-effective platform for environmental risk assessment. However, there is limit promising tool for evaluating the contribution of each component to the total toxicity effects of the mixture. Here, four widely distributed environmental pollutants with different mode-of-actions, i.e., cadmium chloride (Cd), nitrofurazone (NFZ), triclosan (TCS), and tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP), were selected as components of artificial mixture. Integration of leave-one-out method and high-dimensional live cell array system was used to explore relative contribution of each component from the mixture. A quaternary mixture (All_4_chems) and four ternary mixtures (Leave_Cd, Leave_NFZ, Leave_TCS and Leave_TCEP) were investigated by Escherichia coli (E. coli) live cell array system with 90 environmental stress genes modified by green fluorescent protein (GFP) expressing reporter vectors. E. coli cytotoxicity tests demonstrated that TCS has antagonism effect with other three chemicals (Cd, NFZ and TCEP), while it was additive effect in other three binary combinations. A total of 26, 23, 13, 31 and 23 genes were significantly altered with fold-change greater than 2 over the 4 h exposure by All_4_chems, Leave_Cd, Leave_NFZ, Leave_TCS and Leave_TCEP, respectively. Clustering analysis based on time-series gene expression patterns and transcriptional effect level index (TELI) showed that Leave_TCEP has similar profiles with All_4_chems, demonstrating TCEP has the least contribution among four components to the quaternary mixture. Leave_NFZ has the least number of significantly altered genes, implying NFZ has the largest toxicity effect contribution to the quaternary mixture. The relative contribution in different pathways indicated that Cd has the most contribution to the mixture in redox stress, while TCS has the least contribution in DNA stress pathway. Collectively, our results demonstrated the utility of high-dimensional toxicogenomics data and leave-one-out method in prioritizing the relative contribution of each component in mixture.",

Therefore, we generated novel lineage-specific RNA interference (RNAi) lentiviral vectors, H23B-Ery-Lin-shRNA and H234B-Ery-Lin-shRNA, to probe the functions of these genes in erythroid cells without affecting other hematopoietic lineages. The lineage specificity of these vectors was confirmed by transducing multiple hematopoietic cells to express a fluorescent protein. Unlike the previously reported erythroid lineage RNAi vector, our vectors were designed for cloning the short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) for any gene, and they also provide superior knockdown of the target gene expression with a single shRNA integration per cell. High-level lineage-specific downregulation of BCL11A and ZBTB7A, two well-characterized transcriptional repressors of HBG in adult erythroid cells, was achieved with substantial induction of fetal hemoglobin with a single-copy lentiviral vector integration. Transduction of primary healthy donor CD34<sup>+</sup> cells with these vectors resulted in >80% reduction in the target protein levels and up to 40% elevation in the γ-chain levels in the differentiated erythroid cells. Xenotransplantation of the human CD34<sup>+</sup> cells transduced with H23B-Ery-Lin-shBCL11A LV in immunocompromised mice showed ~ 60% reduction in BCL11A protein expression with ~ 40% elevation of γ-chain levels in the erythroid cells derived from the transduced CD34<sup>+</sup> cells. Overall, the novel erythroid lineage-specific lentiviral RNAi vectors described in this study provide a high-level knockdown of target gene expression in the erythroid cells, making them suitable for their use in gene therapy for hemoglobinopathies. Additionally, the design of these vectors also makes them ideal for high-throughput RNAi screening for studying normal and pathological erythropoiesis.",

An attractive early sensing approach of non-visible infections is based on volatile organic compounds (VOCs). In this study, a whole-cell bacterial biosensor was used for the identification of RPW in date palm (Phoenix dactylifera). The cells are genetically modified to produce light in the presence of general stresses. The bioluminescent bacterial panel is based on three genetically engineered Escherichia coli strains that are sensitive to cytotoxicity (TV1061), genotoxicity (DPD2794), or quorum-sensing (K802NR). The bioluminescent bacterial panel detects the presence of VOCs and a change in the light signal is then generated, reflecting the health status of the date palm tree. The bioreporter bacteria cells are immobilized in calcium alginate tablets and placed in a sealed jar without direct contact with the tested sample, thereby exposing them only to the VOCs in the surrounding air. The immobilized bacteria cells were exposed to the air near infected by RPW or uninfected sugar canes, date palm tree pieces, and on date palm trees. Commercial plate reader was used for signal measurement. The findings show that quorum-sensing was induced by all the tested samples of infected sugar canes, date palm tree pieces, and date palm trees. While, cytotoxicity was induced only by infected date palm tree pieces, and genotoxicity was induced only by infected date palm trees.

It has been used for years to study odorant-induced responses in insects (i.e., honeybees, <i>Drosophila</i>, and moths) and was recently introduced into mosquitoes. Traditionally, calcium imaging in mosquitoes was performed using nonspecific calcium indicator dyes to examine neuronal responses in whole insect brain regions, but the development of genetically encoded calcium indicators (GECIs) has facilitated the ability to perform functional calcium imaging on specific tissues. For example, by specifically expressing a GECI in olfactory neurons, the odor-induced responses of these neurons in peripheral organs can be examined. Calcium imaging of mosquito antennae further provides an advantageous method for simultaneously visualizing the activity of several antennal neurons in a single experiment. In this protocol, we describe a calcium imaging method to study odor-evoked responses in <i>Anopheles coluzzii</i> antennae expressing the calcium indicator GCaMP6f. This method requires imaging equipment (compound microscope, light sources, and camera), an odorant delivery system, and image acquisition software. The mosquito preparation is straightforward but requires practice to minimize mosquito movement during imaging. Recorded videos can be analyzed using Fiji software to generate heatmaps and activity traces for odorant-evoked responses. This protocol can also be used, with some modifications, to study other peripheral organs (such as labella, palps, and tarsi).",

To elucidate the behavior of the BM during epithelial morphogenesis, we attempted to live-label the developing BM with recombinant human nidogen-1 fused to an enhanced green fluorescent protein (hNid1-EGFP). Submandibular glands of mouse embryos were cultured in glass-bottomed dishes and incubated in media containing hNid1-EGFP. Subsequent confocal microscopy clearly visualized the BMs surrounding the epithelial end buds. On three-dimensional reconstruction from Z-series confocal sections, the epithelial BM was observed as a thin sheet that expanded continuously around the entire epithelial basal surface. Because the explants continued to grow well in the presence of hNid1-EGFP, time-lapse confocal microscopy was performed to follow the dynamics of the BM. We found that the epithelial BM is an adaptive structure that deforms in accordance with the rapid shape changes of the developing epithelium. Furthermore, hNid1-EGFP was found to be incorporated differently into the epithelial BM compared with that reported for fibronectin or type IV collagen, suggesting that individual BM components assemble in different ways to form the BM.",

The autophagic flux assays currently available for mammalian cells are generally complicated and do not yield highly quantitative results. Yeast autophagic flux is routinely monitored with the green fluorescence protein (GFP)-based processing assay, whereby the amount of GFP proteolytically released from GFP-containing reporters (e.g. GFP-Atg8), detected by immunoblotting, reflects autophagic flux. However, this simple and effective assay is typically inapplicable to mammalian cells because GFP is efficiently degraded in lysosomes while the more proteolytically resistant red fluorescent protein (RFP) accumulates in lysosomes under basal conditions. Here, we report a HaloTag (Halo)-based reporter processing assay to monitor mammalian autophagic flux. We found that Halo is sensitive to lysosomal proteolysis but becomes resistant upon ligand binding. When delivered into lysosomes by autophagy, pulse-labeled Halo-based reporters (e.g. Halo-LC3 and Halo-GFP) are proteolytically processed to generate Halo<sup>ligand</sup> when delivered into lysosomes by autophagy. Hence, the amount of free Halo<sup>ligand</sup> detected by immunoblotting or in-gel fluorescence imaging reflects autophagic flux. We demonstrate the applications of this assay by monitoring the autophagy pathways, macroautophagy, selective autophagy, and even bulk nonselective autophagy. With the Halo-based processing assay, mammalian autophagic flux and lysosome-mediated degradation can be monitored easily and precisely.",

Chronic administration of meth results in SNc degeneration and MAO inhibition is neuroprotective, whereas, the VTA is resistant to degeneration. This differential vulnerability is attributed, at least in part, to the presence of L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel-dependent mitochondrial stress in SNc but not VTA dopamine neurons. MAO is also expressed in other monoaminergic neurons such as noradrenergic locus coeruleus (LC) and serotonergic dorsal raphe (DR) neurons. The impact of meth on mitochondrial stress in LC and DR neurons is unknown. In the current study we used a genetically encoded redox biosensor to investigate meth-induced MAO-dependent mitochondrial stress in LC and DR neurons. Similar to SNc and VTA neurons, meth increased MAO-dependent mitochondrial stress in axonal but not somatic compartments of LC norepinephrine and DR serotonin neurons. Chronic meth administration (5 mg/kg; 28-day) resulted in degeneration of LC neurons and MAO inhibition was neuroprotective whereas DR neurons were resistant to degeneration. Activating L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels increased mitochondrial stress in LC but not DR axons and inhibiting L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels <i>in vivo</i> with isradipine prevented meth-induced LC degeneration.

In the current work, CIP was studied in aqueous environment based on a natural fluorescing compound called phycocyanin (PC). Using, a Spectro fluorophotometer, fluorescence detection of CIP was performed, and absorbance properties were studied using a UV-Visible spectrophotometer. In addition, a circular dichroism (CD) spectrophotometer and molecular docking analysis were implemented for further investigation. As the fluorometric measurement results showed, the fluorescence intensity of PC dropped linearly upon the addition of increasing amounts of CIP ranging from 0 to 120 μmol/L of final concentrations, with the limit of detection reaching down to 95 nM. In addition, the fluorescent sensor was found to be more selective towards CIP when tested against other six antibiotics and six pesticides. In the case of analysis of the PC-CIP interaction using a CD spectrophotometer the α-helix content of PC decreased in the presence of CIP, which is an indication of conformational changes in the secondary structure of PC. Moreover, the molecular docking analysis of the PC-CIP interaction assisted in locating the three sites where CIP binds with CIP, which in turn provided additional instances of the interaction mechanism between PC and CIP.",

However, it remains challenging to evaluate and identify strains with the desired phenotype from the vast rational or random mutagenesis library. One effective approach to resolve this bottleneck is to design an efficient high-throughput screening (HTS) method to rapidly detect and analyze target candidates. L-cysteine is an important sulfur-containing amino acid and has been widely used in agriculture, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, and food additive industries. However, HTS methods that enable monitoring of L-cysteine levels and screening of the enzyme variants and strains to confer superior L-cysteine biosynthesis remain unavailable, greatly limiting the development of efficient microbial cell factories for L-cysteine production at the industrial scale. Here, we took advantage of the L-cysteine-responsive transcriptional regulator CcdR to develop a genetically encoded biosensor for engineering and screening the L-cysteine overproducer. The in vivo L-cysteine-responsive assays and in vitro electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and DNase I footprint analysis indicated that CcdR is a transcriptional activator that specifically interacts with L-cysteine and binds to its regulatory region to induce the expression of target genes. To improve the response performance of the L-cysteine biosensor, multilevel optimization strategies were performed, including regulator engineering by semi-rational design and systematic optimization of the genetic elements by modulating the promoter and RBS combination. As a result, the dynamic range and sensitivity of the biosensor were significantly improved. Using this the excellent L-cysteine biosensor, a HTS platform was established by coupling with fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and was successfully applied to achieve direct evolution of the key enzyme in the L-cysteine biosynthetic pathway to increase its catalytic performance and to screen the high L-cysteine-producing strains from the random mutagenesis library. These results presented a paradigm of design and optimization of biosensors to dynamically detect metabolite concentrations and provided a promising tool enabling HTS and metabolic regulation to construct L-cysteine hyperproducing strains to satisfy industrial demand.",

Still, the underlying mechanistic pathways that regulate glucagon secretion remain controversial. Among the three complementary main mechanisms (intrinsic, paracrine, and juxtacrine) proposed to regulate glucagon release from α-cells, juxtacrine interactions are the least studied. It is known that tonic stimulation of α-cell EphA receptors by ephrin-A ligands (EphA forward signaling) inhibits glucagon secretion in mouse and human islets and restores glucose inhibition of glucagon secretion in sorted mouse α-cells, and these effects correlate with increased F-actin density. Here, we elucidate the downstream target of EphA signaling in α-cells. We demonstrate that RhoA, a Rho family GTPase, plays a key role in this pathway. Pharmacological inhibition of RhoA disrupts glucose inhibition of glucagon secretion in islets and decreases cortical F-actin density in dispersed α-cells and α-cells in intact islets. Quantitative FRET biosensor imaging shows that increased RhoA activity follows directly from EphA stimulation.

Recent studies have suggested that activation of P2-purinergic receptors (P2Rs) may be involved in neuron-satellite glial cell (SGC) interactions in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG), but the details remain unclear. In DRG, P2X7R is selectively expressed in SGCs, which closely surround neurons, and is highly sensitive to 3'-O-(4-Benzoyl) benzoyl-ATP (BzATP). Using calcium imaging in intact mice to survey a large number of DRG neurons and SGCs, we examined how intra-ganglionic purinergic signaling initiated by BzATP affects neuronal activities in vivo. We developed <i>GFAP</i>-GCaMP6s and <i>Pirt</i>-GCaMP6s mice to express the genetically encoded calcium indicator GGCaM6s in SGCs and DRG neurons, respectively. The application of BzATP to the ganglion induced concentration-dependent activation of SGCs in <i>GFAP</i>-GCaMP6s mice. In <i>Pirt</i>-GCaMP6s mice, BzATP initially activated more large-size neurons than small-size ones. Both glial and neuronal responses to BzATP were blocked by A438079, a P2X7R-selective antagonist. Moreover, blockers to pannexin1 channels (probenecid) and P2X3R (A317491) also reduced the actions of BzATP, suggesting that P2X7R stimulation may induce the opening of pannexin1 channels, leading to paracrine ATP release, which could further excite neurons by acting on P2X3Rs. Importantly, BzATP increased the responses of small-size DRG neurons and wide-dynamic range spinal neurons to subsequent peripheral stimuli. Our findings suggest that intra-ganglionic purinergic signaling initiated by P2X7R activation could trigger SGC-neuron interaction in vivo and increase DRG neuron excitability.",

However, their potential for widespread diffusion is limited by restrictive cellular factors that block viral replication in the cells of many species. In previous studies, we demonstrated that the restriction of CAEV infection of sheep choroid plexus cells was due to aberrant post-translation cleavage of the CAEV Env gp170 precursor. Later, we showed that the lack of specific receptor(s) for caprine encephalitis arthritis virus (CAEV) on the surface of human cells was the only barrier to their infection. Here, we examined whether small ruminant (SR) cells can support the replication of primate LVs. Three sheep and goat cell lines were inoculated with cell-free HIV-1 and SIVmac viral stocks or transfected with infectious molecular clone DNAs of these viruses. The two recombinant lentiviral clones contained the green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter sequence. Infection was detected by GFP expression in target cells, and the infectious virus produced and released in the culture medium of treated cells was detected using the indicator TZM-bl cell line. Pseudotyped HIV-GFP and SIV-GFP with vesicular stomatitis virus G glycoprotein (VSV-G) allowed the cell receptors to be overcome for virus entry to further evaluate the viral replication/restriction in SR cells. As expected, neither HIV nor SIV viruses infected any of the SR cells. In contrast, the transfection of plasmid DNAs of the infectious molecular clones of both viruses in SR cells produced high titers of infectious viruses for human indicators, but not SR cell lines. Surprisingly, SR cells inoculated with HIV-GFP/VSV-G, but not SIV-GFP/VSV-G, expressed the GFP and produced a virus that efficiently infected the human indictor, but not the SR cells. Collectively, these data provide a demonstration of the lack of replication of the SIVmac genome in SR cells, while, in contrast, there was no restriction on the replication of the IV-1 genome in these cells. However, because of the lack of functional receptors to SIVmac and HIV-1 at the surface of SR cells, there is specific lentiviral entry.",

Thus, improving the strength and specificity of <i>A. tumefaciens</i> to target cells has the potential for enhancing DNA transfer for biotechnological and therapeutic purposes. Here, we demonstrate a methodology for engineering genetically encoded exogeneous adhesins at the surface of <i>A. tumefaciens</i>. We identified an autotransporter gene we named Aat that is predicted to show canonical β-barrel and passenger domains. We engineered the β-barrel scaffold and linker (Aat<sub>β</sub>) to display synthetic adhesins susceptible to rewire <i>A. tumefaciens</i> to alternative host targets. As a proof of concept, we leveraged the versatility of a VHH domain to rewire <i>A. tumefaciens</i> adhesion to yeast and mammalian hosts displaying a GFP target receptor. Finally, to demonstrate how synthetic <i>A. tumefaciens</i> adhesion can improve transfer to host cells, we showed improved protein translocation into HeLa cells using a sensitive split luciferase reporter system.

Despite the availability of various antifungals, therapy remains challenging and requires further studies. Accordingly, the clinical <i>A. fumigatus</i> isolate NIH4215 deriving from a fatal case of human pulmonary aspergillosis has frequently been used in drug efficacy studies. Unexpectedly, our initial attempts to generate a bioluminescent reporter of strain NIH4215 for <i>in vivo</i> drug efficacy studies failed, as NIH4215 was unable to grow on defined minimal medium. Subsequent analyses discovered a previously undescribed thiamine auxotrophy of strain NIH4215 and transformation with thiamine biosynthesis genes from <i>A. fumigatus</i> strain Af293 identified the <i>nmt1</i> gene as cause of the thiamine auxotrophy. Sequencing of the defective <i>nmt1</i> gene revealed the loss of a cysteine codon within an essential iron-binding motif. Subsequently, the wild-type <i>nmt1</i> gene was successfully used to generate a bioluminescent reporter strain in NIH4215 by simultaneously deleting the <i>akuB</i> locus. The resulting bioluminescent Δ<i>akuB</i> strains showed a high frequency of homologous integration as confirmed by generation of <i>pyrG</i> and <i>niaD</i> deletion mutants. When tested in a <i>Galleria mellonella</i> infection model, neither thiamine auxotrophy nor the deletion of the <i>akuB</i> locus had a significant effect on virulence. However, besides thiamine auxotrophy, sectors with altered morphology and albino mutants frequently arose on colony edges of strain NIH4215 and its derivatives, and stable albino mutants were successfully isolated. A proposed increased mutation rate of NIH4215 was confirmed by screening for spontaneous occurrence of fluoorotic acid resistant mutants. Independent mutations in the <i>pyrG</i> and <i>pyrE</i> gene were identified in the fluoroorotic acid resistant NIH4215 isolates and the frequency of mutation was by at least one order of magnitude higher than that observed for the clinical <i>A. fumigatus</i> isolate CBS144.89. In summary, despite its virulence in animal models, strain NIH4215 is a thiamine auxotroph and prone to accumulate mutations. Our results suggest that thiamine biosynthesis is dispensable for host infection and mutation-prone strains such as NIH4215 could potentially facilitate the evolution of azole resistant strains as increasingly observed in the environment.",

Here, we used Green-enhanced Nano-lantern (GeNL), a chimeric protein of the luciferase NanoLuc (Nluc) and the green fluorescent protein mNeonGreen (mNG), as a ratiometric pH indicator based on the pH dependency of bioluminescence resonance energy transfer efficiency from Nluc to mNG.

This approach typically involves inducing expression of a fluorescent protein and then tracking partitioning of fluorescence into daughter cells. However, fluorescence can be diluted very quickly within a rapidly replicating population, such as pathogenic bacterial populations replicating within host tissues. To overcome this limitation, we have generated two revTetR reporter constructs, where either mCherry or yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) is constitutively expressed and repressed by addition of tetracyclines, resulting in fluorescence dilution within defined time frames. We show that fluorescent signals are diluted in replicating populations and that signal accumulates in growth-inhibited populations, including during nitric oxide (NO) exposure. Furthermore, we show that tetracyclines can be delivered to the mouse spleen during Yersinia pseudotuberculosis infection and defined a drug concentration that results in even exposure of cells to tetracyclines. We then used this system to visualize bacterial cell division within defined time frames postinfection. revTetR-mCherry allowed us to detect slow-growing cells in response to NO in culture; however, this strain had a growth defect within mouse tissues, which complicated results. To address this issue, we constructed revTetR-YFP using the less toxic YFP and showed that heightened NO exposure correlated with heightened YFP signal, indicating decreased cell division rates within this subpopulation <i>in vivo</i>.

IBV evolution under the pressure of comprehensive and widespread vaccination requires surveillance for vaccine resistance, as well as periodic vaccine updates. Reverse genetics systems are very valuable tools in virology, as they facilitate rapid genetic manipulation of viral genomes, thereby advancing basic and applied research. We report here the construction of an infectious clone of IBV strain Beaudette as a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC). The engineered full-length IBV clone allowed the rescue of an infectious virus that was phenotypically indistinguishable from the parental virus. We used the infectious IBV clone and examined whether an enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) can be produced by the replicase gene ORF1 and autocatalytically released from the replicase polyprotein through cleavage by the main coronavirus protease. We show that IBV tolerates insertion of the EGFP ORF at the 3' end of the replicase gene, between the sequences encoding nsp13 and nsp16 (helicase, RNA exonuclease, RNA endonuclease, and RNA methyltransferase). We further show that EGFP is efficiently cleaved from the replicase polyprotein and can be localized in double-membrane vesicles along with viral RNA polymerase and double-stranded RNA, an intermediate of IBV genome replication. One of the engineered reporter EGFP viruses were genetically stable during passage in cultured cells. We demonstrate that the reporter EGFP viruses can be used to study virus replication in host cells and for antiviral drug discovery and development of diagnostic assays. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Reverse genetics systems based on bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) are the most valuable systems in coronavirus research. Here, we describe the establishment of a reverse genetics system for the avian coronavirus strain Beaudette, the most intensively studied strain. We cloned a copy of the avian coronavirus genome into a BAC vector and recovered infectious virus in permissive cells. We used the new system to construct reporter viruses that produce enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP). The EGFP coding sequence was inserted into 11 known cleavage sites of the major coronavirus protease in the replicase gene ORF1. Avian coronavirus tolerated the insertion of the EGFP coding sequence at three sites. The engineered reporter viruses replicated with parental efficiency in cultured cells and were sufficiently genetically stable. The new system facilitates functional genomics of the avian coronavirus genome but can also be used for the development of novel vaccines and anticoronaviral drugs.",

The plasma membrane Ca<sup>2+</sup> ATPase (PMCA) is a major player to limit the duration of cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals. It forms complexes with the glycoprotein neuroplastin (Np) isoforms Np55 and Np65 and functionally interplays with N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-type ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluNRs). Moreover, binding of the Np65-specific extracellular domain to Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable GluA1-containing α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA)-type ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluA1Rs) was found to be required for long-term potentiation (LTP). However, the link between PMCA and iGluRs function to regulate cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals remained unclear. Here, we report that Np65 coordinates PMCA and iGluRs' functions to modulate the duration and amplitude of cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in dendrites and spines of hippocampal neurons. Using live-cell Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging, acute pharmacological treatments, and GCaMP5G-expressing hippocampal neurons, we discovered that endogenous or Np65-promoted PMCA activity contributes to the restoration of basal Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels and that this effect is dependent on iGluR activation. Super-resolution STED and confocal microscopy revealed that electrical stimulation increases the abundance of synaptic neuroplastin-PMCA complexes depending on iGluR activation and that low-rate overexpression of Np65 doubled PMCA levels and decreased cell surface levels of GluN2A and GluA1 in dendrites and Shank2-positive glutamatergic synapses. In neuroplastin-deficient hippocampi, we observed reduced PMCA and unchanged GluN2B levels, while GluN2A and GluA1 levels were imbalanced. Our electrophysiological data from hippocampal slices argues for an essential interplay of PMCA with GluN2A- but not with GluN2B-containing receptors upon induction of synaptic plasticity. Accordingly, we conclude that Np65 may interconnect PMCA with core players of glutamatergic neurotransmission to fine-tune the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal regulation in basal synaptic function and plasticity.",

Many attempts to increase the dynamic range have relied on amplifying the input signal from the analyte, which can lead to complications of false positives. In this study, we aimed to increase the protein synthesis capability of the cell-free protein synthesis system and the output signal of the reporter protein to achieve a lower limit of detection. We utilized a new fluorescent protein, mNeonGreen, which produces a higher output than those commonly used in cell-free biosensors. Optimizations of DNA sequence and the subsequent cell-free protein synthesis reaction conditions allowed characterizing protein expression variability by given DNA template types, reaction environment, and storage additives that cause the greatest time constraint on designing the cell-free biosensor. Finally, we characterized the fluorescence kinetics of mNeonGreen compared to the commonly used reporter protein, superfolder green fluorescent protein.

        "abstract": "Fc engineering efforts are increasingly being employed to modulate interaction of antibodies with variety of Fc receptors in an effort to improve the efficacy and safety of the therapeutic antibodies. Among the various Fc receptors, Fc gamma receptors (FcγRs) present on variety of immune cells are especially relevant since they can activate multiple effector functions including antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and antibody dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP). Depending on the desired mechanism of action (MOA) of the antibody, interactions between Fc domain of the antibody and FcγR (denoted as Fc/FcγR) may need to be enhanced or abolished. Therefore, during the antibody discovery process, biochemical methods are routinely used to measure the affinities of Fc/FcγR interactions. To enable such screening, we developed a plate based, simple to use, homogeneous immunoassays for six FcγRs by leveraging a luminescent protein complementation technology (NanoBiT). An added advantage of the NanoBiT immunoassays is their solution-based format, which minimizes well known surface related artifacts associated with traditional biosensor platforms (e.g., surface plasmon resonance and biolayer interferometry). With NanoBiT FcγRs assays, we demonstrate that assays are specific, report IgG subclass specific affinities and detect modulation in Fc/FcγR interactions in response to the changes in the Fc domain. We subsequently screen a panel of therapeutic antibodies including seven monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and four polyclonal intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) products and highlight the advantages of parallel screening method for developing new antibody therapies.",

Distinct molecular markers and associated signaling pathways provide valuable insight for CF biology and interventional strategies to influence injury response and aging-associated remodeling. Receptor tyrosine kinase c-Kit mediates cell survival, proliferation, migration, and is activated by pathological injury. However, the biological significance of c-Kit within CF population has not been addressed. An inducible reporter mouse detects c-Kit promoter activation with Enhanced Green Fluorescent Protein (EGFP) expression in cardiac cells. Coincidence of EGFP and c-Kit with the DDR2 fibroblast marker was confirmed using flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry. Subsequently, CFs expressing DDR2 with or without c-Kit was isolated and characterized. A subset of DDR2<sup>+</sup> CFs also express c-Kit with coincidence in ~ 8% of total cardiac interstitial cells (CICs). Aging is associated with decreased number of c-Kit expressing DDR2<sup>+</sup> CFs, whereas pathological injury induces c-Kit and DDR2 as well as the frequency of coincident expression in CICs. scRNA-Seq profiling reveals the transcriptome of c-Kit expressing CFs as cells with transitional phenotype. Cultured cardiac DDR2<sup>+</sup> fibroblasts that are c-Kit<sup>+</sup> exhibit morphological and functional characteristics consistent with youthful phenotypes compared to c-Kit<sup>-</sup> cells. Mechanistically, c-Kit expression correlates with signaling implicated in proliferation and cell migration, including phospho-ERK and pro-caspase 3. The phenotype of c-kit<sup>+</sup> on DDR2<sup>+</sup> CFs correlates with multiple characteristics of 'youthful' cells. To our knowledge, this represents the first evaluation of c-Kit biology within DDR2<sup>+</sup> CF population and provides a fundamental basis for future studies to influence myocardial biology, response to pathological injury and physiological aging.",

For this purpose, a three-microelectrode system with working, counter, and pseudo reference electrodes was blindly implanted into the snail's spinal cord to electrically stimulate (triggering) the action potential with a staircase electrical voltage at a very low frequency level, along with measurement of the electrical current, as a detection system. Under optimum conditions, using the one-factor-at-a-time method, a wide linear range between 1.0 × 10<sup>-14</sup> and 1.0 × 10<sup>-1</sup> mol L<sup>-1</sup> with correlation coefficients (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup>) >0.98 and a response time (<i>t</i><sub>90</sub>) of maximum 10.0 s were approximated. Percentages of relative standard deviation were estimated to be 3.08 (reproducibility, <i>n</i> = 50) and 7.31 (repeatability, <i>n</i> = 15). The detection limit was estimated to be sub 2.1 × 10<sup>-16</sup> mol L<sup>-1</sup> based on the X<sub>b</sub><sup>-</sup> + 3S<sub>b</sub> definition. The reliability of this phenomenon was evidenced by the estimation of recovery percentages (between 95 and 107%) during spiking Hg<sup>2+</sup> standard solutions. The probable mechanism behind this process could be attributed to the following: (i) the neuronal ephaptic coupling during electrical synchronization by a specific brain-triggered wave as a neuronal motor toolkit and (ii) chemical synchronization using a Hg<sup>2+</sup> hypercalcemia actuator (biosensor). Linear correlation has been evidenced during interactions between Hg<sup>2+</sup> and a calcium ionic channel's protein with a gram molecular weight of 66.2 ± 0.3 KCU. This process, therefore, caused an opening of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel gates and majorly released the Ca<sup>2+</sup> (hypercalcemia) that was detected as the main source of the measured electrical current. At this condition, ultratrace levels of Hg<sup>2+</sup> ions not only were considered as nontoxic reagents but also had chemically regulating effects as ephaptic synchronizers to the neuron cells.

The method includes (i) purification of MLuc inclusion bodies, solubilization of the aggregated form with full reduction of disulfide bonds, and refolding to the native state using a glutathione redox system in the presence of arginine and Cu<sup>2+</sup> ions and (ii) chromatographic purification of MLuc and its functional assessment in terms of activity. We introduce the empirical, optimal conditions for oxidative refolding and subsequent purification of MLuc, with its basic properties taken into account. We believe that this protocol is adaptable for a large-scale harvest of other natively folded copepod luciferases as well as other disulfide-rich recombinant proteins from E. coli inclusion bodies.",

These effects involved the increased expression of components of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling and were reverted by a BMP inhibitor noggin. FGF2 also transiently stimulated osteoblast differentiation and the expression of <i>Ibsp</i> and <i>Dmp1</i>. The present study aimed to further explore interactions between BMP and FGF signaling during odontoblast and osteoblast differentiation in DP cultures. Cultures were established using DP tissue isolated from non-transgenic and fluorescent reporter (DSPP-Cerulean, BSP-GFP, and DMP1-mCherry) transgenic mice and exposed to BMP2, FGF2, SU5402 (an FGF receptor inhibitor), and noggin between days 3-7. Mineralization, gene expression, fluorescent protein expression, and odontoblast formation were examined using xylenol orange, quantitative PCR, fluorometric analysis, and immunocytochemistry, respectively. BMP2 activated SMAD1/5/8 but not ERK1/2 signaling, whereas FGF2 exerted opposite effects. BMP2 did not affect mineralization, the expression of <i>Ibsp</i> and <i>Dmp1</i>, and the percentage of DSPP-Cerulean+ odontoblasts but significantly increased <i>Dspp</i> and DSPP-Cerulean. In cultures exposed to BMP2 and FGF2, respectively, both SU5402 and noggin led to long-lasting decreases in <i>Dspp</i> and DSPP-Cerulean and transient decreases in <i>Dmp1</i> and DMP1-mCherry without affecting <i>Ibsp</i> and BSP-GFP. BMP2 and FGF2 exerted reciprocal stimulatory effects on odontoblast differentiation, whereas their effects on osteoblast differentiation were mediated independently. These data will further elucidate the perspectives of using BMP2 and FGF2 for dentin regeneration/repair.",

In rice (Oryza sativa L.), a monocot model plant and a globally important crop, clearing technology has been reported in organs that are relatively easy to observe, such as the roots and leaves. Applications of clearing technology in shoot apical meristem (SAM) and stems have also been reported, but only to a limited degree because of the poor penetration of the clearing solution (CS) in these tissues. The limited efficiency of the clearing solutions in these tissues has been attributed to auto-fluorescence, thickening, and hardening of the tissues in the stem as the vascular bundles and epidermis develop and layering of the SAM with water-repellent leaves. The present protocol reports the optimization of a clearing approach for continuous and 3D observation of gene expression from the SAM/young panicle to the base of the shoots during development. Fixed tissue samples expressing a fluorescent protein reporter were trimmed into sections using a vibrating micro-slicer. When an appropriate thickness was achieved, the CS was applied. By specifically targeting the central tissue, the penetration rate and uniformity of the CS increased, and the time required to make the tissue transparent decreased. Additionally, clearing of the trimmed sections enabled the observation of the internal structure of the whole shoot from a macro perspective. This method has potential applications in deep imaging of tissues of other plant species that are difficult to clear.",

One such defense is the transcriptional silencing of incoming viral DNA, including the silencing of unintegrated retroviral DNA in most cells. Here, we report that the lymphoid cell lines K562 and Jurkat cells reveal a dramatically higher efficiency of silencing of viral expression from unintegrated HIV-1 DNAs as compared to HeLa cells. We found K562 cells in particular to exhibit an extreme silencing phenotype. Infection of K562 cells with a non-integrating viral vector encoding a green fluorescent protein reporter resulted in a striking decrease in the number of fluorescence-positive cells and in their mean fluorescence intensity as compared to integration-competent controls, even though the levels of viral DNA in the nucleus were equal or in the case of 2-LTR circles even higher. The silencing in K562 cells was functionally distinctive. Histones loaded on unintegrated HIV-1 DNA in K562 cells revealed high levels of the silencing mark H3K9 trimethylation and low levels of the active mark H3 acetylation, as detected in HeLa cells. But infection of K562 cells resulted in low H3K27 trimethylation levels on unintegrated viral DNA as compared to higher levels in HeLa cells, corresponding to low H3K27 trimethylation levels of silent host globin genes in K562 cells as compared to HeLa cells. Most surprisingly, treatment with the HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A, which led to a highly efficient relief of silencing in HeLa cells, only weakly relieved silencing in K562 cells. In summary, we found that the capacity for silencing viral DNAs differs between cell lines in its extent, and likely in its mechanism.",

        "abstract": "A recent approach to perform genetic tracing of complex biological problems involves the generation of synthetic deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) probes that specifically mark cells with a phenotype of interest. These synthetic locus control regions (sLCRs), in turn, drive the expression of a reporter gene, such as fluorescent protein. To build functional and specific sLCRs, it is critical to accurately select multiple bona fide cis-regulatory elements from the target cell phenotype cistrome. This selection occurs by maximizing the number and diversity of transcription factors (TFs) within the sLCR, yet the size of the final sLCR should remain limited. In this work, we discuss how optimization, in particular integer programing, can be used to systematically address the construction of a specific sLCR and optimize pre-defined properties of the sLCR. Our presented instance of a linear optimization problem maximizes the activation potential of the sLCR such that its size is limited to a pre-defined length and a minimum number of all TFs deemed sufficiently characteristic for the phenotype of interest is covered. We generated an sLCR to trace the mesenchymal glioblastoma program in patients by solving our corresponding linear program with the software optimizer Gurobi. Considering the binding strength of transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) with their TFs as a proxy for activation potential, the optimized sLCR scores similarly to an sLCR experimentally validated in vivo, and is smaller in size while having the same coverage of TFBSs. We provide a Python implementation of the presented framework in the Supplementary Material with which an optimal selection of cis-regulatory elements can be calculated once the target set of TFs and their binding strength with their TFBSs is known.

A major factor limiting the use of ncAAs is the lack of orthogonal translation systems (OTSs) that support efficient genetic code expansion at repurposed stop codons. Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) have been extensively evolved in <i>Escherichia coli</i> but are not always orthogonal in eukaryotes. In this work, we use a yeast display-based ncAA incorporation reporter platform with fluorescence-activated cell sorting to screen libraries of aaRSs in high throughput for (1) the incorporation of ncAAs not previously encoded in yeast; (2) the improvement of the performance of an existing aaRS; (3) highly selective OTSs capable of discriminating between closely related ncAA analogues; and (4) OTSs exhibiting enhanced polyspecificity to support translation with structurally diverse sets of ncAAs. The number of previously undiscovered aaRS variants we report in this work more than doubles the total number of translationally active aaRSs available for genetic code manipulation in yeast. The success of myriad screening strategies has important implications related to the fundamental properties and evolvability of aaRSs. Furthermore, access to OTSs with diverse activities and specific or polyspecific properties is invaluable for a range of applications within chemical biology, synthetic biology, and protein engineering.",

In particular, VMH neurons are thought to be important for initiating the counterregulatory response to hypoglycemia, and ex vivo electrophysiology and immunohistochemistry data indicate a clear role for VMH neurons in sensing glucose concentration. However, the temporal response of VMH neurons to physiologically relevant changes in glucose availability in vivo has been hampered by a lack of available tools for measuring neuronal activity over time. Since the majority of neurons within the VMH are glutamatergic and can be targeted using the vesicular glutamate transporter Vglut2, we expressed cre-dependent GCaMP7s in Vglut2 cre mice and examined the response profile of VMH to intraperitoneal injections of glucose, insulin, and 2-deoxyglucose (2DG). We show that reduced available glucose via insulin-induced hypoglycemia and 2DG-induced glucoprivation, but not hyperglycemia induced by glucose injection, inhibits VMH Vglut2 neuronal population activity in vivo. Surprisingly, this inhibition was maintained for at least 45 minutes despite prolonged hypoglycemia and initiation of a counterregulatory response. Thus, although VMH stimulation, via pharmacological, electrical, or optogenetic approaches, is sufficient to drive a counterregulatory response, our data suggest VMH Vglut2 neurons are not the main drivers required to do so, since VMH Vglut2 neuronal population activity remains suppressed during hypoglycemia and glucoprivation.",

We engineer a genetic circuit harbouring a genetically encoded sensor, amplifier and actuator in probiotics to restore intestinal bile salt metabolism in response to antibiotic-induced microbiome dysbiosis.

This activity has been studied using electrophysiological approaches, as high temporal resolution is required to recognize SWRs in the neuronal signals. However, it has been difficult to analyze the individual contribution of neurons to task-specific SWRs, because it is hard to track neurons across a long time with electrophysiological recording. In this study, we recorded local field potential (LFP) signals in the hippocampal CA1 of freely behaving mice and simultaneously imaged calcium signals in contralateral CA1 to leverage the advantages of both electrophysiological and imaging approaches. We manufactured a custom-designed microdrive array and targeted tetrodes to the left hippocampus CA1 for LFP recording and applied electrical stimulation in the ventral hippocampal commissure (VHC) for closed-loop disruption of SWRs. Neuronal population imaging in the right hippocampal CA1 was performed using a miniature fluorescent microscope (Miniscope) and a genetically encoded calcium indicator. As SWRs show highly synchronized bilateral occurrence, calcium signals of SWR-participating neurons could be identified and tracked in spontaneous or SWR-disrupted conditions. Using this approach, we identified a subpopulation of CA1 neurons showing synchronous calcium elevation to SWRs. Our results showed that SWR-related calcium transients are more disrupted by electrical stimulation than non-SWRrelated calcium transients, validating the capability of the system to detect and disrupt SWRs. Our dual recording method can be used to uncover the dynamic participation of individual neurons in SWRs and replay over extended time windows.",

However, little is known about the dynamics of these cells because of the difficulty in real-time monitoring of them over long periods of time in vivo. To overcome this limitation, we present a genetically encoded RNA indicator (GERI) mouse for intravital chronic imaging of endogenous <i>Arc</i> messenger RNA (mRNA)-a popular marker for memory trace cells. We used our GERI to identify <i>Arc</i>-positive neurons in real time without the delay associated with reporter protein expression in conventional approaches. We found that the <i>Arc</i>-positive neuronal populations rapidly turned over within 2 d in the hippocampal CA1 region, whereas ∼4% of neurons in the retrosplenial cortex consistently expressed <i>Arc</i> following contextual fear conditioning and repeated memory retrievals. Dual imaging of GERI and a calcium indicator in CA1 of mice navigating a virtual reality environment revealed that only the population of neurons expressing <i>Arc</i> during both encoding and retrieval exhibited relatively high calcium activity in a context-specific manner. This in vivo RNA-imaging approach opens the possibility of unraveling the dynamics of the neuronal population underlying various learning and memory processes.",

        "abstract": "The 3C-like protease (3CLpro) of SARS-CoV-2 is an attractive drug target for developing antivirals against SARS-CoV-2. A few small molecule inhibitors of 3CLpro are in clinical trials for COVID-19 treatments, and more inhibitors are under development. One limiting factor for 3CLpro inhibitors development is that the cellular activities of such inhibitors should be evaluated in Biosafety Level 3 (BSL-3) laboratories. Here, we design DNA-coded biosensors that can be used in BSL-2 laboratories to set up cell-based assays for 3CLpro inhibitor discovery. The biosensors were constructed by linking a green fluorescent protein (GFP2) to the N-terminus and a Renilla luciferase (RLuc8) to the C-terminus of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro, with the linkers derived from the cleavage sequences of 3CLpro. After overexpression of the biosensors in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells, 3CLpro can be released from GFP2 and RLuc by self-cleavage, resulting in a decrease of the bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) signal. Using one of these biosensors, pBRET-10, we evaluated the cellular activities of several 3CLpro inhibitors. These inhibitors restored the BRET signal by blocking the proteolysis of pBRET-10, and their relative activities measured using pBRET-10 were consistent with their previously reported anti-SARS-CoV-2 activities. We conclude that the biosensor pBRET-10 is a useful tool for SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro inhibitor discovery. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> The virus proteases 3CLpro are validated drug targets for developing antivirals to treat coronavirus diseases, such as COVID-19. However, the development of 3CLpro inhibitors relies heavily on BSL-3 laboratories. Here, we report a series of BRET-based self-cleaving biosensors that can be used to set up cell-based assays to evaluate the cell permeability and cellular activity of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro inhibitors in BSL-2 laboratories. The cell-based assay is suitable for high-throughput screening for 3CLpro inhibitors because of the simplicity and good reproducibility of our biosensors. The design strategy can also be used to design biosensors for other viral proteases for which the activation processes involve the self-cleavage of polyproteins.",

Exogenously provided, e.g. transgene encoded, small RNAs could be used to inhibit virus replication, breaking the transmission cycle. We tested, in Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus cell lines, reporter-based strategies for assessing the ability of two types of small RNAs to inhibit a chikungunya virus (CHIKV) derived target. Both types of small RNAs use a Drosophila melanogaster pre-miRNA-1 based hairpin for their expression, either with perfect base-pairing in the stem region (shRNA-like) or containing two mismatches (miRNA-like). The pre-miRNA-1 stem loop structure was encoded within an intron; this allows co-expression of one or more proteins, e.g. a fluorescent protein marker tracking the temporal and spatial expression of the small RNAs in vivo. Three reporter-based systems were used to assess the relative silencing efficiency of ten shRNA-like siRNAs and corresponding miRNA-like designs. Two systems used a luciferase reporter RNA with CHIKV RNA inserted either in the coding sequence or within the 3' UTR. A third reporter used a CHIKV derived split replication system. All three reporters demonstrated that while silencing could be achieved with both miRNA-like and shRNA-like designs, the latter were substantially more effective. Dcr-2 was required for the shRNA-like siRNAs as demonstrated by loss of inhibition of the reporters in Dcr-2 deficient cell lines. These positive results in cell culture are encouraging for the potential use of this pre-miRNA-1-based system in transgenic mosquitoes.",

There is evidence that inhibitory interneurons play a role in this process, but the exact mechanism remains unclear. Glutamate decarboxylase-1 (GAD1) is a protein expressed exclusively in inhibitory interneurons. Transgenic rats encoding GAD1-GCaMP were generated to visualize the activity in GAD1 neurons through genetically encoded calcium indicators (GCaMP6s) in the somatosensory cortex. Forepaw denervation was performed in adult rats, and fluorescent Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging on cortical slices was obtained. Local, intrahemispheric stimulation (cortical layers 2/3 and 5) induced a significantly higher fluorescence change of GAD1-expressing neurons, and a significantly higher number of neurons were responsive to stimulation in the denervated rats compared to control rats. However, remote, interhemispheric stimulation of the corpus callosum induced a significantly lower fluorescence change of GAD1-expressing neurons, and significantly fewer neurons were deemed responsive to stimulation within layer 5 in denervated rats compared to control rats. These results suggest that injury impacts interhemispheric communication, leading to an overall decrease in the activity of inhibitory interneurons in layer 5. Overall, our results provide direct evidence that inhibitory interneuron activity in the deprived S1 is altered after injury, a phenomenon likely to affect sensory processing.",

Detailed understanding of carbohydrate metabolism regulation in this genus is of prime importance and availability of additional genetic tools easing such studies would be beneficial. To develop a fluorescent protein-based reporter system that can be used in B. longum NCC 2705, we first selected the most promising fluorescent protein out of the seven we tested (i.e., mCherry). This reporter protein was then used to study the carbohydrate mediated activation of P<sub>Bl1518</sub> and P<sub>Bl1694</sub>, two promoters respectively predicted to be controlled by the transcriptional factors AraQ and AraU, previously suggested to regulate arabinose utilization and proposed to also act as global transcriptional regulators in bifidobacteria. We confirmed that in B. longum NCC 2705 the AraQ controlled promoter (P<sub>Bl1518</sub>) is induced strongly by arabinose and established that the AraU controlled promoter (P<sub>Bl1694</sub>) was mostly induced by the hexoses galactose and fructose. Combining the mCherry reporter system with flow cytometry, we established that NCC 2705 is able to co-metabolize arabinose and glucose while galactose was only consumed after glucose exhaustion, thus illustrating the complexity of different carbohydrate consumption patterns and their specific regulation in this strain.",

Using imaging flow cytometer (IFC) and confocal microscopy we quantitatively investigated photoinduced AzoTAB-mediated fusion of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine vesicles.

They can notably be designed to follow the production of a target compound or to monitor key cellular properties, such as stress or starvation. In most cases, the biosensors are built with fluorescent protein (FP) genes as reporter genes because of the direct correlation between promoter activity and fluorescence level that can be measured using, for instance, flow cytometry or fluorometry. The expansion of available FPs offers the possibility of using several FPs - and biosensors - in parallel in one host, with simultaneous detection using multicolor flow cytometry. However, the technique is currently limited by the unavailability of combinations of FP whose genes can be successfully expressed in the host and whose fluorescence can be efficiently distinguished from each other. In the present study, the broad collection of available FPs was explored and four different FPs were successfully expressed in the yeast <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>: yEGFP, mEGFP, CyOFP1opt and mBeRFPopt. After studying their fluorescence signals, population heterogeneity and possible interactions, we recommend two original combinations of FPs for bi-color flow cytometry: mEGFP together with either CyOFP1opt or mBeRFPopt, as well as the combination of all three FPs mEGFP, CyOFP1opt and mBeRFPopt for tri-color flow cytometry.

Only two enzymes, OGT (O-GlcNAc transferase) and OGA (O-GlcNAcase), control the attachment and removal of O-GlcNAc on proteins, respectively. Whereas a variant OGT (mOGT) has been proposed as the main isoform that O-GlcNAcylates proteins in mitochondria, identification of a mitochondrial OGA has not been performed yet. Two splice variants of OGA (short and long isoforms) have been described previously. In this work, using cell fractionation experiments, we show that short-OGA is preferentially recovered in mitochondria-enriched fractions from HEK-293T cells and RAW 264.7 cells, as well as mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Moreover, fluorescent microscopy imaging confirmed that GFP-tagged short-OGA is addressed to mitochondria. In addition, using a Bioluminescence Resonance Energy Transfer (BRET)-based mitochondrial O-GlcNAcylation biosensor, we show that co-transfection of short-OGA markedly reduced O-GlcNAcylation of the biosensor, whereas long-OGA had no significant effect. Finally, using genetically encoded or chemical fluorescent mitochondrial probes, we show that short-OGA overexpression increases mitochondrial ROS levels, whereas long-OGA has no significant effect.

Using an siRNA screen, we identify TRPM7 as a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-conducting ion channel essential for phagosome maturation during efferocytosis. Trpm7-targeted macrophages fail to fully acidify or digest their phagosomal cargo in the absence of TRPM7. Through perforated patch electrophysiology, we demonstrate that TRPM7 mediates a pH-activated cationic current necessary to sustain phagosomal acidification. Using mice expressing a genetically-encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor, we observe that phagosome maturation requires peri-phagosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup>-signals dependent on TRPM7.

In this research, we construct a catalytic single-molecule Föster resonance energy transfer (FRET) biosensor for in vitro and in vivo biosensing of UDG activity. Target UDG can remove uracil base from the detection probe and cause the cleavage of detection probe by apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease (APE1), which exposes its toehold domain and initiates catalytic assembly of two fluorescently labeled hairpin probes via toehold-meditated strand displacement reaction (SDA) to generate abundant DNA duplexes with amplified FRET signal. In this assay, target UDG signal is amplified via enzyme-free catalytic reaction and the whole reaction may be completed in one step, which greatly simplifies the assay procedure, reduces the assay time, and facilitates the cellular imaging. This biosensor enables specific and sensitive measurement of UDG down to 0.00029 U/mL, and it is suitable for analyzing kinetic parameters, screening inhibitors, and even imaging endogenous UDG in live cells.

AI-2 can trigger enhanced colonisation and biofilm formation, and this poses a serious risk to public health. To date, this communication system of C. jejuni is only partially understood, as detection and quantification of such autoinducer signalling molecules in complex media is hard to achieve. We have developed a whole-cell Vibrioharveyi-based biosensor assay to accurately quantify and follow production of AI-2 by C. jejuni 81-176 in a defined growth medium and in a model food system. Several V. harveyi strains were tested, but the most sensitive bioluminescent response to C. jejuni AI-2 was achieved with V. harveyi MM30, likely due to its ability to self-amplify the response to AI-2. The AI-2 concentrations measured by this biosensor were confirmed using an independent analytical method, HPLC-FLD, which we introduced for Campylobacter analytics for the first time. The AI-2 concentration produced by C. jejuni 81-176 in the model food system was ∼5-fold that in the defined growth medium, at the same cell density. Together with the linear increments in AI-2 concentrations with cell density, this suggests that in C. jejuni, AI-2 represents a metabolic by-product rather than a true quorum-sensing molecule. This biosensor method is highly sensitive, as shown by the reduction in the limit of detection (by a factor of 100) compared to HPLC-FLD, and it enables quantification of AI-2 in complex matrices, such as food, which will help to improve the quality and safety of food production.",

Recently, nanobody Rh57 specific binding with GTP bound active RhoA was discovered and developed as a BRET biosensor without cytotoxicity. To further clarify the nanobody Rh57's mechanism of action, we co-expressed, purified, and crystallized the RhoA-Rh57 nanobody complex and solved the structure by X-ray diffraction with a resolution of 2.76 Å. The structure showed that the interaction is mainly through hydrogen bonds, salt bridges, aromatic-aromatic interactions, and hydrophobic interactions. The involved regions include CDR3 and non-hypervariable loop of Rh57, and the SWI switch loops of RhoA, respectively. The different SWI conformation of inactivated RhoA-GDP prevented the Rh57's binding. The possible explanation of Rh57 as a non-cytotoxic BRET intracellular tracer is that Rh57's binding did not overlap with downstream PRK1 and thus did not interfere with the downstream signaling pathway.

The tight balance between these two signals dictates the cellular response to changing light conditions. While the role of reductive signals in activating chloroplast metabolism is well established, the role of their counterbalanced oxidative signals is still unclear, mainly due to monitoring difficulties. Here, we introduced chl-roGFP2-PrxΔCR, a 2-Cys peroxiredoxin-based biosensor, into Arabidopsis thaliana chloroplasts to monitor the dynamic changes in photosynthetically derived oxidative signaling. We showed that chl-roGFP2-PrxΔCR oxidation states reflected oxidation patterns similar to those of endogenous 2-Cys peroxiredoxin under varying light conditions. By employing a set of genetically encoded biosensors, we showed the induction of 2-Cys peroxiredoxin-dependent oxidative signals, throughout the day, under varying light intensities and their inverse relationship with NADPH levels, unraveling the combined activity of reducing and oxidizing signals. Furthermore, we demonstrated the induction of 2-Cys peroxiredoxin-derived oxidative signals during a dark–to–low-light transition and uncovered a faster increase in carbon assimilation rates during the photosynthesis induction phase in plants deficient in 2-Cys peroxiredoxins compared with wild type, suggesting the involvement of oxidative signals in attenuating photosynthesis. The presented data highlight the role of oxidative signals under nonstress conditions and suggest that oxidative signals measured by peroxiredoxin-based biosensors reflect the limitation to photosynthesis imposed by the redox regulatory system.",

        "abstract": "The more we understand the strategies used by viruses for protein expression, the more possibilities we have to exploit viruses as expression vectors for heterologous protein production. Advances in the development of virus-based expression systems have been possible due to generation of many virus infectious clones, especially those derived from plant viruses, which have the capability for rapid and high-level transient expression of proteins in plant cells, a robust and low-cost bioreactor. In this work, we generated new replicative virus expression vectors based on a previously constructed citrus sudden death-associated virus (CSDaV) infectious cDNA clone. These vectors were generated to express the reporter green fluorescent protein (GFP) in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> leaves by taking advantage of the expression strategies used by CSDaV to produce its structural proteins. We show that higher amounts of GFP can be produced from a coat protein (CP)-independent CSDaV-based vector, compared to levels of GFP expressed from a widely used non-replicative vector (pEAQ series); or GFP can be produced in fusion with the major CSDaV CP (CPp21) to be incorporated into chimeric virions. However, GFP-recombinant CSDaV virions do not appear uniformly assembled, but more likely as mosaic particles. Cryo-electron microscopy analysis from this work revealed the structures of the wild-type and the GFP-recombinant CSDaV virions, but it was not able to reveal where exactly the GFP is displayed in the chimeric virions. We show though that the incorporation of GFP-CPp21 fusion protein into virions occurs solely due to its interaction with free/non-fused CPp21, independent of other viral proteins. Therefore, individual co-expression of GFP-CPp21 and CPp21 in the same plant cells leads to the production of chimeric virus-like particles (VLPs), while GFP-CPp21 fusion protein itself is not able to self-assemble into VLPs. The new CSDaV-based expression vectors may provide an alternative platform for use in molecular farming, either for production of heterologous proteins or as scaffold for heterologous protein display.",

        "abstract": "Ebola virus (EBOV) causes hemorrhagic fever in humans with high case fatality rates. In the past, a number of recombinant EBOVs expressing different reporters from additional transcription units or as fusion proteins have been rescued. These viruses are important tools for the study of EBOV, and their uses include high throughput screening approaches, the analysis of intercellular localization of viral proteins and of tissue distribution of viruses, and the study of pathogenesis in vivo. However, they all show, at least in vivo, attenuation compared to wild type virus, and the basis of this attenuation is only poorly understood. Unfortunately, rescue of these viruses is a lengthy and not always successful process, and working with them is restricted to biosafety level (BSL)-4 laboratories, so that the search for non-attenuated reporter-expressing EBOVs remains challenging. However, several life cycle modeling systems have been developed to mimic different aspects of the filovirus life cycle under BSL-1 or -2 conditions, but it remains unclear whether these systems can be used to predict the viability and possible attenuation of recombinant EBOVs. To address this question, we systematically fused N- or C-terminally either a flag-HA tag or a green fluorescent protein (GFP) to different EBOV proteins, and analyzed the impact of these additions with respect to protein function in life cycle modeling systems. Based on these results, selected recombinant EBOVs encoding these tags/proteins were then rescued and characterized for a possible attenuation in vitro, and results compared with data from the life cycle modeling systems. While the results for the small molecular tags showed mostly good concordance, GFP-expressing viruses were more attenuated than expected based on the results from the life cycle modeling system, demonstrating a limitation of these systems and emphasizing the importance of work with infectious virus. Nevertheless, life cycle modeling system remain useful tools to exclude non-viable tagging strategies.",

To study the potential roles VZVsncRNA 10-13 have in neuronal infection we generated two recombinant VZV; one in which 8 nucleotides were changed in VZVsncRNA10 without altering the encoded residues of ORF61 (VZVsnc10MUT) and a second containing a 12-nucleotide deletion of the sequence common to VZVsncRNA12 and 13, located in the ORF61 mRNA leader sequence (VZVsnc12-13DEL). Both were developed from a VZV BAC with a green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter fused to the N terminal of the capsid protein encoded by ORF23. The growth of both mutant VZV in epithelial cells and fibroblasts was similar to that of the parental recombinant virus. Both mutants established productive infections and experimental latency in neurons derived from human embryonic stem cells (hESC). However, neurons that were latently infected with both VZV mutant viruses showed impaired ability to reactivate when given stimuli that successfully reactivated the parental virus. These results suggest that these VZVsncRNA may have a role in VZV latency maintenance and/or reactivation.

Lastly, we showed that expression of the reporter genes, N gene, gRNA, and sgRNA from the replicon was sensitive to inhibition by Remdesivir.

Recently, bioenergetics has become a new paradigm for anti-TB drug discovery and is based on the link between bacterial ATP levels and drug efficacy. A better understanding of the role of ATP fluctuations during antibiotic treatment may provide insight into antibiotic-mediated killing of mycobacteria. Here, we employed an advanced single-fluorescence FRET (fluorescence resonance energy transfer)-based ATP biosensor, ATPser, for the stable and convenient detection of intracellular ATP fluctuations in mycobacteria. This strategy correlated closely with the results obtained from conventional luminescence ATP assays, indicating the reliability of the system for bioenergetics analysis in mycobacteria. Moreover, the reporter strains expressing ATPser displayed obvious ATP changes when subjected to different stresses, such as starvation and ATP depletion. Interestingly, we observed that different antibiotics induced fluctuations in cellular ATP levels in individual cells of various magnitudes, revealing a strong connection between ATP fluctuations and drug efficacy. Furthermore, drug combinations accelerated ATP perturbation, resulting in increased cell death. We concluded that ATPser enabled real-time measurement of ATP at the single-cell level in mycobacteria, and monitoring ATP dynamics in drug-treated bacteria may shed light on novel treatment strategies. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Bioenergetics has emerged as a new paradigm for antituberculosis (anti-TB) drug discovery, and the cellular ATP level is the core indicator reflecting bacterial metabolic homeostasis. Although several bulk assays have been designed for the measurement of cellular ATP content, a more convenient strategy is required for real-time ATP measurement of single viable cells. In this study, by combining the ε-subunit of Bacillus subtilis F<sub>o</sub>F<sub>1</sub>-ATP synthase with a circularly permuted green fluorescent protein [(cp)GFP], we constructed a FRET-based single-fluorescence ATP sensor, ATPser, for real-time single-cell ATP detection among a mycobacterial population. Using the ATPser, we designed different drug combinations containing components that have similar/opposite effects on ATP alternation. Our results demonstrated that increased cellular ATP fluctuations were associated with depletion of mycobacterial viability, while counteracting ATP fluctuations weakened the killing effect of the drug regime. Thus, potentially efficient drug combinations can be considered based on their similar effects on mycobacterial ATP levels, and ATPser may be a useful tool to study mycobacterial bioenergetics and to guide drug regime design.",

We recently introduced a novel method for enzyme thermostabilization that relies on the computationally guided installation of genetically encoded thioether \"staples\" into a protein via cysteine alkylation with the noncanonical amino acid <i>O</i>-2-bromoethyl tyrosine (O2beY). Here, we demonstrate the functionality of an expanded set of electrophilic amino acids featuring chloroacetamido, acrylamido, and vinylsulfonamido side-chain groups for protein stapling using this strategy. Using a myoglobin-based cyclopropanase as a model enzyme, our studies show that covalent stapling with <i>p</i>-chloroacetamido-phenylalanine (pCaaF) provides higher stapling efficiency and enhanced stability (thermodynamic and kinetic) compared to the other stapled variants and the parent protein. Interestingly, molecular simulations of conformational flexibility of the cross-links show that the pCaaF staple allows fewer energetically feasible conformers than the other staples, and this property may be a broader indicator of stability enhancement. Using this strategy, pCaaF-stapled variants with significantly enhanced stability against thermal denaturation (Δ<i>T</i><sub>m</sub>' = +27 °C) and temperature-induced heme loss (Δ<i>T</i><sub>50</sub> = +30 °C) were obtained while maintaining high levels of catalytic activity and stereoselectivity.

Bioluminescent sensor proteins provide an attractive alternative to fluorescent sensors for these applications, but the only bioluminescent sensor protein developed so far, BLZinCh, has a limited sensor response and a suboptimal Zn<sup>2+</sup> affinity. In this work, we expanded the toolbox of bioluminescent Zn<sup>2+</sup> sensors by developing two new sensor families that show a large change in the emission ratio and cover a range of physiologically relevant Zn<sup>2+</sup> affinities. The LuZi platform relies on competitive complementation of split NanoLuc luciferase and displays a robust, 2-fold change in red-to-blue emission, allowing quantification of free Zn<sup>2+</sup> between 2 pM and 1 nM. The second platform was developed by replacing the long flexible GGS linker in the original BLZinCh sensor by rigid polyproline linkers, yielding a series of BLZinCh-Pro sensors with a 3-4-fold improved ratiometric response and physiologically relevant Zn<sup>2+</sup> affinities between 0.5 and 1 nM. Both the LuZi and BLZinCh-Pro sensors allowed the direct determination of low nM concentrations of free Zn<sup>2+</sup> in serum, providing an attractive alternative to more laborious and/or indirect approaches to measure serum zinc levels. Furthermore, the genetic encoding of the BLZinCh-Pro sensors allowed their use as intracellular sensors, where the sensor occupancy of 40-50% makes them ideally suited to monitor both increases and decreases in intracellular free Zn<sup>2+</sup> concentration in simple, plate reader-based measurements, without the need for fluorescence microscopy.",

        "abstract": "Circadian rhythms are daily oscillations in physiology and gene expression that are governed by a molecular feedback loop known as the circadian clock. In Drosophila melanogaster, the core clock consists of transcription factors clock (Clk) and cycle (cyc) which form protein heterodimers that activate transcription of their repressors, period (per) and timeless (tim). Once produced, protein heterodimers of per/tim repress Clk/cyc activity. One cycle of activation and repression takes approximately (\"circa\") 24-h (\"diem\") and repeats even in the absence of external stimuli. The circadian clock is active in many cells throughout the body; however, tracking it dynamically represents a challenge. Traditional fluorescent reporters are slowly degraded and consequently cannot be used to assess dynamic temporal changes exhibited by the circadian clock. The use of rapidly degraded fluorescent protein reporters containing destabilized GFP (dGFP) that report transcriptional activity in vivo at a single-cell level with ~1-h temporal resolution can circumvent this problem. Here we describe the use of circadian clock reporter strains of Drosophila melanogaster, Clock<sup>PER</sup> and Clock<sup>TIM</sup>, to track clock transcriptional activity using the intestine as a tissue of interest.

To circumvent the poor efficiency of pH measurements below pH 5, we designed three genetically encoded sensors composed of two fluorescent proteins in tandem. We selected fluorescent protein pairs of low but sufficiently different pKa so that each protein could differentially sense the imposed pH. The generated tandems, named Acidin2, Acidin3, and Acidin4, were produced in Escherichia coli and extensively characterized. Altogether, these generated tandems cover a pH range of 3-8. The Acidins were targeted either for release in the apoplast (Apo) or for anchoring at the outer face of the plasma membrane (PM-Apo), with the fluorescent part exposed in the apoplast. Apoplastic Acidins in stably transformed Arabidopsis thaliana primary roots responded immediately and reversibly to pH changes, directly reporting physiological conditions related to cell elongation.

The enzyme β-galactosidase is essential for the lactose metabolism and the growth of this species. Streptococcus thermophilus appears to be a promising cell factory. Food-grade vectors have advantages in heterologous protein expression. This study aimed to determine whether the β-galactosidase of S. thermophilus has the α-complementary characteristic and to develop a novel food-grade vector based on this phenomenon. The N-terminal 7 to 36 AA residues of the β-galactosidase in S. thermophilus were deleted. The obtained mutant S. thermophilus Δα lost β-galactosidase activity and growth ability in the lactose medium. Subsequently, plasmids expressing α-fragments with different lengths of 1 to 36 (Sα1), 1 to 53 (Sα2), and 1 to 88 (Sα3) AA were constructed and transformed into S. thermophilus Δα. Recombinant S. thermophilus Δα expressing Sα2 or Sα3 recovered the ability to grow in the lactose medium, and their β-galactosidase activity accounted for 24.5% or 11.5% of the wild strain, respectively. These results indicated that the α-complementation system of β-galactosidase existed in S. thermophilus. Based on the characteristic, a food-grade vector pSEα was constructed. Except for Sα2, vector pSEα expressed the α-donor derived from E. coli β-galactosidase. This facilitated the construction of recombinant plasmids in E. coli DH5α and thus improved the transformation efficiency of S. thermophilus. Green fluorescent protein as a reporter protein could be highly expressed in S. thermophilus using this vector. As a result, pSEα is an efficient and safe vector for S. thermophilus with potential food applications.",

The pollution of endocrine disruptors (EDCs)in Taihu Lake has been increasing recently, the accurate determination is an important guide for predicting its health risks and developing appropriate controls. Monitoring organic pollutants in water using the diffusive gradient in thin film technique (DGT) has attracted much attention due to more accuracy and convenience than the grab sampling methods. In this study, a novel cyclodextrin polymer (CDP) synthesized by the simple and green method in water was taken as an adsorbent for the binding gel. Four endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs), bisphenol A (BPA), 17α-ethinylestradiol (EE2), 17β-estradiol (E2), and estriol (E3), were taken as models to determine the diffusion coefficients (4.68 × 10<sup>-6</sup>, 3.38 × 10<sup>-6</sup>, 3.34 × 10<sup>-6</sup> and 4.31 × 10<sup>-6</sup> cm<sup>2</sup>/s) and to test the performance of DGT, such as adsorption capacity and deployment time (1-5 day). The assembled CDP-DGT was adopted to determine four EDCs in a simulated water environment (3-9 of pH, 0.001-0.5 M of ionic strength (IS), and dissolved organic matter (DOM) of 0-20 mg/L). The ability of CDP-DGT sampling was verified in the Jiuxiang River and was carried out for a large-scale field application of in situ sampling EDCs in Taihu Lake basin. The results show that the total EDCs concentration range and the estradiol equivalent concentrations (EEQ) in Taihu Lake and its main rivers are 2.78 ng/L to 11.08 ng/L and 2.62 ng/L to 10.91 ng/L, respectively. The risk quotients (RQs) of all sampling sites in the region were greater than 1, indicating that EDCs pose a serious threat to aquatic organisms in the area.

The detection is based on monitoring the luminescent responses of the bacteria panel to changes in the VOC profile following inoculation. First, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was used to specify the differences between the VOC patterns of the inoculated and non-inoculated potato tubers during early infection. Five VOCs were identified, 1-octanol, phenylethyl alcohol, 2-ethyl hexanol, nonanal, and 1-octen-3-ol. Then, the infection was detected by the bioreporter bacterial panel, firstly measured in a 96-well plate in solution, and then also tested in potato plugs and validated in whole tubers. Examination of the bacterial panel responses showed an extensive cytotoxic effect over the testing period, as seen by the elevated induction factor (IF) values in the bacterial strain TV1061 after exposure to both potato plugs and whole tubers. Moreover, quorum sensing influences were also observed by the elevated IF values in the bacterial strain K802NR.

At acidic pH (pH < 5.5), Al<sup>3+</sup> ions are the main form of Al present in the media. Al<sup>3+</sup> ions have an increased solubility at pH < 5.5 and result in plant toxicity. At higher pH, the free Al<sup>3+</sup> fraction decreases in the media, but whether plants can detect Al at these pHs remain unknown. To cope with Al stress, the SENSITIVE TO PROTON RHIZOTOXICITY1 (STOP1) transcription factor induces <i>AL-ACTIVATED MALATE TRANSPORTER1</i> (<i>ALMT1</i>), a malate-exuding transporter as a strategy to chelate the toxic ions in the rhizosphere. Here, we uncoupled the Al signalling pathway that controls STOP1 from Al toxicity using wild type (WT) and two <i>stop1</i> mutants carrying the <i>pALMT1:GUS</i> construct with an agar powder naturally containing low amounts of phosphate, iron (Fe), and Al. We combined gene expression [real-time PCR (RT-PCR) and the <i>pALMT1:GUS</i> reporter], confocal microscopy (<i>pSTOP1:GFP-STOP1</i> reporter), and root growth measurement to assess the effects of Al and Fe on the STOP1-ALMT1 pathway in roots. Our results show that Al triggers STOP1 signaling at a concentration as little as 2 μM and can be detected at a pH above 6.0. We observed that at pH 5.7, 20 μM AlCl<sub>3</sub> induces <i>ALMT1</i> in WT but does not inhibit root growth in <i>stop1</i> Al-hypersensitive mutants. Increasing AlCl<sub>3</sub> concentration (>50 μM) at pH 5.7 results in the inhibition of the <i>stop1</i> mutants primary root. Using the green fluorescent protein (GFP)-STOP1 and <i>ALMT1</i> reporters, we show that the Al signal pathway can be uncoupled from the Al toxicity on the root. Furthermore, we observe that Al strengthens the Fe-mediated inhibition of primary root growth in WT, suggesting an interaction between Fe and Al on the STOP1-ALMT1 pathway.",

Additionally, abundant eGFP-positive photoreceptors were enriched by fluorescence-activated cell sorting, and their transcriptome signatures were revealed by RNA sequencing and data analysis. Moreover, potential clusters of differentiation (CD) biomarkers were extracted for the enrichment of photoreceptors for clinical applications, such as CD133 for the positive selection of photoreceptors. Altogether, the RCVRN-eGFP reporter hiPSC line was successfully established and the first global expression database of recoverin-positive photoreceptors was constructed.

Cell-free ncAA incorporation is of particular interest due to the open nature of cell-free systems and their concurrent ease of manipulation. In this study, we report a straightforward workflow to inquire ncAA positions in regard to incorporation efficiency and protein functionality in a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell-free system. As a model, the well-established orthogonal translation components <i>Escherichia coli</i> tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase (TyrRS) and tRNATyr<sub>CUA</sub> were used to site-specifically incorporate the ncAA p-azido-l-phenylalanine (AzF) in response to UAG codons.

        "abstract": "<b>Purpose:</b> With the increasing detection rate of early prostate cancer (PCa), the proportion of surgical treatment is increasing. Surgery is the most effective treatment for PCa. Precise targeting of tumors during surgery can reduce the incidence of positive surgical margins (PSMs) and preserve the neurovascular bundles (NVBs) as much as possible. The objective of this study was to synthesize a PSMA fluorescent probe (PSMA-Cy5) and verify the targeting specificity of the probe for prostate cancer, thereby providing a theoretical basis for the development of PSMA fluorescent probes for clinical application in the future. <b>Methods:</b> In this study, a novel water-soluble 3H-indocyanine-type bioluminescent dye-Cy5-labeled prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) ligand (PSMA-Cy5) was synthesized by liquid phase synthesis. The PSMA ligand was developed based on the glutamine-urea-lysine (Glu-urea-Lys) structure. The new fluorescent probe was evaluated in vitro and in vivo, and its safety was evaluated. Confocal microscopy was used to observe the binding uptake of PSMA-Cy5 with PSMA (+) LNCaP cells, PSMA (-) PC3 cells and blocked LNCaP cells. In in vivo optical imaging studies, the targeting specificity of PSMA (+) 22Rv1 tumors to probe binding was validated by tail vein injection of PSMA-Cy5. The safety of the PSMA-Cy5 probe was evaluated by histopathological analysis of mouse organs by a single high-dose tail vein injection of PSMA-Cy5. <b>Results:</b> In vitro fluorescence cell uptake experiments showed that the binding of PSMA-Cy5 to LNCaP cells has targeting specificity. PC3 cells and blocked LNCaP cells showed almost no uptake. The results of in vivo optical imaging studies showed that the tumor-to-background ratio in the 22Rv1 group was 3.39 ± 0.47; in the 22Rv1 blocking group it was 0.78 ± 0.15, and in the PC3 group it was 0.94 ± 0.09, consistent with the in vitro results. After a high-dose injection of PSMA-Cy5, there were no abnormalities in the tissues or organs of the mice. The probe showed good safety. <b>Conclusions:</b> PSMA-Cy5 is a probe with good targeting specificity and low toxicity that can accurately visualize tumors in vivo. This study has an important reference value for the development of PSMA fluorescent probes. In the future, it can be applied to precise tumor imaging during radical prostatectomy to reduce the incidence of postoperative PSM.",

        "abstract": "The emergence of efficient viral vectors derived from adeno-associated viruses (AAV) has led many groups to develop gene therapies for inherited monogenic diseases, such as retinal dystrophies. To evaluate the potency of new gene therapy vectors in a preclinical context, it is common to use animal models, such as gene-deficient or mutant animal models of a given human disease, and then assess vision restoration with functional or behavioral assays. While such animal models are invaluable to the preclinical testing process, they cannot be readily used as batch release tests during manufacturing or to validate biological activity at later stages of development. There is therefore a need for rapid and reliable in vitro models that can determine whether therapeutic vectors have delivered their cargo gene, and more importantly, whether this has resulted in the intended biological activity. Given our previous experience, we chose CNGA3-linked achromatopsia to develop a cell-based system to verify biological activity of AAV vectors designed to deliver a healthy <i>CNGA3</i> gene copy into human cone photoreceptors. Our system is based on an immortalized cell line with high susceptibility to AAV transduction, i.e., HeLa cells, which we engineered to express a fungal rhodopsin guanylyl cyclase (RhGC) from <i>Blastocladiella emersonii</i> and a sensitive genetically encoded calcium indicator (GECI) under the control of a tetracycline operator. Using this system, we were able to confirm and quantify the function of the ion channel encoded by AAV/CNGA3 and differentiate between AAV vector potencies with a simple fluorometric assay.

        "abstract": "The serine/threonine protein kinase Akt integrates diverse upstream inputs to regulate cell survival, growth, metabolism, migration, and differentiation. Mounting evidence suggests that Akt activity is differentially regulated depending on its subcellular location, which can include the plasma membrane, endomembrane, and nuclear compartment. This spatial control of Akt activity is critical for achieving signaling specificity and proper physiological functions, and deregulation of compartment-specific Akt signaling is implicated in various diseases, including cancer and diabetes. Understanding the spatial coordination of the signaling network centered around this key kinase and the underlying regulatory mechanisms requires precise tracking of Akt activity at distinct subcellular compartments within its native biological contexts. To address this challenge, new molecular tools are being developed, enabling us to directly interrogate the spatiotemporal regulation of Akt in living cells. These include, for instance, the newly developed genetically encodable fluorescent-protein-based Akt kinase activity reporter (AktAR2), which serves as a substrate surrogate of Akt kinase and translates Akt-specific phosphorylation into a quantifiable change in Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET). In addition, we developed the Akt substrate tandem occupancy peptide sponge (Akt-STOPS), which allows biochemical perturbation of subcellular Akt activity. Both molecular tools can be readily targeted to distinct subcellular localizations. Here, we describe a workflow to study Akt kinase activity at different subcellular locations in living cells. We provide a protocol for using genetically targeted AktAR2 and Akt-STOPS, along with fluorescence imaging in living NIH3T3 cells, to visualize and perturb, respectively, the activity of endogenous Akt kinase at different subcellular compartments. We further describe a protocol for using chemically inducible dimerization (CID) to control the plasma membrane-specific inhibition of Akt activity in real time. Lastly, we describe a protocol for maintaining NIH3T3 cells in culture, a cell line known to exhibit robust Akt activity. In all, this approach enables interrogation of spatiotemporal regulation and functions of Akt, as well as the intricate signaling networks in which it is embedded, at specific subcellular locations. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

        "abstract": "Genetic networks regulate nearly all biological processes, including cellular differentiation, homeostasis, and immune responses. Determining the precise role of each gene within a regulatory network can explain its overall, integrated function, and pinpoint mechanisms underlying misregulation in disease states. Transcriptional reporter assays are a useful tool for dissecting these genetic networks, because they link a molecular process to a measurable readout, such as the expression of a fluorescent protein. Here, we introduce a new technique that uses expressed RNA barcodes as reporters, to measure transcriptional changes induced by CRISPRi-mediated genetic perturbation across a diverse, genome-wide library of guide RNAs. We describe an exemplary reporter based on the promoter that drives His4 expression in these guidelines, which can be used as a framework to interrogate other expression phenotypes. In this workflow, a library of plasmids is assembled, encoding a CRISPRi guide RNA (gRNA) along with one or more transcriptional reporters that drive expression of guide-specific nucleotide barcode sequences. For example, when interrogating regulation of the budding yeast <i>HIS4</i> promoter normalized against a control housekeeping promoter that drives Pgk1 expression, this plasmid library contains a gRNA expression cassette, a <i>HIS4</i> reporter driving expression of one gRNA-specific nucleotide barcode, and a <i>PGK1</i> reporter driving expression of a second, gRNA-specific barcode. Long-read sequencing is used to determine which gRNA is associated with these nucleotide barcodes. The plasmid library is then transformed into yeast cells, where each cell receives one plasmid, and experiences a genetic perturbation driven by the guide on that plasmid. The expressed RNA barcodes are extracted in bulk and quantified using high-throughput sequencing, thereby measuring the effect of their corresponding gRNA on barcoded reporter expression. In the case of the <i>HIS4</i> reporter described above, guides disrupting translation elongation will increase expression of the associated <i>HIS4</i> barcode specifically, without changing expression of the <i>PGK1</i> control barcode. It is further possible to quantify plasmid abundance by DNA sequencing, as an additional approach to normalize for differences in plasmid abundance within the population of cells. This protocol outlines the steps to prepare barcode reporter CRISPRi plasmid libraries, link guides to barcodes with long-read sequencing, and measure expression changes through barcode RNA and DNA sequencing. This method is ideal for probing transcriptional or post-transcriptional regulation, as it measures the effects of a genetic perturbation by directly quantifying reporter RNA abundance, rather than relying on indirect growth or fluorescence readouts.

In agreement with the essential role of VP2 in viral replication, studies with EV71 reporter viruses with wild-type VP2 (enhanced green fluorescent protein [EGFP]-EV71) and a K69R mutant VP2 (EGFP-EV71-VP2 K69R) showed that abolishment of VP2 neddylation increased EV71 replication. In support of this finding, overexpression of NEDD8 significantly inhibited the replication of wild-type EV71 and EGFP-EV71, but not EGFP-EV71-VP2 K69R, whereas pharmacologic inhibition of neddylation with the NEDD8-activating enzyme inhibitor MLN4924 promoted the replication of EV71 in biologically relevant cell types. Our results thus support the notion that EV71 replication can be negatively regulated by host cellular and pathobiological cues through neddylation of VP2 protein. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Neddylation is a ubiquitin-like posttranslational modification by conjugation of neural precursor cell-expressed developmentally downregulated protein 8 (NEDD8) to specific proteins for regulation of their metabolism and biological activities. In this study, we demonstrated for the first time that EV71 VP2 protein is neddylated at K69 residue to promote viral protein degradation and consequentially suppress multiplication of the virus. Our findings advance knowledge related to the roles of VP2 in EV71 virulence and the neddylation pathway in the host restriction of EV71 infection.",

Benzophenones are reported to induce changes in nucleic acids upon UV-irradiation. These alterations may potentially lead to DNA mutation, cell apoptosis, and eventually skin cancer. This work compares the kinetics of the induced DNA damage by some SSs after UV-irradiation. Six commonly used SSs; 4-t-butyl-4-methoxy dibenzoyl methane, 4-methoxycinnamic acid, 2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzophenone (BZ-3), Dibenzoyl methane, 2,2'-dihydroxy-4-methoxy benzophenone (BZ-8) and p-methylbenzoic acid; are investigated. In this work, terbium chloride bioluminescent genosensor is used for sensitive, simple and inexpensive determination of induced DNA-damage. Results reveal that only BZ-3 and BZ-8 induced DNA-damage upon UV-irradiation that are confirmed by both absorption spectroscopy and viscosity measurements. Moreover, viscosity studies indicated the possible intercalation of the SS into DNA prior to initiation of DNA damage. Furthermore, the potency of BZ-3 and BZ-8 to induce DNA damage upon UVA irradiation was assessed on calf thymus DNA. The low cost of the proposed bioluminescent genosensor allows it to be an automatic simple process for the investigation of any DNA-drug interactions without the need of coupling with other analytical methods.",

Most bacterial biosensors were initially designed to detect specific heavy metals such as mercury and cadmium. However, most available biosensors failed to distinguish cadmium from various heavy metals, especially mercury. Integrating diverse sensing elements into a single genetic construct or a single host strain has been demonstrated to quantify several heavy metals simultaneously. In this study, a dual-sensing construct was assembled by employing mercury-responsive regulator (MerR) and cadmium-responsive regulator (CadR) as the separate sensory elements and enhanced fluorescent protein (eGFP) and mCherry red fluorescent protein (mCherry) as the separate reporters. Compared with two corresponding single-sensing bacterial sensors, the dual-sensing bacterial sensor emitted differential double-color fluorescence upon exposure to 0-40 μM toxic Hg(II) and red fluorescence upon exposure to toxic Cd(II) below 200 μM. Bioavailable Hg(II) could be quantitatively determined using double-color fluorescence within a narrow concentration range (0-5 μM). But bioavailable Cd(II) could be quantitatively measured using red fluorescence over a wide concentration range (0-200 μM). The dual-sensing biosensor was applied to detect bioavailable Hg(II) and Cd(II) simultaneously. Significant higher red fluorescence reflected the predominant pollution of Cd(II), and significant higher green fluorescence suggested the predominant pollution of Hg(II). Our findings show that the synergistic application of various sensory modules contributes to an efficient biological device that responds to concurrent heavy metal pollutants in the environment.",

As well as environmental conditions, genetics, and numbers of cell divisions, a major factor influencing cell characteristics is cell age.

We developed a binding process for visualizing the bud scars of <i>Saccharomyces pastorianus</i> var. <i>carlsbergensis</i> using a protein linker containing a polyhistidine tag, a superfolder green fluorescent protein (sfGFP), and a chitin-binding domain (His6-SUMO-sfGFP-ChBD).

The His6-SUMO-sfGFP-ChBD protein was synthesized in <i>Escherichia coli</i>, purified using two-stage chromatography, and checked for monodispersity and purity. Linker-cell binding and the characteristics of the bound complex were determined using flow cytometry and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). Flow cytometry showed that protein binding increased to 60 455 ± 2706 fluorescence units per cell. The specific coupling of the linker to yeast cells was additionally verified by CLSM and adsorption isotherms using yeast cells, <i>E. coli</i> cells, and chitin resin. We found a relationship between the median bud scar number, the median of the fluorescence units, and the chitin content of yeast cells.

In this study, we successfully expressed a bifunctional protein by fusing green fluorescent protein and cellular wall-binding domain of bacteriophage P108. The bifunctional protein can be employed as a signal probe for broad-spectrum fluorimetry of MRSA strains because it can both bind with the target pathogen and emit intensive fluorescence.

Herein, we introduce a Companion-Probe & Race (CPR) platform that enables interrogating nuclear proteins in living cells, while guiding and tracking cellular behaviors (e.g., migration) in real time. The Companion-Probe consists of two polypeptide complexes that were structured with nuclear localization signal (NLS) for entering nucleus, recognition polypeptide for targeting different sites of nuclear proteins, and fragments of green fluorescent protein (GFP) that can recover a whole fluorescent GFP once the two polypeptide complexes combine with a same target protein. The two polypeptide complexes were expressed by two plasmids (named \"probe plasmids\") that were uniformly and efficiently delivered into cells by nano-electroporation (NEP), a high-performance delivery method for cell focal-poration and accelerated intracellular delivery. To track cell migration, multiple radial microchannels were designed with micro-landmarks on the platform to serve as addressable runways for cells. The proof-of-concept of CPR platform was validated with clinical primary cells that indicated the positive-correlation between nuclear protein murine double minute 2 (MDM2) expression level and cell migration velocity.

We have previously established a reporter mismatch plasmid to evaluate MMR using fluorescent proteins in living cells. However, the preparation of these plasmids requires significant amounts of time and money, which reduces their broad applicability. To overcome the abovementioned limitations, we produced in this study a novel reporter plasmid, pBSII NLS-MC-EGFP-tdTomato (pBET2), that can be used in the oligo swapping method. In this method, a nicking endonuclease produces a single-stranded DNA gap on a double-stranded DNA plasmid that can be replaced by ligation with synthetic oligonucleotides. It is significantly easier and more user-friendly than previous assays, which require in vitro DNA synthesis with single-stranded plasmid DNA and purification using ultracentrifugation in cesium chloride-ethidium bromide gradients. The plasmid also contains a nicking site that allows the MMR repair machinery to efficiently distinguish the newly synthesized strand as a target for repair. In addition, a nuclear localization signal facilitates green fluorescent protein expression in the nucleus, which helps to verify the effectiveness of MMR using fluorescence microscopy.

        "abstract": "Myoglobin is a protein that is expressed quite unevenly among different cell types. Nevertheless, it has been widely acknowledged that the Fe<sup>3+</sup> state of myoglobin, <i>met</i>myoglobin (<i>met</i>Mb) has a broad functional role in metabolism, oxidative/nitrative regulation and gene networks. Accordingly, real-time monitoring of oxygenated, deoxygenated and <i>met</i>Mb proportions- or, more broadly, of the mechanisms by which <i>met</i>Mb is formed, presents a promising line of research. We had previously introduced a Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) method to read out the deoxygenation/oxygenation states of myoglobin, by creating the targetable oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) sensor Myoglobin-mCherry. In this sensor, changes in myoglobin absorbance features that occur with lost O<sub>2</sub> occupancy -or upon <i>met</i>Mb production- control the FRET rate from the fluorescent protein to myoglobin. When O<sub>2</sub> is bound, mCherry fluorescence is only slightly quenched, but if either O<sub>2</sub> is released or <i>met</i> is produced, FRET will increase- and this rate competing with emission reduces both emission yield and lifetime. Nitric oxide (NO) is an important signal (but also a toxic molecule) that can oxidize myoglobin to <i>met</i>Mb with absorbance increases in the red visible range. mCherry thus senses both <i>met</i> and deoxygenated myoglobin, which cannot be easily separated at hypoxia. In order to dissect this, we treat cells with NO and investigate how the Myoglobin-mCherry lifetime is affected by generating <i>met</i>Mb. More discriminatory power is then achieved when the fluorescent protein EYFP is added to Myoglobin-mCherry, creating a sandwich probe whose lifetime can selectively respond to <i>met</i>Mb while being indifferent to O<sub>2</sub> occupancy.",

The taste bud is a tightly packed cell population, wherein extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> is expected to fluctuate markedly due to the electrical activity of taste cells. It is currently unclear whether the Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry-driven synapse in type III cells could be reliable enough at unsteady extracellular Ca<sup>2</sup>. Here we assayed depolarization-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals and associated serotonin release in isolated type III cells at varied extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>. It turned out that the same depolarizing stimulus elicited invariant Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in type III cells irrespective of bath Ca<sup>2+</sup> varied within 0.5-5 mM. The serotonin release from type III cells was assayed with the biosensor approach by using HEK-293 cells co-expressing the recombinant 5-HT4 receptor and genetically encoded cAMP sensor Pink Flamindo. Consistently with the weak Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependence of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients produced by VG Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry, depolarization-triggered serotonin secretion varied negligibly with bath Ca<sup>2+</sup>.

Amantadine is an antiviral agent also effective in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. However, while its potential side effects associated with tetralogy of fallot (ToF) and birth defects were implicated, its underlying etiologic mechanisms of action remain unknown. Here, we report teratogenic effects of amantadine drug during early cardiogenesis through developing a novel zebrafish (<i>Danio rerio</i>) knock-in (KI) animal model and explore the underlying mechanisms. Homologous recombination (HR) pathway triggered by CRISPR/Cas9 system was utilized to generate an enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) KI zebrafish animal model. Dynamic fluorescence imaging coupled with a whole-mount <i>in-situ</i> hybridization (WISH) assay was employed to compare the spatial and temporal expression patterns of the EGFP reporter in the KI animal model with the KI-targeted endogenous gene. Heart morphology and EGFP expression dynamics in the KI animal models were monitored to assess cardiac side effects of different doses of amantadine hydrochloride. Expression of key genes required for myocardium differentiation and left-right (LR) asymmetry was analyzed using WISH and quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). A novel EGFP KI line targeted at the ventricular myosin heavy chain (<i>vmhc)</i> gene locus was successfully generated, in which EGFP reporter could faithfully recapitulate the endogenous expression dynamics of the ventricle chamber-specific expression of the <i>vmhc</i> gene. Amantadine drug treatment-induced ectopic expression of <i>vmhc</i> gene in the atrium and caused cardiac-looping or LR asymmetry defects to dose-dependently during early cardiogenesis, concomitant with dramatically reduced expression levels of key genes required for myocardium differentiation and LR asymmetry. We generated a novel zebrafish KI animal model in which EGFP reports the ventricle chamber-specific expression of <i>vmhc</i> gene dynamics that is useful to effectively assess drug safety on the cardiac morphology <i>in vivo</i>.

We searched for NIPBL 5'-UTR variants potentially introducing uORF by (i) reannotating NGS data of 102 unsolved CdLS patients and (ii) literature and variant databases search. We set up a green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter assay and studied NIPBL expression in a lymphoblastoid cell line (LCL). We identified two variants introducing a novel ATG codon sequence in the 5'-UTR of NIPBL, both predicted to introduce uORF: a novel c.-457_-456delinsAT de novo mutation in a 15-year-old male with classic CdLS, and a c.-94C>T variant in a published family. Our reporter assay showed a significant decrease of GFP levels in both mutant contexts, with similar levels of messenger RNA (mRNA) as compared to wt constructs.

To examine whether this newly generated transgenic mouse line is applicable in labeling of protein-protein interaction, we used a previously reported transgenic mouse lines that express Notch1 receptor with its intracellular domain replaced with a yeast transcription factor, Gal4. Upon the binding of this artificial Notch1 receptor and endogenous Notch1 ligands, Gal4 would be cleaved from the cell membrane to induce expression of Cre recombinase and miRFP670. Indeed, we observed miRFP670 signal in the mouse embryos (embryonic day 14.5). In addition, we examined whether our Cre recombinase was functional by using another transgenic mouse line that express dsRed after Cre-mediated recombination. We observed dsRed signal in small intestine epithelial cells where Notch1 signal was suggested to be involved in the crypt stem cell maintenance, suggesting that our Cre recombinase was functional.

        "abstract": "Cytoplasmic pH in bacteria is tightly regulated by diverse active mechanisms and interconnected regulatory processes. Many processes and regulators underlying pH homeostasis have been identified via phenotypic screening of strain libraries for nongrowth at low or high pH values. Direct screens with respect to changes of the internal pH in mutant strain collections are limited by laborious methods, which include fluorescent dyes and radioactive probes. Genetically encoded biosensors equip single organisms or strain libraries with an internal sensor molecule during the generation of the strain. Here, we used the pH-sensitive mCherry variant mCherryEA as a ratiometric pH biosensor. We visualized the internal pH of Escherichia coli colonies on agar plates by the use of a GelDoc imaging system. Combining this imaging technology with robot-assisted colony picking and spotting allowed us to screen and select mutants with altered internal pH values from a small transposon mutagenesis-derived E. coli library. Identification of the transposon (Tn) insertion sites in strains with altered internal pH levels revealed that the transposon was inserted into <i>trkH</i> (encoding a transmembrane protein of the potassium uptake system) or <i>rssB</i> (encoding the adaptor protein RssB, which mediates the proteolytic degradation of the general stress response regulator RpoS), two genes known to be associated with pH homeostasis and pH stress adaptation. This successful screening approach demonstrates that the pH sensor-based analysis of arrayed colonies on agar plates is a sensitive approach for the rapid identification of genes involved in pH homeostasis or pH stress adaptation in E. coli. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Phenotypic screening of strain libraries on agar plates has become a versatile tool to understand gene functions and to optimize biotechnological platform organisms. Screening is supported by genetically encoded biosensors that allow to easily measure intracellular processes. For this purpose, transcription factor-based biosensors have emerged as the sensor type of choice. Here, the target stimulus initiates the activation of a response gene (e.g., a fluorescent protein), followed by transcription, translation, and maturation. Due to this mechanistic principle, biosensor readouts are delayed and cannot report the actual intracellular state of the cell in real time. To capture rapid intracellular processes adequately, fluorescent reporter proteins are extensively applied. However, these sensor types have not previously been used for phenotypic screenings. To take advantage of their properties, we established here an imaging method that allows application of a rapid ratiometric sensor protein for assessing the internal pH of colonies in a high-throughput manner.",

We isolated 10 E. coli strains and sequenced the genomes of two of them. Phylogenetically, the two isolates were closer to strains isolated from poultry meat than to freshwater E. coli, albeit their genomes were smaller than those of the poultry isolates. After isolation and fluorescent protein tagging of strains ED1 and ED157, we show that <i>Daphnia</i> sp. can take up these strains and release them alive again, thus becoming a temporary host for E. coli. In a chemostat experiment, we show that this association does not prolong bacterial long-term survival, but at low abundances it also does not significantly reduce bacterial numbers. We demonstrate that E. coli does not belong to the core microbiota of <i>Daphnia</i>, suffers from competition by the natural <i>Daphnia</i> microbiota, but can profit from its carapax to survive in water. All in all, this study suggests that the association of E. coli with <i>Daphnia</i> is only temporary, but the cells are viable therein, and this might allow encounters with other bacteria for genetic exchange and potential genomic adaptation to the freshwater environment. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> The contamination of freshwater with feces-derived bacteria is a major concern regarding drinking water acquisition and recreational activities.

        "abstract": "Elevation of intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) activates Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinases (CaMK) and promotes gene transcription. This signaling pathway is referred to as excitation–transcription (E-T) coupling. Although vascular myocytes can exhibit E-T coupling, the molecular mechanisms and physiological/pathological roles are unknown. Multiscale analysis spanning from single molecules to whole organisms has revealed essential steps in mouse vascular myocyte E-T coupling. Upon a depolarizing stimulus, Ca2+ influx through Cav1.2 voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels activates CaMKK2 and CaMK1a, resulting in intranuclear CREB phosphorylation. Within caveolae, the formation of a molecular complex of Cav1.2/CaMKK2/CaMK1a is promoted in vascular myocytes. Live imaging using a genetically encoded Ca2+ indicator revealed direct activation of CaMKK2 by Ca2+ influx through Cav1.2 localized to caveolae. CaMK1a is phosphorylated by CaMKK2 at caveolae and translocated to the nucleus upon membrane depolarization. In addition, sustained depolarization of a mesenteric artery preparation induced genes related to chemotaxis, leukocyte adhesion, and inflammation, and these changes were reversed by inhibitors of Cav1.2, CaMKK2, and CaMK, or disruption of caveolae. In the context of pathophysiology, when the mesenteric artery was loaded by high pressure in vivo, we observed CREB phosphorylation in myocytes, macrophage accumulation at adventitia, and an increase in thickness and cross-sectional area of the tunica media. These changes were reduced in caveolin1-knockout mice or in mice treated with the CaMKK2 inhibitor STO609. In summary, E-T coupling depends on Cav1.2/CaMKK2/CaMK1a localized to caveolae, and this complex converts [Ca2+]i changes into gene transcription. This ultimately leads to macrophage accumulation and media remodeling for adaptation to increased circumferential stretch.",

Taking advantage of the photoswitching property of mEosEM-E, the autofluorescence background from the resin was significantly reduced by a subtraction-based CLEM (sCLEM) method.

        "abstract": "Our understanding of chloride in biology has been accelerated through the application of fluorescent protein-based sensors in living cells. These sensors can be generated and diversified to have a range of properties using laboratory-guided evolution. Recently, we established that the fluorescent proton-pumping rhodopsin <i>wt</i>GR from <i>Gloeobacter violaceus</i> can be converted into a fluorescent sensor for chloride. To unlock this non-natural function, a single point mutation at the Schiff counterion position (D121V) was introduced into <i>wt</i>GR fused to cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) resulting in GR1-CFP. Here, we have integrated coevolutionary analysis with directed evolution to understand how the rhodopsin sequence space can be explored and engineered to improve this starting point. We first show how evolutionary couplings are predictive of functional sites in the rhodopsin family and how a fitness metric based on a sequence can be used to quantify the known proton-pumping activities of GR-CFP variants. Then, we couple this ability to predict potential functional outcomes with a screening and selection assay in live <i>Escherichia coli</i> to reduce the mutational search space of five residues along the proton-pumping pathway in GR1-CFP. This iterative selection process results in GR2-CFP with four additional mutations: E132K, A84K, T125C, and V245I. Finally, bulk and single fluorescence measurements in live <i>E. coli</i> reveal that GR2-CFP is a reversible, ratiometric fluorescent sensor for extracellular chloride with an improved dynamic range. We anticipate that our framework will be applicable to other systems, providing a more efficient methodology to engineer fluorescent protein-based sensors with desired properties.",

In this sense, the objective of this work was to generate bioluminescent reporter strains of Paracoccidioides spp. harboring a thermostable, red-shifted luciferase gene under the control of different constitutive promoters. The strains were generated by the integration of a species-specific codon-optimized luciferase gene upon actin or enolase promoter's control. The insertion of the constructs in Paracoccidioides brasiliensis and Paracoccidioides lutzii yeast cells were performed through Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation. The results demonstrated the presence of several transformants harboring the luciferase gene. These transformants were further confirmed by the expression of luciferase and by the presence of the hygromycin resistance gene. Moreover, the luciferase activity could be detected in in vitro bioluminescence assays and in vivo models of infection. In general, this work presents the methodology for the construction of bioluminescent strains of Paracoccidioides spp., highlighting potential promoters and proposing an in vivo model, in which those strains could be used for the systemic study of PCM.",

Robust delivery of genes of interest into target cells, long-term gene expression, and minimal risk of secondary effects are highly desirable for translational medicine including gene therapy and studies on gene function. However, efficient gene delivery into viral or nonviral B-lymphoma cells remains a challenge. Here, we report a strategy for inducing foreign gene expression in B-lymphoma cells by using a vector based on the novel parainfluenza virus PIV5-L (a strain isolated from B cells) that enabled us to study and control the function of a gene product within B-lymphoma cells. Using enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) as a reporter, we successfully rescued PIV5-L and established a one-step system to generate PIV5-L virus-like particles (L-VLPs) with efficient delivery into a broad spectrum of susceptible B-lymphoma cell lines, including Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)- or Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV)-transformed B-lymphoblastoid cells. Similar to lentiviral vector, the L-VLP highly expressed exogenous genes and remained stable for long periods without obvious negative effects on cell viability. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the PIV5-L-based system provides a potential new strategy for the delivery of desirable genes and the treatment of cancer. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> B-cell lymphoma is a common aggressive neoplastic disorder of lymphocytes.

However, little is known about why the TSS cases are rare, although <i>S. aureus</i> strains frequently carry a <i>tst</i> gene, which encodes TSST-1. To answer this question, the amount of TSST-1 produced by 541 clinical isolates was measured in both the presence and absence of serum supplementation to growth media. Then a set of <i>S. aureus</i> strains with similar genetic backgrounds isolated from patients presenting with non-mTSS and those with clinical manifestations other than non-mTSS was compared for their TSST-1 inducibility by human serum, and their whole-genome sequences were determined. Subsequently, the association of mutations identified in the <i>tst</i> promoter of non-mTSS strains with TSST-1 inducibility by human serum was evaluated by constructing promoter replacement mutants and green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter recombinants. Results showed that 39 out of 541 clinical isolates (7.2%), including strains isolated from non-mTSS patients, had enhanced production of TSST-1 in the presence of serum. TSST-1 inducibility by human serum was more clearly seen in non-mTSS strains of clonal complex (CC)-5. Moreover, the whole-genome sequence analysis identified a set of sequence variations at a putative SarA-binding site of the <i>tst</i> promoter. This sequence variation was proven to be partially responsible for the induction of TSST-1 production by human serum.

These dopamine signals can be differentially translated by dopamine receptor type 1 and type 2, DRD1 and DRD2, which are G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). In response to dopamine, DRD1 and DRD2 are known to mediate opposite functions on cAMP production via Gs and Gi protein signaling. Interestingly, they can form a heterodimer. However, receptor crosstalk between DRD1-DRD2 heterodimers has not been directly measured, but it was only inferred from measuring downstream signaling pathways. Here we develop fluorescent protein-based multicolor biosensors which can monitor individual activation states of DRD1 and DRD2, and apply them to directly monitor the functional crosstalk between DRD1-DRD2 heterodimers in live cells. Utilizing these powerful tools, we surprisingly discover differential crosstalk in the DRD1-DRD2 heterodimers upon different dopamine (DA) levels: DRD1 activation is selectively inhibited at micromolar DA levels, while DRD2 is inhibited only by nanomolar DA concentration, implying a novel function of the DRD1-DRD2 heterodimer upon different DA levels. Our results imply differential receptor crosstalk and novel functions of the DRD1-DRD2 heterodimer in response to physiological dopamine levels from nanomolar to micromolar dopamine concentrations.",

The driven activities of viral promoters were generally assessed to screen available promoters for transgenic and research and biotech industries. In this study, we cloned a full-length promoter from a Chinese isolate of strawberry vein banding virus (SVBV) and produced several deletion mutants for evaluation of applications in production of reporter proteins in stable transgenic plants. The full-length promoter of SVBV (SP1) and its three deletion mutants (SP2, SP3, and SP4) were amplified using polymerase chain reaction. The effects of SVBV SP1, SP2, SP3, and SP4 on gene expression were evaluated using β-glucuronidase (GUS) and green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter genes. Transient expression assays showed that the SVBV SP1 promoter and its three deletion mutants all expressed the reporter genes, albeit at very different levels. Interestingly, transcriptional activity driven by the SP1 promoter was much higher than that of the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter. After stable transformation of the GUS gene into Nicotiana tabacum plants, SVBV SP1-driven transgene expression was approximately 2.6-fold higher than CaMV 35S promoter-driven transgene expression. In addition, GUS gene expression levels were enhanced by co-inoculation of the plants with the SP1 promoter-driven vector carrying the GUS gene and the vector expressing SVBV open reading frame (ORF) V or ORF VI. The SVBV SP1 promoter from the Chinese isolate evaluated in this study could successfully drive transient and stable expression in plants, it was a stronger promoter than the CaMV 35S and FLt-US promoters and may be more useful for the production of stable transgenic plants.",

Despite substantial progress in uncovering a wide variety of complicated mechanisms of virus entry, intracellular transport of viral components, virus assembly, and egress, the temporal and spatial dynamics of viral genes trafficking within the nucleus remains poorly understood. Herein, using single-particle tracking, we explored the real-time dynamic nuclear trafficking of influenza A virus (IAV) genes packaged as the viral ribonucleoprotein complexes (vRNPs) by combining a four-plasmid DNA transfection system for the reconstruction of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-labeled vRNPs and a spinning disk super-resolution fluorescence microscope. We found that IAV infection significantly induced the formation of actin microfilaments (F-actin) in the nucleus. In combination with the fluorescent protein-tagged nuclear F-actin probe, we visualized the directed movement of GFP-labeled vRNPs foci along the nuclear F-actin with a speed of 0.18 μm/s, which is similar to the microfilaments-dependent slow directed motion of IAVs in the cytoplasm. The disruption of nuclear F-actin after treatment with microfilament inhibitors caused a considerable decrease in vRNPs motility and suppressed the nuclear export of newly produced vRNPs, indicating that the slow, directed movement plays a crucial role in facilitating the nuclear egress of vRNPs. Our findings identified a nuclear F-actin-dependent pathway for IAV vRNPs transporting from the nucleus into the cytoplasm, which may in turn uncover a novel target for antiviral treatment.",

To address this, we developed FRET and lanthanide-based FRET (LRET) biosensors of Rac1 activation with two key features that enhance sensitivity and dynamic range. For one, alpha helical linker domains separate FRET partners and ensure a large conformational change and FRET increase when activated Rac1 at the biosensor C-terminus interacts with an amino-terminal Rac binding domain. Incorporation of a luminescent Tb(III) complex with long (~ ms) excited state lifetime as a LRET donor enabled time-gated luminescence measurements of Rac1 activity in cell lysates. The LRET dynamic range increased with ER/K linker length up to 1100% and enabled robust detection of Rac1 inhibition in 96-well plates. The ER/K linkers had a less pronounced, but still significant, effect on conventional FRET biosensors (with FP donors and acceptors), and we were able to dynamically image Rac1 activation at cell edges using fluorescence microscopy.

However, obtaining direct evidence of spontaneous EV transfer <i>in vivo</i> remains challenging. In our previous study, a single-guide RNA (sgRNA): Cas9 ribonucleoprotein complex, which can efficiently delete target genes, was delivered into recipient cells using an engineered EV. <b>Aim:</b> Applying this newly discovered exosomal bio-cargo to track the uptake and distribution of tumor EVs. <b>Methods:</b> Tumor cells of interest were engineered to express and release the sgRNA:Cas9 complex, and a reporter cell/system containing STOP-fluorescent protein (FP) elements was also generated. EV-delivered Cas9 proteins from donor cells were programmed by a pair of sgRNAs to completely delete a blockade sequence and, in turn, recuperated the expression of FP in recipient reporter cells. Thus, fluorescently illuminated cells indicate the uptake of EVs. To improve the efficiency and sensitivity of this tracking system <i>in vivo</i>, we optimized the sgRNA design, which could more efficiently trigger the expression of reporter proteins. <b>Results:</b> We demonstrated the EV-mediated crosstalk between tumor cells, and between tumor cells and normal cells <i>in vitro</i>. <i>In vivo</i>, we showed that intravenously administered EVs can be taken up by the liver.

A single missense mutation of U to G at nucleotide position 1355 (U1355G) in the spike (S) gene changes leucine to arginine (L452R) in the spike protein. This mutation has been observed in the India and California strains (B.1.617 and B.1.427/B.1.429, respectively). Control of COVID-19 requires rapid and reliable detection of SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, we established a reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay plus a bioluminescent assay in real-time (BART) to detect SARS-CoV-2 and the L452R spike mutation. The specificity and sensitivity of the RT-LAMP-BART assay was evaluated using synthetic RNAs including target sequences and RNA-spiked clinical nasopharyngeal and saliva specimens as well as reference strains representing five viral and four bacterial pathogens. The novel RT-LAMP-BART assay to detect SARS-CoV-2 was highly specific compared to the conventional real-time RT-PCR. Within 25 min, the RT-LAMP-BART assay detected 80 copies of the target gene in a sample, whereas the conventional real-time RT-PCR method detected 5 copies per reaction within 130 min. Using RNA-spiked specimens, the sensitivity of the RT-LAMP-BART assay was slightly attenuated compared to purified RNA as a template. The results were identical to those of the conventional real-time RT-PCR method. Furthermore, using a peptide nucleic acid (PNA) probe, the RT-LAMP-BART method correctly identified the L452R spike mutation.

The identification of an optimally overexpressing strain following transformation can be time and reagent consuming. Fluorescent reporters like GFP have been used to assist identification of superior producers, but their relatively big size, maturation requirements and narrow temperature range restrict their applications. Here, we introduce the use of iLOV, a flavin-based fluorescent protein, as a fluorescent marker to identify P. pastoris high-yielding strains easily and rapidly. The use of this fluorescent protein as a fusion partner is exemplified by the production of the antimicrobial peptide NI01, a difficult target to overexpress in its native form. iLOV fluorescence correlated well with protein expression level and copy number of the chromosomally integrated gene. An easy and simple medium-throughput plate-based screen directly following transformation is demonstrated for low complexity screening, while a high-throughput method using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) allowed for comprehensive library screening. Both codon optimization of the iLOV_NI01 fusion cassettes and different integration strategies into the P. pastoris genome were tested to produce and isolate a high-yielding strain. Checking the genetic stability, process reproducibility and following the purification of the active native peptide are eased by visualization of and efficient cleavage from the iLOV reporter. We show that this system can be used for expression and screening of several different antimicrobial peptides recombinantly produced in P. pastoris.",

        "abstract": "Selective degradation of mitochondria by autophagy (mitophagy) is thought to play an important role in mitochondrial quality control, but our understanding of which conditions induce mitophagy in plants is limited. Here, we developed novel reporter lines to monitor mitophagy in plants and surveyed the rate of mitophagy under a wide range of stresses and developmental conditions. Especially carbon starvation induced by dark-incubation causes a dramatic increase in mitophagy within a few hours, further increasing as dark-induced senescence progresses. Natural senescence was also a strong trigger of mitophagy, peaking when leaf yellowing became prominent. In contrast, nitrogen starvation, a trigger of general autophagy, does not induce strong increases in mitophagy. Similarly, general stresses such as hydrogen peroxide, heat, UV-B and hypoxia did not appear to trigger substantial mitophagy in plants. Additionally, we exposed plants to inhibitors of the mitochondrial electron transport chain, mitochondrial translation and protein import. Although short-term treatments did not induce high mitophagy rates, longer term exposures to uncoupling agent and inhibitors of mitochondrial protein import/translation could clearly increase mitophagic flux. These findings could further be confirmed using confocal microscopy. To validate that mitophagy is mediated by the autophagy pathway, we showed that mitophagic flux is abolished or strongly decreased in <i>atg5/AuTophaGy 5</i> and <i>atg11</i> mutants, respectively. Finally, we observed high rates of mitophagy in etiolated seedlings, which remarkably was completely repressed within 6 h after light exposure. In conclusion, we propose that dark-induced carbon starvation, natural senescence and specific mitochondrial stresses are key triggers of mitophagy in plants.<b>Abbreviations:</b> AA: antimycin A; ATG: AuToPhagy related; ConA: concanamycin A; DIS: dark-induced senescence; Dox: doxycycline; FCCP: carbonyl cyanide-p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone; GFP: green fluorescent protein; IDH1: isocitrate dehydrogenase 1; MB: MitoBlock-6; Mito-GFP: transgenic Arabidopsis line expressing a mitochondrially targeted protein fused to GFP; mtETC: mitochondrial electron transport chain; OXPHOS: oxidative phosphorylation; PQC: protein quality control; TOM20: Translocase of Outer Membrane 20.",

However, the current approaches are not suitable for the monitoring of pathway activation dynamics, and they are mostly based on expression constructs that lack physiological promoter regulation. We recently developed MCF7 fluorescent reporter cell lines of 3 different green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged ERα target genes: GREB1, PGR and TFF1. These reporters are under control of the full physiological promoter region and allow the monitoring of dynamic pro-proliferative pathway activation on a single cell level using a live-cell imaging set-up. In this study, we systematically characterized the response of these reporters to a full reference compound set of known estrogenic and non-estrogenic chemicals as defined by the Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD). We linked activation of the pro-proliferative ERα pathway to a potential adverse outcome by additionally monitoring cell cycle progression and proliferation. The correct classification of the OECD reference compounds showed that our reporter platform has the same sensitivity and specificity as other validated artificial ERα pathway reporters, such as the ERα CALUX and VM7 Luc ER TA assay. By monitoring several key events (i.e. ER target activation, cell cycle progression and proliferation), and subsequently determining Point-of-Departure (POD) values, our reporter panel can be used in high-throughput testing for a physiologically more relevant, quantitative temporal endocrine modulation analysis to improve human carcinogen risk assessment.",

These systems are useful for multiple applications including production of difficult proteins, as high-throughput tools for genetic circuit screening, and as systems for biosensor development. Though rapidly evolving, CFPS suffer from some disadvantages such as limited reaction rates due to longer diffusion times, significant cost per assay when using commercially sourced materials, and reduced reagent stability over prolonged periods. To address some of these challenges, we conducted a series of proof-of-concept experiments to demonstrate enhancement of CFPS productivity via nanoparticle assembly driven nanoaggregation of its constituent proteins. We combined a commercially available CFPS that utilizes purified polyhistidine-tagged (His-tag) TX-TL machinery with CdSe/CdS/ZnS core/shell/shell quantum dots (QDs) known to readily coordinate His-tagged proteins in an oriented fashion. We show that nanoparticle scaffolding of the CFPS cross-links the QDs into nanoaggregate structures while enhancing the production of functional recombinant super-folder green fluorescent protein and phosphotriesterase, an organophosphate hydrolase; the latter by up to 12-fold. This enhancement, which occurs by an undetermined mechanism, has the potential to improve CFPS in general and specifically CFPS-based biosensors (faster response time) while also enabling rapid detoxification/bioremediation through point-of-concern synthesis of similar catalytic enzymes. We further show that such nanoaggregates improve production in diluted CFPS reactions, which can help to save money and extend the amount of these costly reagents.

In this report, we demonstrate a nonmonotonic dependence of protein expression on the mass of transfected replicon, in contrast to the usual, monotonic case of non-saRNA transfections. We lipotransfected a variety of cell lines with increasing masses of enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (eYFP) as a reporter gene in sa form and found that there is a \"sweet spot\" at which protein expression and cell viability are optimum. To control the varying mass of transfected replicon RNA for a given mass of Lipofectamine, the replicons were mixed with a \"carrier\" RNA that is neither replicated nor translated; the total mass of transfected RNA was kept constant while increasing the fraction of the replicon from zero to one. Fluorescence microscopy studies showed that the optimum protein expression and cell viability are achieved for replicon fractions as small as 1/10 of the total transfected RNA, and these results were quantified by a systematic series of flow cytometry measurements. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Positive-sense RNA viruses often have a cytotoxic effect on their host cell because of the strength of their RNA replicase proteins, even though only one copy of their genome begins the viral life cycle in each cell. Noninfectious forms of them-replicons-which include just their RNA replication-related genes, are also strongly self-amplifying and cytotoxic. Accordingly, when replicons fused with nonviral genes of interest are transfected into cells to amplify expression of proteins of interest, one needs to keep the replicon \"dose\" sufficiently low. We demonstrate how to control the number of RNA replicons getting into transfected cells and that there is a sweet spot for the replicon dose that optimizes protein expression and cell viability. Examples are given for the case of Nodamura viral replicons with fluorescent protein reporter genes in a variety of mammalian cell lines, quantified by flow cytometry and live/dead cell assays.",

Most cAMP reporters have been designed to undergo changes in fluorescence resonance energy transfer but there are alternative techniques with advantages for certain applications.

Changes in reporter localization can be detected with either confocal or total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy but signal changes are more robust and image analyses less complicated with the latter technique. We show how translocation reporters can be used to study sub-plasma membrane cAMP signals, including oscillations, in insulin-secreting β-cells stimulated with glucose and G-protein-coupled receptor agonists. We also demonstrate how translocation reporters can be combined with other sensors for simultaneous recordings of the cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration, protein kinase A activity or plasma-membrane binding of the cAMP effector protein Epac2. Fluorescent translocation reporters thus provide a versatile complement to the growing cAMP imaging toolkit for elucidating sub-plasma membrane cAMP signals in various types of cells.",

Among the most challenging of subcellular signaling microdomains to assay is the primary cilium. A petite but visually arresting organelle, the primary cilium extends from the cell surface of most non-dividing cells. Recently, the concept of the primary cilium as an independent cAMP signaling organelle has attracted substantial interest. The cilium sequesters a very specific subset of ciliary cAMP-linked GPCRs in its membrane (e.g., 5-HT<sub>6</sub>, D1R, MCR4, FFAR4, TGR5), as well as other key components of the cAMP signaling machinery that include adenylyl cyclases, GNAS, phosphodiesterases, PKA holoenzyme, and biologically important PKA targets. Here we provide a practical guide to assessing ciliary cAMP signals in live cells using targeted genetically encoded FRET biosensors. Key experimental difficulties include gathering sufficient signal from such a small, photon-limited volume, and the susceptibility of cilia to movement artifacts. Other challenges are associated with the fidelity of sensor targeting and the difficulties in distinguishing between cAMP signals produced exclusively within the cilium vs. those that emanate from the cell body. Here we describe ratio imaging approaches used in our lab for time-resolved visualization of ciliary cAMP in cultured renal cells.

Here we used a recently developed OpenUaa search engine to perform an in-depth analysis of mass spec data generated for Thioredoxin and its direct binding proteins cross-linked with an alkyl bromide-based ncAA, BprY.

We then successfully applied BprY to map a binding interface between SUMO2 and SUMO-interacting motifs (SIMs). BprY was further applied to probe SUMO2 interaction partners. We identified 264 SUMO2 binders, including several validated SUMO2 binders and many new binders.

To decipher how the DNA replication checkpoint (DRC) allows cells to enter mitosis over time upon RS, we developed a FRET-based Chk1 activity sensor. During unperturbed growth, a basal Chk1 activity level is sustained throughout S phase and relies on replication origin firing. Incremental RS triggers stepwise Chk1 over-activation that delays S-phase, suggesting a rheostat-like role for DRC coupled with the replication machinery. Upon RS, Chk1 is inactivated as DNA replication terminates but surprisingly is reactivated in a subset of G2 cells, which relies on Cdk1/2 and Plk1 and prevents mitotic entry. Cells can override active Chk1 signaling and reach mitosis onset, revealing checkpoint adaptation. Cell division following Chk1 reactivation in G2 results in a p53/p21-dependent G1 arrest, eliminating the daughter cells from proliferation.",

However, promoter libraries that are applicable to <i>C. glutamicum</i> have been rarely reported, except for a few developed based on synthetic sequences containing random mutations. In this study, we constructed a promoter library based on the native promoter of <i>odhA</i> gene by mutating the -10 region and the bystanders. Using a red fluorescent protein (RFP) as the reporter, 57 promoter mutants were screened by fluorescence imaging technology in a high-throughput manner. These mutants spanned a strength range between 2.4-fold and 19.6-fold improvements of the wild-type promoter. The strongest mutant exhibited a 2.3-fold higher strength than the widely used strong inducible promoter P<i><sub>trc</sub></i>. Sequencing of all 57 mutants revealed that 55 mutants share a 1-4 bases shift (4 bases shift for 68% mutants) of the conserved -10 motif \"TANNNT\" to the 3' end of the promoter, compared to the wild-type promoter. Conserved T or G bases at different positions were observed for strong, moderate, and weak promoter mutants. Finally, five promoter mutants with different strength were employed to fine-tune the expression of γ-glutamyl kinase (ProB) for L-proline biosynthesis. Increased promoter strength led to enhanced L-proline production and the highest L-proline titer of 6.4 g/L was obtained when a promoter mutant with a 9.8-fold higher strength compared to the wild-type promoter was used for ProB expression. The use of stronger promoter variants did not further improve L-proline production. In conclusion, a promoter library was constructed based on a native <i>C. glutamicum</i> promoter P<i><sub>odhA</sub></i>. The new promoter library should be useful for systems metabolic engineering of <i>C. glutamicum</i>.

Reverse-genetics studies of viral genes and mutations have proven highly valuable in advancing basic virus research, leading to the development of therapeutics. We developed a functional and highly versatile full-length SARS-CoV-2 infectious system by cloning the sequence of a COVID-19 associated virus isolate (DK-AHH1) into a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC). Viruses recovered after RNA-transfection of in vitro transcripts into Vero E6 cells showed growth kinetics and remdesivir susceptibility similar to the DK-AHH1 virus isolate. Insertion of reporter genes, green fluorescent protein, and nanoluciferase into the ORF7 genomic region led to high levels of reporter activity, which facilitated high throughput treatment experiments. We found that putative coronavirus remdesivir resistance-associated substitutions F480L and V570L-and naturally found polymorphisms A97V, P323L, and N491S, all in nsp12-did not decrease SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility to remdesivir. A nanoluciferase reporter clone with deletion of spike (S), envelope (E), and membrane (M) proteins exhibited high levels of transient replication, was inhibited by remdesivir, and therefore could function as an efficient non-infectious subgenomic replicon system. The developed SARS-CoV-2 reverse-genetics systems, including recombinants to modify infectious viruses and non-infectious subgenomic replicons with autonomous genomic RNA replication, will permit high-throughput cell culture studies-providing fundamental understanding of basic biology of this coronavirus. We have proven the utility of the systems in rapidly introducing mutations in nsp12 and studying their effect on the efficacy of remdesivir, which is used worldwide for the treatment of COVID-19.

Exogenous (i.e., nutrients, deterioration of media components, xenobiotics) and endogenous factors (i.e., metabolism, growth) may alter the redox homeostasis of cells. Thus, monitoring redox changes in real time and in situ is deemed essential for optimizing the production of recombinant proteins. Recently, different redox-sensitive variants of green fluorescent proteins (e.g., rxYFP, roGFP2, and rxmRuby2) have been engineered and proved suitable to detect, in a non-invasive manner, perturbations in the pool of reduced and oxidized glutathione, the major low molecular mass thiol in mammals. In this study, we validate the use of cytosolic rxYFP on two cell lines widely used in biomanufacturing processes, namely, CHO-K1 cells expressing the human granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (hGM-CSF) and HEK-293. Flow cytometry was selected as the read-out technique for rxYFP signal given its high-throughput and statistical robustness. Growth kinetics and cellular metabolism (glucose consumption, lactate and ammonia production) of the redox reporter cells were comparable to those of the parental cell lines. The hGM-CSF production was not affected by the expression of the biosensor. The redox reporter cell lines showed a sensitive and reversible response to different redox stimuli (reducing and oxidant reagents). Under batch culture conditions, a significant and progressive oxidation of the biosensor occurred when CHO-K1-hGM-CSF cells entered the late-log phase.

Compared with quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and the <i>lacZ</i> reporter system, two methods commonly used for in vivo study of nitrogenase regulation in photosynthetic bacteria, the fluorescent protein reporter system has advantages in terms of its simplicity and sensitivity. However, little is known concerning if the fluorescent protein reporter system can be used in bacterial cells that need to grow anaerobically. Here, we developed an RFP-based method to measure the nitrogenase gene expression in photosynthetic bacteria grown anaerobically. This method was able to determine the levels of both the genome-based and the plasmid-based nitrogenase expression under anaerobic conditions, providing a better method for in vivo study of gene expression affected by oxygen. The RFP reporter system developed here will promote a better understanding of the molecular mechanism of nitrogenase regulation and will be used on other genes of interest in a wider range of anaerobic bacteria.",

A cell-based high-throughput screening system might be a powerful tool for identifying osteoblast-targeting candidates; however, this approach is generally limited with using only one molecule as a cell-based sensor that does not always reflect the activation of the osteogenic phenotype. In the present study, we used the MC3T3-E1 cell line stably transfected with the green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter gene driven by a fragment of type I collagen promoter (Col-1a1GFP-MC3T3-E1) to evaluate a double-screening system to identify osteogenic inducible compounds using a combination of a cell-based reporter assay and detection of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity. Col-1a1GFP-MC3T3-E1 cells were cultured in an osteogenic induction medium after library screening of 1280 pharmacologically active compounds (Lopack<sup>1280</sup>). After 7 days, GFP fluorescence was measured using a microplate reader. After 14 days of osteogenic induction, the cells were stained with ALP. Library screening using the Col-1a1/GFP reporter and ALP staining assay detected three candidates with significant osteogenic induction ability. Furthermore, leflunomide, one of the three detected candidates, significantly promoted new bone formation in vivo.

We measured bioluminescence circadian rhythms of eight species of the genus Lemna and seven species of the genus Wolffiella at various temperatures (20, 25, and 30°C) and light conditions (constant light or constant dark). Wolffiella species inhabit relatively warm areas and lack some tissues/organs found in Lemna species. Lemna species tended to show robust bioluminescence circadian rhythms under all conditions, while Wolffiella species showed lower rhythm stability, especially at higher temperatures. For Lemna, two species (L. valdiviana and L. minuta) forming a clade showed relatively lower circadian stability. For Wolffiella, two species (W. hyalina and W. repanda) forming a clade showed extremely long period lengths.

In addition, the patterns were tested for their potential to eliminate spurious effects from sensor response, caused by refractive index changes in the bulk solution. Shifts in the plasmonic spectrum are exclusively caused by the adsorbing molecules. For this purpose, nanopatterns of interconnected and separated cubes with dimensions ranging from 150 to 600 nm have been fabricated from poly(methyl methacrylate) using electron-beam lithography followed by metallization with gold. It is shown that a small lateral pattern size, a high aspect ratio, and short connection lengths are favorable to generate extinction spectra with well-separated and pronounced peaks. Furthermore, for selected nanostructures, we have been able to identify reflection angles for which the influence of the bulk refractive index on the position of the plasmonic peaks is negligible.

        "abstract": "Photoacoustic (PA) imaging offers promise for biomedical applications due to its ability to image deep within biological tissues while providing detailed molecular information; however, its detection sensitivity is limited by high background signals that arise from endogenous chromophores. Genetic reporter proteins with photoswitchable properties enable the removal of background signals through the subtraction of PA images for each light-absorbing form. Unfortunately, the application of photoswitchable chromoproteins for tumor-targeted imaging has been hampered by the lack of an effective targeted delivery scheme; that is, photoswitchable probes must be delivered in vivo with high targeting efficiency and specificity. To overcome this limitation, we have developed a tumor-targeting delivery system in which tumor-homing bacteria (<i>Escherichia coli</i>) are exploited as carriers to affect the point-specific delivery of genetically encoded photochromic probes to the tumor area. To improve the efficiency of the desired background suppression, we engineered a phytochrome-based reporter protein (m<i>Dr</i>BphP-PCMm/F469W) that displays higher photoswitching contrast than those in the current state of the art. Photoacoustic computed tomography was applied to achieve good depth and resolution in the context of in vivo (mice) imaging. The present system effectively integrates a genetically encoded phytochrome-based reporter protein, PA imaging, and synthetic biology (GPS), to achieve essentially background-suppressed tumor-targeted PA monitoring in deep-seated tissues. The ability to image tumors at substantial depths may enable target-specific cancer diagnoses to be made with greater sensitivity, fidelity, and specificity.",

        "abstract": "Chemistry can be described as the movement of nuclei within molecules and the concomitant instantaneous change in electronic structure. This idea underpins the central chemical concepts of potential energy surfaces and reaction coordinates. To experimentally capture such chemical change therefore requires methods that can probe both the nuclear <i>and</i> electronic structure simultaneously and on the time scale of atomic motion. In this Account, we show how time-resolved photoelectron imaging can do exactly this and how it can be used to build a detailed and intuitive understanding of the electronic structure and excited-state dynamics of chromophores. The chromophore of the photoactive yellow protein (PYP) is used as a case study. This chromophore contains a para-substituted phenolate anion, where the substituent, R, can be viewed as an acrolein derivative. It is shown that the measured photoelectron angular distribution can be directly related to the electronic structure of the para-substituted phenolate anion. By incrementally considering differing R groups, it is also shown that these photoelectron angular distributions are exquisitely sensitive to the conformational flexibility of R and that when R contains a π-system the excited states of the chromophore can be viewed as a linear combination of the π* molecular orbitals on the phenolate (π<sub>Ph</sub>*) and the R substituent (π<sub>R</sub>*). Such Hückel treatment shows that the S<sub>1</sub> state of the PYP chromophore has predominantly π<sub>R</sub>* character and that it is essentially the same as the chromophore of the green fluorescent protein (GFP). The S<sub>1</sub> excited-state dynamics of the PYP chromophore probed by time-resolved photoelectron imaging clearly reveals both structural (nuclear) dynamics through the energy spectrum and electronic dynamics through the photoelectron angular distributions. Both motions can be accurately assigned using quantum chemical calculations, and these are consistent with the intuitive Hückel treatment presented. The photoactive protein chromophores considered here are examples of where a chemists' intuitive Hückel view for ground-state chemistry appears to be transferable to the prediction of photochemical excited-state reactivity. While elegant and insightful, such models have limitations, including nonadiabatic dynamics, which is present in a related PYP chromophore, where a fraction of the S<sub>1</sub> state population forms a nonvalence (dipole-bound) state of the anion.",

Activation of different stress-responsive kinases leads to the phosphorylation of their common downstream target, the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha (eIF2α), which is a critical component of functional translation preinitiation complexes. As a consequence, stalled ribonucleoprotein complexes accumulate in the cytoplasm and condense into microscopically visible cytoplasmic stress granules (SGs). Over the past years, numerous microscopy approaches have been developed to study the spatiotemporal control of SG formation in response to a variety of stressors. Here, we apply long-term live-cell microscopy to monitor the dynamic cellular stress response triggered by infection with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) at single-cell level and study the behavior of infected cells that repeatedly switch between a stressed and unstressed state.

        "abstract": "High-fidelity translation was considered a requirement for living cells. The frozen accident theory suggested that any deviation from the standard genetic code should result in the production of so much mis-made and non-functional proteins that cells cannot remain viable. Studies in bacterial, yeast, and mammalian cells show that significant levels of mistranslation (1-10% per codon) can be tolerated or even beneficial under conditions of oxidative stress. Single tRNA mutants, which occur naturally in the human population, can lead to amino acid mis-incorporation at a codon or set of codons. The rate or level of mistranslation can be difficult or impossible to measure in live cells. We developed a novel red fluorescent protein reporter that is sensitive to serine (Ser) mis-incorporation at proline (Pro) codons. The mCherry Ser151Pro mutant is efficiently produced in <i>Escherichia coli</i> but non-fluorescent. We demonstrated in cells and with purified mCherry protein that the fluorescence of mCherry Ser151Pro is rescued by two different tRNA<sup>Ser</sup> gene variants that were mutated to contain the Pro (UGG) anticodon. Ser mis-incorporation was confirmed by mass spectrometry. Remarkably, <i>E. coli</i> tolerated mistranslation rates of ~10% per codon with negligible reduction in growth rate. Conformational sampling simulations revealed that the Ser151Pro mutant leads to significant changes in the conformational freedom of the chromophore precursor, which is indicative of a defect in chromophore maturation. Together our data suggest that the mCherry Ser151 mutants may be used to report Ser mis-incorporation at multiple other codons, further expanding the ability to measure mistranslation in living cells.",

Cellular ABA levels are regulated through the combined activities of biosynthesis, catabolism, and transport proteins and depend on the developmental stage, the cell-type and on environmental conditions. Genetically encoded Förster (fluorescence) Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET)-based ABA-responsive biosensors enable the direct monitoring of ABA dynamics in intact plants. Thus, ABA biosensor-based in vivo imaging can provide novel insights about the spatiotemporal patterns of biosynthesis- and transport-dependent ABA dynamics that are required for the regulation of seed dormancy and germination, root growth and hydrotropism, and stomatal closure under water limiting conditions.

Most studies that model Mecp2 reactivation have used mouse fibroblasts rather than neural cells, which would be critical for phenotypic reversal, and rely on fluorescent reporters that lack adequate sensitivity. Here, we present a mouse model based on a dual bioluminescent and fluorescent reporter to assess the level of reactivation of Mecp2 and the inactive X chromosome by treating neural stem cells with 5-azacytidine and Xist knockdown. We show that reactivation of Mecp2 and other X-linked genes correlates with CpG density, with distance from escapees, and, very strongly, with the presence of short interspersed nuclear elements. In addition, X-linked genes reactivated in neural stem cells overlap substantially with early reactivating genes by induced pluripotent stem cell reprogramming of fibroblasts or neuronal progenitors, indicating that X chromosome reactivation follows similar paths regardless of the technique or cell type used.",

A green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expression plasmid was used as model genetic material, and fluorescence as an indicator of uptake and plasmid-derived protein expression. Three mouse and three human cell lines were incubated with a mixture of plasmid and VP-R8, and fluorescence analysis were performed two days after transfection. To confirm stable transgene expression, we performed drug selection three days after transfection. A commercially available polymer-based DNA transfection reagent (PTR) was used as the transfection control and standard for comparing transgene expression efficiency. In the case of transient transgene expression, slight-to-moderate GFP expression was observed in all cell lines transfected with plasmid via VP-R8; however, transfection efficiency was lower than using the PTR for gene delivery. In the case of stable transgene expression, VP-R8 promoted drug-resistance acquisition more efficiently than the PTR did. Cells that developed drug resistance after VP-R8-mediated gene transfection expressed GFP more efficiently than cells that developed drug resistance after transfection with the PTR.

In VSMCs, TGFβ induces IL (interleukin) 11) that stimulates ERK-dependent secretion of collagens and MMPs (matrix metalloproteinases). Here, we examined the role of IL11 in the MFS aorta. We used echocardiography, histology, immunostaining, and biochemical methods to study aortic anatomy, physiology, and molecular endophenotypes in <i>Fbn1</i><sup>C1041G/+</sup> mice, an established murine model of MFS (mMFS). mMFS mice were crossed to an IL11-tagged EGFP (enhanced green fluorescent protein; <i>Il11</i><sup>EGFP/+</sup>) reporter strain or to a strain deleted for the IL11 receptor (<i>Il11ra1</i><sup>-/-</sup>). In therapeutic studies, mMFS were administered an X209 (neutralizing antibody against IL11RA [IL11 receptor subunit alpha]) or IgG for 20 weeks and imaged longitudinally. IL11 mRNA and protein were elevated in the aortas of mMFS mice, as compared to controls. mMFS mice crossed to <i>Il11</i><sup>EGFP/+</sup> mice had increased IL11 expression in VSMCs, notably in the aortic root and ascending aorta. As compared to the mMFS parental strain, double mutant mMFS:<i>Il11ra1</i><sup>-/</sup><sup>-</sup> mice had reduced aortic dilatation and exhibited lesser fibrosis, inflammation, elastin breaks, and VSMC loss, which was associated with reduced aortic COL1A1 (collagen type I alpha 1 chain), IL11, MMP2/9, and phospho-ERK expression. To explore therapeutic targeting of IL11 signaling in MFS, we administered either a neutralizing antibody against IL11RA (X209) or an IgG control. After 20 weeks of antibody administration, as compared to IgG, mMFS mice receiving X209 had reduced thoracic and abdominal aortic dilation as well as lesser fibrosis, inflammation, elastin breaks, and VSMC loss. By immunoblotting, X209 was shown to reduce aortic COL1A1, IL11, MMP2/9, and phospho-ERK expression. In MFS, IL11 is upregulated in aortic VSMCs to cause ERK-related thoracic aortic dilatation, inflammation, and fibrosis.

However, identifying and optimizing TFs for given molecules requires extensive time and effort. Accordingly, here, we report a strategy for the de novo design of a nonnatural TF, DLA, on the basis of a subtle conformational change of the ligand-binding domain (LBD) after the binding of a target molecule with its receptor. For the de novo design of DLA, we applied molecular dynamics to simulate different conformational states of DLA in order to understand the complete activity of DLA, which involves shortening of the distance between the DNA-binding domain (DBD) and the activation domain (AD) after progesterone binds to its LBD within DLA. The simulated results suggested that prokaryotic LexA, a truncated LBD from the progesterone receptor, and prokaryotic B42 together constitute DLA with a TF function. As a proof of concept, DLA was used as a transcription activator controlling the transcription of green fluorescent protein to construct an S. cerevisiae biosensor for progesterone detection. The progesterone-specific biosensor was successfully constructed with a sensitivity index EC<sub>50</sub> of 27 μg/L, working range (0.16-60 μg/L), and time-to-detection (2.5 h). Ultimately, a low-cost, user-friendly kit was developed for the rapid detection of progesterone in the clinic.

Such issues in studying the critical transcription factor p53 have limited insight on its activity in vivo during development and tissue injury responses. Here, by linking the expression of the near-infrared fluorescent protein iRFP713 to a synthetic p53-responsive promoter, we generated a knock-in reporter mouse that enabled noninvasive, longitudinal analysis of p53 activity in vivo in response to various stimuli. In the developing embryo, this model revealed the timing and localization of p53 activation. In adult mice, the model monitored p53 activation in response to irradiation and paracetamol- or CCl<sub>4</sub>-induced liver regeneration. After irradiation, we observed potent and sustained activation of p53 in the liver, which limited the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and promoted DNA damage resolution.

Here, we developed a fluorescent protein-based c-di-GMP-sensing system for <i>Escherichia coli</i> that allowed us to visualize initial signaling events and assess the role played by the flagellar motor. The sensor was pH sensitive, and the events that appeared on a seconds' timescale were alkaline spikes in the intracellular pH.

This increase, but not the alkaline spikes, depended upon a functional flagellar motor. The kinetics and the amplitude of both the pH and c-di-GMP responses displayed cell-to-cell variability indicative of the distinct ways the cells approached and interacted with the surface.

Here, we described a new genetically stable infectious clones of a highly pathogenic PRRSV (HP-PRRSV) harboring the DsRed (a red fluorescent protein isolated from the coral <i>Discosoma</i>) gene. In the recombinant infectious clone, the transcription regulatory sequence 2 (TRS2) of PRRSV was inserted between the open reading frame 7 (ORF7) and 3'UTR to drive the transcription of DsRed gene, which makes it a separate transcription unit in the viral genome. Using the bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) system and cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter, the recombinant HP-PRRSV with the DsRed insertion was successfully rescued and showed similar growth and replication patterns compared with the wild-type virus in the MARC-145 cells. In addition, the DsRed protein was stably expressed in the recombinant virus for at least 10 passages with consistent fluorescence intensity and density. Using the recombinant HP-PRRSV with DsRed protein, the virus tracking in MARC-145 was observed by live-cell imaging. Meanwhile, quantification of the DsRed fluorescence positive cells by flow cytometry provides an alternative to standard methods for testing the level of PRRSV infection.

The frequent emergence of novel IAV strains in different hosts, including in humans, results in the need for vigilance and ongoing development of new approaches to fighting or prevent those infections. Canine influenza is a contagious respiratory disease in dogs caused by two subtypes of IAV, the equine-origin H3N8 canine influenza virus (CIV), and the avian-origin H3N2 CIV. A novel approach to influenza vaccination involves single-cycle infectious influenza A viruses (sciIAVs), which are defective for an essential viral gene. They are propagated in complementing cell lines which provide the missing gene in trans. As sciIAV cannot complete their replication cycle in regular cells they are limited to a single round of viral replication. Because of their safety profile and ability to express foreign antigens inside infected cells, sciIAVs have served both as live-attenuated vaccines and as vaccine vectors for the expression of heterologous antigens. Here, we describe experimental procedures for the generation of a single-cycle infectious CIV (sciCIV), where the viral hemagglutinin (HA) gene was exchanged for the gene for green fluorescent protein (GFP).

Here we report the first in vivo experiments using a transgenic reporter mouse for the GEVI ArcLight, which utilizes a Cre/tTA dependent expression system (TIGRE 1.0). We developed two mouse lines with ArcLight expression restricted to either olfactory receptor neurons, or a subpopulation of interneurons located in the granule and glomerular layers in the olfactory bulb. The ArcLight expression in these lines was sufficient for in vivo imaging of odorant responses in single trials using epifluorescence and 2-photon imaging. The voltage responses were odor-specific and concentration-dependent, which supported earlier studies about perceptual transformations carried out by the bulb that used calcium sensors of neural activity.

Previously, we have developed a method to measure quantitatively the intracellular concentration of hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) in living cells using genetically encoded biosensor HyPer. In the present study, we refined the method and applied it for comparing the antioxidant system potency in human cells of different phenotypes by measuring the gradient between the extracellular and cytoplasmic H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> concentrations under conditions of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced external oxidative stress. The measurements were performed using cancer cell lines (K-562 and HeLa), as well as normal human cells - all expressing HyPer in the cell cytoplasm. As normal cells, we used three isogenic lines of different phenotypes - mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs), induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from MSCs by reprogramming, and differentiated iPSC progenies with the phenotype resembling precursory MSCs. When exposing cells to exogenous H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, we showed that at low oxidative loads (<50 μM of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) the gradient depended on extracellular H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> concentration. At high loads (>50 μM of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), which caused the exhaustion of thioredoxin activity in the cell cytoplasm, the gradient stabilized, pointing out that it is the functional status of the thioredoxin-depended enzymatic system that drives the dependence of the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> gradient on the oxidative load in human cells. At high H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> concentrations, the cytoplasmic H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> level in cancer cells was found to be several hundred times lower than the extracellular one. At the same time, in normal cells, extracellular-to-intracellular gradient amounted to thousands of times. Upon reprogramming, the potency of cellular antioxidant defense increased. In contrast, differentiation of iPSCs did not result in the changes in antioxidant system activity in the cell cytoplasm, assuming that intensification of the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-detoxification processes is inherent to a period of early human development.",

        "abstract": "Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a quasi-enveloped virus with a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome belonging to the family <i>Hepeviridae</i>. Studies of the molecular aspects of HEV and drug screening have benefited from the discovery of bioluminescent reporter genes. However, the stability of large foreign genes is difficult to maintain after insertion into the viral genome. Currently, ribavirin is used to treat HEV-infected patients who require antiviral therapy. This has several major drawbacks. Thus, the development of novel anti-HEV drugs is of great importance. We developed a system consisting of recombinant infectious HEV harboring a small luciferase gene (nanoKAZ) in the hypervariable region (HVR) of the open reading frame 1 (ORF1) (HEV-nanoKAZ). It replicated efficiently in cultured cells, was genetically stable, and had morphological characteristics similar to those of the parental virus. Both membrane-associated (eHEV-nanoKAZ) and membrane-unassociated (neHEV-nanoKAZ) particles were infectious. HEV particles circulating in the bloodstream and attaching to hepatocytes in HEV-infected patients are membrane-associated; thus, eHEV-nanoKAZ was applied in drug screening. The eHEV-nanoKAZ system covers at least the inhibitor of HEV entry and inhibitor of HEV RNA replication. Four drugs with anti-HEV activity were identified. Their effectiveness in cultured cells was confirmed in naive and HEV-producing PLC/PRF/5 cells. Two hit drugs (azithromycin and ritonavir) strongly inhibited HEV production in culture supernatants, as well as intracellular expression of ORF2 protein, and may therefore be candidate novel anti-HEV drugs. The HEV-nanoKAZ system was developed and applied in drug screening and is expected to be useful for investigating the HEV life cycle. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Bioluminescent reporter viruses are essential tools in molecular virological research. They have been widely used to investigate viral life cycles and in the development of antiviral drugs. For drug screening, the use of a bioluminescent reporter virus helps shorten the time required to perform the assay. A system, consisting of recombinant infectious HEV harboring the nanoKAZ gene in the HVR of ORF1 (HEV-nanoKAZ), was developed in this study and was successfully applied to drug screening in which four hit drugs with anti-HEV activity were identified. The results of this study provide evidence supporting the use of this system in more variable HEV studies. In addition, both forms of viral particles (eHEV-nanoKAZ and neHEV-nanoKAZ) are infectious, which will enable their application in HEV studies requiring both forms of viral particles, such as in the investigation of unknown HEV receptors and the elucidation of host factors important for HEV entry.",

Here we demonstrate a high-throughput adaptable method using genetically encoded fluorescent probes for the real-time quantitative detection of cell death and cell cycle. The cell-cycle indicator cdt1-Kusabira orange (KO) is stably integrated into cancer cells and further transfected with the Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer-based ECFP-DEVD-EYFP caspase activation sensor. The nuclear cdt1-KO expression serves as the readout for cell-cycle, and caspase activation is visualized by ECFP/EYFP ratiometric imaging. The image-based platform allowed imaging of growing spheres for prolonged periods in 3D-culture with excellent single-cell resolution through confocal microscopy. High-throughput screening (HTS) adaptation was achieved by targeting the caspase-sensor at the nucleus, which enabled the quantitation of cell death in 3D-models.

It is a function-based metagenomic screening tool that relies on transcriptional activation of a reporter gene <i>green fluorescence protein</i> (<i>gfp</i>) by a metagenomic DNA library upon induction with a substrate. However, its use is limited because of the relatively small size of metagenomic DNA libraries and incompatibility with screening metagenomes from anaerobic environments. In this study, these limitations of SIGEX were addressed by fine-tuning metagenome DNA library construction protocol and by using Evoglow, a green fluorescent protein that forms a chromophore even under anaerobic conditions. Two metagenomic libraries were constructed for subseafloor sediments offshore Shimokita Peninsula (Pacific Ocean) and offshore Joetsu (Japan Sea). The library construction protocol was improved by (a) eliminating short DNA fragments, (b) applying topoisomerase-based high-efficiency ligation, (c) optimizing insert DNA concentration, and (d) column-based DNA enrichment. This led to a successful construction of metagenome DNA libraries of approximately 6 Gbp for both samples. SIGEX screening using five aromatic compounds (benzoate, 3-chlorobenzoate, 3-hydroxybenzoate, phenol, and 2,4-dichlorophenol) under aerobic and anaerobic conditions revealed significant differences in the inducible clone ratios under these conditions. 3-Chlorobenzoate and 2,4-dichlorophenol led to a higher induction ratio than that for the other non-chlorinated aromatic compounds under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. After the further screening of induced clones, a clone induced by 3-chlorobenzoate only under anaerobic conditions was isolated and characterized. The clone harbors a DNA insert that encodes putative open reading frames of unknown function. Previous aerobic SIGEX attempts succeeded in the isolation of gene fragments from anaerobes. This study demonstrated that some gene fragments require a strict <i>in vivo</i> reducing environment to function and may be potentially missed when screened by aerobic induction.

To improve the classification of aneugenic substances and determine their MOA, we developed and validated the TubulinTracker assay that uses a green fluorescent protein-tagged tubulin reporter cell line to study microtubule stability using flow cytometry. Combining the assay with a DNA stain also enables cell cycle analysis. Substances whose exposure resulted in an accumulation of cells in G2/M phase, combined with increased or decreased tubulin levels, were classified as tubulin poisons. All known tubulin poisons included were classified correctly. Moreover, we correctly classified compounds, including aneugens that did not affect microtubule levels. However, the MOA of aneugens not affecting tubulin stability, such as Aurora kinase inhibitors, could not be identified. Here, we show that the TubulinTracker assay can be used to classify microtubule stabilizing and destabilizing compounds in living cells.

Although a large number of biosensors have been developed, the fine-tuning of their dose-response curves, which promotes the applications of biosensors in various scenarios, still remains challenging. To address this issue, we leverage a DNA trackable assembly method and fluorescence-activated cell sorting coupled with next-generation sequencing (FACS-seq) technology to set up a novel workflow for construction and comprehensive characterization of thousands of biosensors in a massively parallel manner. An FapR-<i>fapO-</i>based malonyl-CoA biosensor was used as proof of concept to construct a trackable combinatorial library, containing 5184 combinations with 6 levels of transcription factor dosage, 4 different operator positions, and 216 possible upstream enhancer sequence (UAS) designs. By applying the FACS-seq technique, the response curves of 2632 biosensors out of 5184 combinations were successfully characterized to provide large-scale genotype-phenotype association data of the designed biosensors. Finally, machine-learning algorithms were applied to predict the genotype-phenotype relationships of the uncharacterized combinations to generate a panoramic scanning map of the combinatorial space. With the assistance of our novel workflow, a malonyl-CoA biosensor with the largest dynamic response range was successfully obtained. Moreover, feature importance analysis revealed that the recognition sequence insertion scheme and the choice of UAS have a significant impact on the dynamic range. Taken together, our pipeline provides a platform for the design, tuning, and profiling of biosensor response curves and shows great potential to facilitate the rational design of genetic circuits.",

A DNA origami plate is equipped with modifications for specific membrane targeting, surface immobilization, and an anionic sensing unit consisting of single-stranded DNA and the dye ATTO542. This unit is anchored to a lipid membrane by the dye ATTO647N, and conformational changes of the sensing unit in response to surface charges are read out by fluorescence resonance energy transfer between the two dyes. We test the performance of our sensor with single-molecule fluorescence microscopy by exposing it to differently charged large unilamellar vesicles. We achieve a change in energy transfer of ∼10% points between uncharged and highly charged membranes and demonstrate a quantitative relation between the surface charge and the energy transfer. Further, with autocorrelation analyses of confocal data, we unravel the working principle of our sensor that is switching dynamically between a membrane-bound state and an unbound state on the timescale of 1-10 ms.

NHE3 and DRA are highly regulated by changes in second messengers, cAMP, cGMP and Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Precise and convenient measurement of exchanger activity is necessary to allow rapid study of physiologic and pharmacologic functions. Some epithelial cells are difficult to load with AM ester dyes and loading may not be uniform. The use of a genetically modified fluorescent protein, mOrange2 was explored as an intracellular pH sensor protein to measure exchange activity of NHE3 and DRA. The model used was FRT cells stably expressing NHE3 or DRA with intracellular pH measured by changes of mOrange2 fluorescence intensity. Intracellular pH was monitored using a) Isolated single clones of FRT/mOrange2/HA-NHE3 cells studied in a confocal microscope with time-lapse live cell imaging under basal conditions and when NHE3 was inhibited by exposure to forskolin and stimulated by dexamethasone, b) coverslip grown FRT/mOrange2 cells expressing NHE3 or DRA using a computerized fluorometer with a perfused cuvette with standardization of the mOrange2 absorption and emission signal using K<sup>+</sup>/Nigericin as an internal standard in each experiment. A similar rate of intracellular alkalization by Na<sup>+</sup> addition in cells expressing NHE3 and by Cl<sup>-</sup> removal in cells expressing DRA was found in mOrange2 expressing cells compared to the same cells loaded with BCECF-AM, both using the same pH calibration with K<sup>+</sup>/Nigericin. Using mOrange2 as the pH sensor, NHE3 basal activity was quantitated and shown to be inhibited by forskolin and stimulated by dexamethasone, and DRA was oppositely shown to be stimulated by forskolin, responses similar to results found using BCECF-AM. This study demonstrates that mOrange2 protein can be an effective alternate to BCECF-AM in measuring intracellular pH (preferred setting Ex520nm, Em 563nm) as affected by NHE3 and DRA activity, with the advantage, compared to AM ester dyes, that genetic expression can provide uniform expression of the pH sensor.",

Genetically encoded biosensors have emerged as promising tools and have been used to improve microbial productivity and tolerance toward industrially relevant stresses. Here, fluorescent biosensors able to sense the yeast intracellular environment (pH, ATP levels, oxidative stress, glycolytic flux, and ribosome production) were implemented into a versatile and easy-to-use toolbox. Marker-free and efficient genome integration at a conserved site on chromosome X of Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains and a commercial Saccharomyces boulardii strain was developed. Moreover, multiple biosensors were used to simultaneously monitor different intracellular parameters in a single cell. Even when combined together, the biosensors did not significantly affect key physiological parameters, such as specific growth rate and product yields. Activation and response of each biosensor and their interconnection were assessed using an advanced micro-cultivation system. Finally, the toolbox was used to screen cell behavior in a synthetic lignocellulosic hydrolysate that mimicked harsh industrial substrates, revealing differences in the oxidative stress response between laboratory (CEN.PK113-7D) and industrial (Ethanol Red) S. cerevisiae strains. In summary, the toolbox will allow both the exploration of yeast diversity and physiological responses in natural and complex industrial conditions, as well as the possibility to monitor production processes.",

The reasons for potential differences in PaHV2 and McHV1 pathogenicity are presently not understood, and answering these questions will require mutagenic analysis. Here, we report the development of a recombinant system, which allows rescue of recombinant PaHV2. In addition, we used recombineering to generate viruses carrying reporter genes (Gaussia luciferase or enhanced green fluorescent protein), which replicate with similar efficiency as wild-type PaHV2. We demonstrate that these viruses can be used to analyze susceptibility of cells to infection and inhibition of infection by neutralizing antibodies and antiviral compounds. In summary, we created a recombinant system for PaHV2, which in the future will be invaluable for molecular analyses of neuropathogenicity of PaHV2.",

The purpose of this study was to identify genes that are significantly upregulated in the early stage of DN progression and develop a novel model to non-invasively monitor disease progression within living animals using in vivo imaging technology. Streptozotocin (STZ) treatment has been widely used as a DN model; however, it also exhibits direct cytotoxicity to the kidneys. As it is important to distinguish between DN-related and STZ-induced nephropathy, in this study, we compared renal responses induced by the diabetic milieu with two types of STZ models: multiple low-dose STZ injections with a high-fat diet and two moderate-dose STZ injections to induce DN. We found 221 genes whose expression was significantly altered during DN development in both models and identified serum amyloid A3 (<i>Saa3</i>) as a candidate gene. Next, we applied the Saa3 promoter-driven luciferase reporter (Saa3-promoter luc mice) to these two STZ models and performed in vivo bioluminescent imaging to monitor the progression of renal pathology. In this study, to further exclude the possibility that the in vivo bioluminescence signal is related to renal cytotoxicity by STZ treatment, we injected insulin into Saa3-promoter luc mice and showed that insulin treatment could downregulate renal inflammatory responses with a decreased signal intensity of in vivo bioluminescence imaging.

A<sub>1</sub>Rs on other striatal neurons are activated by an adenosine tone that is limited by equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 (ENT1) that is enriched on astrocytes and is ethanol sensitive. We explored whether dopamine release in nucleus accumbens core is under tonic inhibition by A<sub>1</sub>Rs, and is regulated by astrocytic ENT1 and ethanol. In <i>ex vivo</i> striatal slices from male and female mice, A<sub>1</sub>R agonists inhibited dopamine release evoked electrically or optogenetically and detected using fast-scan cyclic voltammetry, most strongly for lower stimulation frequencies and pulse numbers, thereby enhancing the activity-dependent contrast of dopamine release. Conversely, A<sub>1</sub>R antagonists reduced activity-dependent contrast but enhanced evoked dopamine release levels, even for single optogenetic pulses indicating an underlying tonic inhibition. The ENT1 inhibitor nitrobenzylthioinosine reduced dopamine release and promoted A<sub>1</sub>R-mediated inhibition, and, conversely, virally mediated astrocytic overexpression of ENT1 enhanced dopamine release and relieved A<sub>1</sub>R-mediated inhibition. By imaging the genetically encoded fluorescent adenosine sensor [GPCR-activation based (GRAB)-Ado], we identified a striatal extracellular adenosine tone that was elevated by the ENT1 inhibitor and sensitive to gliotoxin fluorocitrate. Finally, we identified that ethanol (50 mm) promoted A<sub>1</sub>R-mediated inhibition of dopamine release, through diminishing adenosine uptake via ENT1. Together, these data reveal that dopamine output dynamics are gated by a striatal adenosine tone, limiting amplitude but promoting contrast, regulated by ENT1, and promoted by ethanol. These data add to the diverse mechanisms through which ethanol modulates striatal dopamine, and to emerging datasets supporting astrocytic transporters as important regulators of striatal function.<b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Dopamine axons in the mammalian striatum are emerging as strategic sites where neuromodulators can powerfully influence dopamine output in health and disease. We found that ambient levels of the neuromodulator adenosine tonically inhibit dopamine release in nucleus accumbens core via adenosine A<sub>1</sub> receptors (A<sub>1</sub>Rs), to a variable level that promotes the contrast in dopamine signals released by different frequencies of activity. We reveal that the equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 (ENT1) on astrocytes limits this tonic inhibition, and that ethanol promotes it by diminishing adenosine uptake via ENT1. These findings support the hypotheses that A<sub>1</sub>Rs on dopamine axons inhibit dopamine release and, furthermore, that astrocytes perform important roles in setting the level of striatal dopamine output, in health and disease.",

C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) stimulates endochondral bone formation through binding to its specific receptor, guanylyl cyclase (GC)-B. However, CNP/GC-B signaling dynamics in different stages of endochondral bone formation have not been fully clarified, especially in terms of the interaction between the cyclic guanine monophosphate (cGMP) and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) pathways. Here, we demonstrated that CNP activates the cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA) pathway and that this activation contributed to the elongation of the hypertrophic zone in the growth plate. Cells of the chondrogenic line ATDC5 were transfected with Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based cGMP and PKA biosensors. Dual-FRET imaging revealed that CNP increased intracellular cGMP levels and PKA activities in chondrocytes. Further, CNP-induced PKA activation was enhanced following differentiation of ATDC5 cells. Live imaging of the fetal growth plate of transgenic mice, expressing a FRET biosensor for PKA, PKAchu mice, showed that CNP predominantly activates the PKA in the hypertrophic chondrocytes. Additionally, histological analysis of the growth plate of PKAchu mice demonstrated that CNP increased the length of the growth plate, but coadministration of a PKA inhibitor, H89, inhibited the growth-promoting effect of CNP only in the hypertrophic zone. In summary, we revealed that CNP-induced cGMP elevation activated the cAMP/PKA pathway, and clarified that this PKA activation contributed to the bone growth-promoting effect of CNP in hypertrophic chondrocytes. These results provide insights regarding the cross-talk between cGMP and cAMP signaling in endochondral bone formation and in the physiological role of the CNP/GC-B system.",

        "abstract": "Protein aggregation is a biological phenomenon in which aberrantly processed or mutant proteins misfold and assemble into a variety of insoluble aggregates. Decades of studies have delineated the structure, interaction, and activity of proteins in either their natively folded structures or insoluble aggregates such as amyloid fibrils. However, a variety of intermediate species exist between these two extreme states in the protein folding landscape. Herein, we collectively term these intermediate species as misfolded protein oligomers, including soluble oligomers and preamyloid oligomers that are formed by unfolded or misfolded proteins. While extensive tools have been developed to study folded proteins or amyloid fibrils, research to understand the properties and activities of misfolded protein oligomers has been limited by the lack of methods to detect and interrogate these species in live cells.In this Account, we describe our efforts in the development of chemical methods that allow for the characterization of the multistep protein aggregation process, in particular the misfolded protein oligomers, in living cells. As the start of this journey, we attempted to develop a fluorogenic method wherein the misfolded oligomers could turn on the fluorescence of chemical probes that are conjugated to the protein-of-interest (POI). To this end, we produced a series of destabilized HaloTag variants, formulating the primary component of the AgHalo sensor, which misfolds and aggregates when cells are subjected to stress. When AgHalo is covalently conjugated with a solvatochromic fluorophore, misfolding of the AgHalo conjugate would activate fluorescence, resulting in the observation of misfolded oligomers. Following this work, we extended the scope of detection from AgHalo to any protein-of-interest via the AggTag method, wherein the POIs are genetically fused to self-labeling protein tags (HaloTag or SNAP-tag). Focusing on the molecular rotor-based fluorophores, we applied the modulated fluorescent protein (FP) chromophore core as a prototype for the AggTag probes, to enable the fluorogenic detection of misfolded soluble oligomers of multiple proteins in live cells. Next, we further developed the AggTag method to distinguish insoluble aggregates from misfolded oligomers, using two classes of probes that activate different fluorescence emission toward these two conformations. To enable this goal, we applied physical organic chemistry and computational chemistry to discover a new category of triode-like fluorophores, wherein the π orbitals of either an electron density regulator or the donor-acceptor linkages are used to control the rotational barriers of fluorophores in the excited states. This mechanism allows us to rationally design molecular rotor-based fluorophores that have desired responses to viscosity, thus extending the application of the AggTag method.In summary, our work allows the direct monitoring of the misfolded protein oligomers and differentiation of insoluble aggregates from other conformations in live cells, thus enabling studies of many currently unanswered questions in protein aggregation. Future directions are to develop methods that enable quantitative analyses of the protein aggregation process. Further, new methods are needed to detect and to quantify the formation and maturation of protein or RNA condensates that form membraneless organelles.",

In atrial myocytes we previously identified a constitutively increased ryanodine receptor (RyR2) phosphorylation at junctional Ca<sup>2+</sup> release sites, whereas non-junctional RyR2 clusters were phosphorylated acutely following β-adrenergic stimulation. Here, we hypothesized that the baseline synthesis of 3',5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) is constitutively augmented in the axial tubule junctional compartments of atrial myocytes. Confocal immunofluorescence imaging of atrial myocytes revealed that junctin, binding to RyR2 in the sarcoplasmic reticulum, was densely clustered at axial tubule junctions. Interestingly, a new transgenic junctin-targeted FRET cAMP biosensor was exclusively co-clustered in the junctional compartment, and hence allowed to monitor cAMP selectively in the vicinity of junctional RyR2 channels. To dissect local cAMP levels at axial tubule junctions versus subsurface Ca<sup>2+</sup> release sites, we developed a confocal FRET imaging technique for living atrial myocytes. A constitutively high adenylyl cyclase activity sustained increased local cAMP levels at axial tubule junctions, whereas β-adrenergic stimulation overcame this cAMP compartmentation resulting in additional phosphorylation of non-junctional RyR2 clusters. Adenylyl cyclase inhibition, however, abolished the junctional RyR2 phosphorylation and decreased L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel currents, while FRET imaging showed a rapid cAMP decrease. In conclusion, FRET biosensor imaging identified compartmentalized, constitutively augmented cAMP levels in junctional dyads, driving both the locally increased phosphorylation of RyR2 clusters and larger L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> current density in atrial myocytes. This cell-specific cAMP nanodomain is maintained by a constitutively increased adenylyl cyclase activity, contributing to the rapid junctional Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> release, whereas β-adrenergic stimulation overcomes the junctional cAMP compartmentation through cell-wide activation of non-junctional RyR2 clusters.",

        "abstract": "The bacteriocin nisin is naturally produced by Lactococcus lactis as an inactive prepeptide that is modified posttranslationally resulting in five (methyl-)lanthionine rings characteristic for class Ia bacteriocins. Export and proteolytic cleavage of the leader peptide results in release of active nisin. By targeting the universal peptidoglycan precursor lipid II, nisin has a broad target spectrum including important human pathogens such as Listeria monocytogenes and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains. Industrial nisin production is currently performed using natural producer strains resulting in rather low product purity and limiting its application to preservation of dairy food products. We established heterologous nisin production using the biotechnological workhorse organism Corynebacterium glutamicum in a two-step process. We demonstrate successful biosynthesis and export of fully modified prenisin and its activation to mature nisin by a purified, soluble variant of the nisin protease NisP (sNisP) produced in Escherichia coli. Active nisin was detected by a L. lactis sensor strain with strictly nisin-dependent expression of the fluorescent protein mCherry. Following activation by sNisP, supernatants of the recombinant C. glutamicum producer strain cultivated in standard batch fermentations contained at least 1.25 mg/l active nisin. We demonstrate successful implementation of a two-step process for recombinant production of active nisin with C. glutamicum. This extends the spectrum of bioactive compounds that may be produced using C. glutamicum to a bacteriocin harboring complex posttranslational modifications. Our results provide a basis for further studies to optimize product yields, transfer production to sustainable substrates and purification of pharmaceutical grade nisin.",

        "abstract": "Protein conformational switches are widely used in biosensing. They are often composed of an input domain (which binds a target ligand) fused to an output domain (which generates an optical readout). A central challenge in designing such switches is to develop mechanisms for coupling the input and output signals <i>via</i> conformational changes. Here, we create a biosensor in which binding-induced folding of the input domain drives a conformational shift in the output domain that results in a sixfold green-to-yellow ratiometric fluorescence change <i>in vitro</i> and a 35-fold intensiometric fluorescence increase in cultured cells. The input domain consists of circularly permuted FK506 binding protein (cpFKBP) that folds upon binding its target ligand (FK506 or rapamycin). cpFKBP folding induces the output domain, an engineered green fluorescent protein (GFP) variant, to replace one of its β-strands (containing T203 and specifying green fluorescence) with a duplicate β-strand (containing Y203 and specifying yellow fluorescence) in an intramolecular exchange reaction. This mechanism employs the loop-closure entropy principle, embodied by the folding of the partially disordered cpFKBP domain, to couple ligand binding to the GFP color shift. This study highlights the high-energy barriers present in GFP folding which cause β-strand exchange to be slow and are also likely responsible for the shift from the β-strand exchange mechanism <i>in vitro</i> to ligand-induced chromophore maturation in cells. The proof-of-concept design has the advantages of full genetic encodability and potential for modularity. The latter attribute is enabled by the natural coupling of binding and folding and circular permutation of the input domain, which theoretically allows different binding domains to be compatible for insertion into the GFP surface loop.",

While glandular trichomes of cultivated tomato <i>Solanum lycopersicum</i> primarily accumulate a blend of monoterpenes, those of the wild tomato species <i>Solanum habrochaites</i> produce various sesquiterpenes. Recently, we have identified two groups of sesquiterpenes in <i>S. habrochaites</i> accessions that negatively affect the performance and choice behavior of the potato aphid (<i>Macrosiphum euphorbiae</i>). Aphids are piercing-sucking herbivores that use their mouthpart to penetrate and probe plant tissues in order to ultimately access vascular tissue and ingest phloem sap. Because secondary metabolites produced in glandular trichomes can affect the initial steps of the aphid feeding behavior, introducing the formation of defensive terpenes into additional plant tissues <i>via</i> metabolic engineering has the potential to reduce tissue penetration by aphids and in consequence virus transmission. Here, we have developed two multicistronic expression constructs based on the two sesquiterpene traits with activity toward <i>M. euphorbiae</i> previously identified in <i>S. habrochaites</i>. Both constructs are composed of sequences encoding a prenyl transferase and a respective <i>S. habrochaites</i> terpene synthase, as well as enhanced green fluorescent protein as a visible marker. All three coding sequences were linked by short nucleotide sequences encoding the foot-and-mouth disease virus 2A self-processing oligopeptide which allows their co-expression under the control of one promoter. Transient expression of both constructs under the epidermis-specific <i>Arabidopsis CER5</i>-promoter in tomato leaves demonstrated that formation of the two sets of defensive sesquiterpenes, β-caryophyllene/α-humulene and (-)-<i>endo</i>-α-bergamotene/(+)-α-santalene/(+)-<i>endo</i>-β-bergamotene, can be introduced into new tissues in tomato. The epidermis-specific transgene expression and terpene formation were verified by fluorescence microscopy and tissue fractionation with subsequent analysis of terpene profiles, respectively. In addition, the longevity and fecundity of <i>M. euphorbiae</i> feeding on these engineered tomato leaves were significantly reduced, demonstrating the efficacy of this novel aphid control strategy.",

The lack of highly efficient gene transfer techniques, which, furthermore, are applied in multicellular explants such as somatic embryos, are additional technical handicaps to gene editing in the vine. The inclusion of geminivirus-based replicons in regular T-DNA vectors can enhance the expression of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (CRISPR/Cas9) elements, thus enabling the use of these multicellular explants as starting materials. In this study, we used <i>Bean yellow dwarf virus</i> (BeYDV)-derived replicon vectors to express the key components of CRISPR/Cas9 system <i>in vivo</i> and evaluate their editing capability in individuals derived from <i>Agrobacterium</i>-mediated gene transfer experiments of 'Thompson Seedless' somatic embryos. Preliminary assays using a BeYDV-derived vector for <i>green fluorescent protein</i> reporter gene expression demonstrated marker visualization in embryos for up to 33 days post-infiltration. A universal BeYDV-based vector (pGMV-U) was assembled to produce all CRISPR/Cas9 components with up to four independent guide RNA (gRNA) expression cassettes. With a focus on fungal tolerance, we used gRNA pairs to address considerably large deletions of putative grape susceptibility genes, including <i>AUXIN INDUCED IN ROOT CULTURE 12</i> (<i>VviAIR12</i>), <i>SUGARS WILL EVENTUALLY BE EXPORTED TRANSPORTER 4</i> (<i>VviSWEET4</i>), <i>LESION INITIATION 2</i> (<i>VviLIN2</i>), and <i>DIMERIZATION PARTNER-E2F-LIKE 1</i> (<i>VviDEL1</i>). The editing functionality of gRNA pairs in pGMV-U was evaluated by grapevine leaf agroinfiltration assays, thus enabling longer-term embryo transformations. These experiments allowed for the establishment of greenhouse individuals exhibiting a double-cut edited status for all targeted genes under different allele-editing conditions. After approximately 18 months, the edited grapevine plants were preliminary evaluated regarding its resistance to <i>Erysiphe necator</i> and <i>Botrytis cinerea</i>. Assays have shown that a transgene-free <i>VviDEL1</i> double-cut edited line exhibits over 90% reduction in symptoms triggered by powdery mildew infection.

We used transgenic mice with CB2 promoter-driven expression of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) to study cell types that express CB2 and suppress neuropathic nociception in a mouse model of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy. Structurally distinct CB2 agonists (AM1710 and LY2828360) suppressed paclitaxel-induced mechanical and cold allodynia in CB2EGFP reporter mice with established neuropathy. Antiallodynic effects of AM1710 were blocked by SR144528, a CB2 antagonist with limited CNS penetration. Intraplantar AM1710 administration suppressed paclitaxel-induced neuropathic nociception in CB2EGFP but not CB2 knockout mice, consistent with a local site of antiallodynic action. mRNA expression levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 were elevated in the lumbar spinal cord after intraplantar AM1710 injection along with the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha and chemokine monocyte chemoattractant protein-1. CB2EGFP, but not wildtype mice, exhibited anti-GFP immunoreactivity in the spleen. However, the anti-GFP signal was below the threshold for detection in the spinal cord and brain of either vehicle-treated or paclitaxel-treated CB2EGFP mice. EGFP fluorescence was coexpressed with CB2 immunolabeling in stratified patterns among epidermal keratinocytes. EGFP fluorescence was also expressed in dendritic cells in the dermis, Langerhans cells in the epidermis, and Merkel cells. Quantification of the EGFP signal revealed that Langerhans cells were dynamically increased in the epidermis after paclitaxel treatment.

The model green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii has already been used to generate high value bioproducts such as recombinant proteins and terpenoids. However, low, unstable, and variable nuclear transgene expression has limited the ease and speed of metabolic engineering and recombinant protein expression in this system. Here, novel genetic devices for transgene expression in C. reinhardtii have been developed by identifying cis-regulatory DNA elements capable of driving high transgene expression in C. reinhardtii promoters using de novo motif discovery informatics approaches. Thirteen putative motifs were synthesized as concatemers, linked to a common minimal basal promoter, and assayed for their activity to drive expression of a yellow fluorescent protein reporter gene. Following transformation of the vectors into C. reinhardtii by electroporation, in vivo measurements of yellow fluorescent protein expression by flow cytometry revealed that five of the DNA motifs analyzed displayed significantly higher reporter expression compared to the basal promoter control. Two of the concatemerized motifs, despite being much smaller minimal cis-regulatory elements, drove reporter expression at levels approaching that of the conventionally-used AR1 promoter. This analysis provides insight into C. reinhardtii promoter structure and gene regulation, and provides a new toolbox of cis-regulatory elements that can be used to drive transgene expression at a variety of expression levels.",

Preclinical and clinical studies have demonstrated that adeno-associated viral vectors are the most attractive vehicles for gene transfer.

The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of the first synthetic adeno-associated viral lineage clone, Anc80L65, for cardiac gene therapy. By combining 2 different reporter approaches by fluorescence with green fluorescent protein and bioluminescence (Firefly luciferase), we compared transduction efficiency of Anc80L65 and adeno-associated virus, serotype 9 in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes ex vivo and rat hearts in vivo after intramyocardial and intracoronary administration. In cardiomyocytes, Anc80L65 provided a green fluorescent protein expression of 28.9% (36.4 ± 3.34 cells/field) at 24 hours and approximately 100% on day 7. In contrast, adeno-associated virus, serotype 9 green fluorescent protein provided minimal green fluorescent protein expression of 5.64% at 24 hours and 11.8% on day 7. After intramyocardial injection, vector expression peaked on day 7 with Anc80L65; however, with adeno-associated virus, serotype 9 the peak expression was during week 6. Administration of Anc80L65 demonstrated significantly more efficient expression of reporter gene than after adeno-associated virus, serotype 9 at 6 weeks (6.81 ± 0.64 log<sup>10</sup> gc/100 ng DNA vs 6.49 ± 0.28 log<sup>10</sup> gc/100 ng DNA, P < .05). These results were consistent with the amount of genome copy per cell observed in the heart.

Using our toolkit, we tested whether V1 optogenetic stimulation can recapitulate the perceptual masking effect of a visual mask. We find that, similar to a visual mask, low-power optostimulation can significantly reduce visual detection sensitivity, that a sublinear interaction between visual- and optogenetic-evoked V1 responses could account for this perceptual effect, and that these neural and behavioral effects are spatially selective.

The situation is further compounded by the lack of an approved vaccine or antiviral drug. Herein, we investigated a novel anti-ASFV approach by targeting G-Quadruplexes (G4s) in the viral genome. Bioinformatics analysis of putative G-quadruplex-forming sequences (PQSs) in the genome of ASFV BA71V strain revealed 317 PQSs on the forward strand and 322 PQSs on the reverse strand of the viral genome, translating to a density of 3.82 PQSs/kb covering 9.52% of the entire genome, which means that 85% of genes in the ASFV genome have at least 1 PQS on either strand. Biochemical characterization showed that 8 out of 13 conserved PQSs could form stable G4s in the presence of K<sup>+</sup>, and 4 of them could be stabilized by G4 ligands, N-Methyl Mesoporphyrin (NMM), and pyridostatin (PDS) <i>in vitro</i>. An enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-based reporter system revealed that the expression of two G4-containing genes, i.e., P1192R and D117L, could be significantly suppressed by NMM and PDS in 293T cells. In addition, a virus infection model showed that NMM could inhibit the replication of ASFV in Porcine Alveolar Macrophages (PAM) cells with an EC<sub>50</sub> value of 1.16 μM. Altogether, the present study showed that functional PQSs existent in the promoters, CDS, 3' and 5' UTRs of the ASFV genome could be stabilized by G4 ligands, such as NMM and PDS, and could serve as potential targets for antivirals.",

During the past two decades, both genotypes I (G) and III (GIII) JEVs co-existed in many Asian countries, and the prevalent strains have shifted from GIII to GI. Since all licensed JE vaccines are derived from GIII strains and no specific treatment is available, the development of novel vaccines and specific antiviral drugs against both genotypes is urgently required. To solve the unstable issue of the JEV infectious cDNA clone and establish a reliable antiviral screening assay, we established the yeast artificial chromosome (YAC)-based reverse genetics systems for GI and GIII JEV strains through transformation-associated recombination (TAR) technology in yeast. The YAC-based infectious clones of GI and GIII JEV exhibited high genetic stability both in yeast and E. coli. Using these reverse genetics systems, recombinant EGFP-reporter viruses were generated and remained stable for at least 10 passages in vitro. An image-based antiviral assay for JEV was developed with the EGFP-reporter viruses, and two drugs were identified to have a broad-spectrum inhibitory effect on GI and GIII JEV replication, which provide potential new therapeutic for the treatment of multiple genotypes JEV infection.",

Errors in these processes can lead to aneuploidy, which is a hallmark of cancer. Understanding the mechanisms that drive spindle assembly will provide fundamental insights into how accurate chromosome segregation is achieved. One challenge in elucidating the complexities of spindle assembly is to visualize protein interactions in space and time. The Xenopus egg extract system has been a valuable tool to probe protein function during spindle assembly in vitro. Tagging proteins with fluorescent proteins and utilizing fluorescence-based approaches, such as Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) and fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM), have provided visual clues about the mechanics of spindle assembly and its regulators. However, elucidating how spindle assembly factors are spatially regulated is still challenging. Combining the egg extract system and visual FRET approaches provides a powerful tool to probe the processes involved in spindle assembly. Here we describe how a FLIM-FRET biosensor can be used to study protein-protein interactions in spindles assembled in Xenopus egg extracts. This approach should be readily adaptable to a wide variety of proteins to allow for new insights into the regulation of spindle assembly.",

The film and its holder are inserted into a 3D-printed housing cylinder to connect to a pump. The device has an open channel design, creating virtually no pressure drop, which allows for longer sampling times on the same battery charge compared to filter samplers.

To identify the domains critical for zygote/ookinete development, transgenic parasites expressing partially deleted Pb103 were generated and assayed for ookinete maturation.

While SV2A is required for normal levels of evoked neurotransmitter release, the mechanism underlying this role remains unclear. Here, we introduce a new chemogenetic approach for all-optical monitoring of excitation-secretion coupling, and we demonstrate its use in characterizing the SV2A knockout (KO) phenotype in cultured hippocampal neurons. This method employs the HaloTag system to target a robust small-molecule Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator, JF<sub>646</sub> -BAPTA, to the presynaptic compartment. The far-red fluorescence of this indicator enables multiplexing with the fluorescent glutamate sensor iGluSnFR for detection of presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and glutamate release at the same axonal boutons. Evoked glutamate release probability was reduced in SV2A KO neurons without a change in presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry, suggesting that SV2A supports vesicle fusion by increasing the functional availability, or efficiency, of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> -regulated membrane fusion machinery. KEY POINTS: One of the most prescribed antiepileptic medications, levetiracetam, acts by binding a protein of uncertain molecular function. This transporter-like protein, SV2A, is trafficked to synaptic vesicles and acts to support neurotransmitter release, but the mechanism underlying this function has not been determined In this study, we sought to establish whether SV2A changes Ca<sup>2+</sup> signalling at nerve terminals, which is a key regulatory system for synaptic vesicle exocytosis. To do so, we adapted new chemogenetic tools to perform all-optical measurements of presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> and glutamate release in neurons lacking SV2A. Our measurements showed that loss of SV2A reduces glutamate release without reducing Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx at hippocampal nerve terminals, demonstrating that SV2A increases the likelihood that Ca<sup>2+</sup> will trigger synaptic vesicle fusion.",

The demand for animal-based food products (meat, milk, and eggs) is increasing, and therefore faster methods are necessary to detect infected animals or contaminated food before products enter the market. However, conventional detection is based on time-consuming microbial cultivation methods. Here, the establishment of a quorum sensing-based method for detection of foodborne pathogens as <i>Yersinia enterocolitica</i> in a co-cultivation approach using a bacterial biosensor carrying a special sensor plasmid is described. We combined selective enrichment with the simultaneous detection of pathogens by recording autoinducer-1-induced bioluminescent response of the biosensor. This new approach enables real-time detection with a calculated sensitivity of one initial cell in a sample after 15.3 h of co-cultivation, while higher levels of initial contamination can be detected within less than half of the time. Our new method is substantially faster than conventional microbial cultivation and should be transferrable to other zoonotic foodborne pathogens. As we could demonstrate, quorum sensing is a promising platform for the development of sensitive assays in the area of food quality, safety, and hygiene.",

        "abstract": "The single-photon timing and sensitivity performance and the imaging ability of asynchronous-readout single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) array detectors have opened up enormous perspectives in fluorescence (lifetime) laser scanning microscopy (FLSM), such as super-resolution image scanning microscopy and high-information content fluorescence fluctuation spectroscopy. However, the strengths of these FLSM techniques depend on the many different characteristics of the detector, such as dark noise, photon-detection efficiency, after-pulsing probability, and optical cross talk, whose overall optimization is typically a trade-off between these characteristics. To mitigate this trade-off, we present, to our knowledge, a novel SPAD array detector with an active cooling system that substantially reduces the dark noise without significantly deteriorating any other detector characteristics. In particular, we show that lowering the temperature of the sensor to -15°C significantly improves the signal/noise ratio due to a 10-fold decrease in the dark count rate compared with room temperature. As a result, for imaging, the laser power can be decreased by more than a factor of three, which is particularly beneficial for live-cell super-resolution imaging, as demonstrated in fixed and living cells expressing green-fluorescent-protein-tagged proteins. For fluorescence fluctuation spectroscopy, together with the benefit of the reduced laser power, we show that cooling the detector is necessary to remove artifacts in the correlation function, such as spurious negative correlations observed in the hot elements of the detector, i.e., elements for which dark noise is substantially higher than the median value. Overall, this detector represents a further step toward the integration of SPAD array detectors in any FLSM system.",

Squash exhibits markedly improved in-cell folding and highly efficient metabolite-dependent folding when fused to a S-adenosylmethionine (SAM)-binding aptamer. A Squash-based ratiometric sensor achieved quantitative SAM measurements, revealed cell-to-cell heterogeneity in SAM levels and revealed metabolic origins of SAM.

The biosensor \"tpMetROG\" consists of methionine sulfoxide reductase B (MsrB), circularly permuted yellow fluorescent protein (cpYFP), thioredoxin, and protein G. Protein G binds to the constant region of antibodies against target proteins, specifically capturing them. Then, MsrB reduces the oxidized methionine in these proteins, leading to cpYFP fluorescence changes. We assessed this biosensor for quantitative analysis of methionine-<i>R</i>-sulfoxide in various proteins, such as calmodulin, IDLO, LegP, Sacde, and actin. We further developed an immunosorbent assay using the biosensor to quantify methionine oxidation in specific proteins such as calmodulin in animal tissues.

        "abstract": "Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) is the direct energy exchange between two-component fluorescent molecules. FRET methods utilize chemically linked molecules or unlinked fluorescent molecules such as fluoresscent protein-protein interactions. FRET is therefore a powerful indicator of molecular proximity, but standardized determination of FRET efficiency is challenged when investigating natural (chemically unlinked) interactions. In this paper, we have examined the interactions of tumor necrosis factor receptor-1 (TNFR1) molecules expressed as recombinant C-terminal fusion proteins of cyan, yellow, or red fluorescent protein (-CFP, -YFP, or -RFP) to evaluate two-molecule chemically unlinked FRET by flow cytometry. We demonstrate three independent FRET pairs of TNFR1 CFP→YFP (FRET-1), YFP→RFP (FRET-2) and CFP→RFP (FRET-3), by comparing TNFR1+TNFR1 with non-interacting TNFR1+CD27 proteins, on both LSR-II and Fortessa X-20 cytometers. We describe genuine FRET activities reflecting TNFR1 homotypic interactions. The FRET events can be visualized during sample acquisition via the use of \"spiked\" FRET donor cells, together with TNFR1+TNFR1 co-transfected cells, as FRET channel mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) overlays. FRET events can also be indicated by comparing concatenated files of cells expressing either FRET positive events (TNFR1+TNFR1) or FRET negative events (TNFR1+CD27) to generate single-cell scatter plots showing loss of FRET donor brightness. Robust determination of FRET efficiency is then confirmed at the single-cell level by applying matrix calculations based on the measurements of FRET, using donor, acceptor, and FRET fluorescent intensities (I), detector channel emission coefficient (S), fluorescent protein extinction coefficients (ε) and the α factor. In this TNFR1-based system the mean CFP→YFP FRET-1 efficiency is 0.43 (LSR-II) and 0.41 (Fortessa X-20), the mean YFP→RFP FRET-2 efficiency is 0.30 (LSR-II) and 0.29 (Fortessa X-20), and the mean CFP→RFP FRET-3 efficiency is 0.56 (LSR-II) and 0.54 (Fortessa X-20). This study also embraces multi-dimensional clustering using t-SNE, Fit-SNE, UMAP, Tri-Map and PaCMAP to further demonstrate FRET.

Reporter genes for noninvasive monitoring of islet engraftment, graft mass changes, long-term survival, and graft failure support the optimization of transplantation strategies. Near-infrared fluorescent protein (iRFP) is ideal for fluorescence imaging (FI) in tissue, but also for multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) with an even higher imaging depth. Therefore, we generated reporter pigs ubiquitously expressing iRFP. CAG-iRPF720 transgenic reporter pigs were generated by somatic cell nuclear transfer from FACS-selected stable transfected donor cells. Neonatal pig islets (NPIs) were transplanted into streptozotocin-diabetic immunodeficient NOD-scid IL2Rg<sup>null</sup> (NSG) mice. FI and MSOT were performed to visualize different numbers of NPIs and to evaluate associations between signal intensity and glycemia. MSOT was also tested in a large animal model. CAG-iRFP transgenic NPIs were functionally equivalent with wild-type NPIs. Four weeks after transplantation under the kidney capsule, FI revealed a twofold higher signal for 4000-NPI compared to 1000-NPI grafts. Ten weeks after transplantation, the fluorescence intensity of the 4000-NPI graft was inversely correlated with glycemia. After intramuscular transplantation into diabetic NSG mice, MSOT revealed clear dose-dependent signals for grafts of 750, 1500, and 3000 NPIs. Dose-dependent MSOT signals were also revealed in a pig model, with stronger signals after subcutaneous (depth ∼6 mm) than after submuscular (depth ∼15 mm) placement of the NPIs. Islets from CAG-iRFP transgenic pigs are fully functional and accessible to long-term monitoring by state-of-the-art imaging modalities. The novel reporter pigs will support the development and preclinical testing of novel matrices and engraftment strategies for porcine xeno-islets.",
