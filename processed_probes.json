        "abstract": "Fluorescent biosensors have become essential tools in life sciences, enabling the visualization of the spatiotemporal dynamics of signaling molecules at the cellular level. In particular, intensity-based sensors-where changes in the concentrations of signaling molecules are detected as changes in fluorescence intensity-are widely used due to their versatility. However, such sensors are often affected by several factors, including variations in biosensor concentration, photobleaching, optical path settings, and focus drift, which hamper quantitative analysis. To overcome these challenges, we have been developing fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM)-based biosensors that utilize fluorescence lifetime-a parameter independent of probe concentration and imaging conditions-as a robust and reliable readout. Our research has focused on the quantitative visualization of physiological parameters, particularly those relevant to skeletal muscle homeostasis and ion channel activity. One example is a small-molecule fluorescent temperature sensor designed to quantify temperature changes in subcellular compartments. This sensor, based on an organic dye, enables targeting to organelle membranes and provides high spatial resolution, allowing precise detection of local heat production, such as that occurring in the mitochondria of brown adipocytes. In parallel, we have developed genetically encoded fluorescent protein-based sensors that correlate fluorescence lifetime values with the concentrations of signaling molecules such as ATP. These sensors have enabled the quantitative imaging of ATP dynamics in various cell types and multicellular systems. Furthermore, we are constructing a flexible sensor development platform, paving the way for the creation of diverse biosensors that can contribute to comprehensive studies in muscle physiology.",

        "abstract": "Calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) signaling plays a pivotal role in determining B cell fate, shaping processes such as activation, differentiation, anergy or apoptosis. Upon B cell antigen receptor activation, Ca<sup>2+</sup> is rapidly mobilized from the endoplasmic reticulum and supplemented by Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx from the extracellular space, ultimately driving activation of various signaling pathways required for appropriate B cell responses. Although mitochondria also harbor significant levels of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, how mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics are regulated in B cells in response to activation or other cues remains unknown, as do the functional consequences of altered mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels. Chemical dyes as well as a genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor with a mitochondrial targeting sequence were used to study mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics in response to various stimuli. Proximity ligation assays were performed to assess interaction between mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum. Primary mouse B cells and the Burkitt lymphoma cell line Ramos were used to study functional consequences of the loss of the Mitochondrial Calcium Uniporter. Here, we show that mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels dynamically respond to cell activation, stress and metabolic cues and that mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake is largely dependent on the Mitochondrial Calcium Uniporter. Reduced mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake has a negative impact on mitochondrial activity and also affects cell signaling. These findings demonstrate that changes in mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> contribute to shaping functional B cell responses. The spatial and temporal dynamics of Ca<sup>2+</sup> accumulation within distinct subcellular compartments, particularly the cytosol, endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria, are essential for translating extracellular and intracellular signals into specific cellular outcomes. Our study provides new insights into the regulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis in B cells.",

        "abstract": "Genetically-encoded sensors are used to control protein and metabolite production in bacterial fermentations. However, these sensors are generally optimized for exponential growth rather than stationary phase where production occurs. Here, we find that our previously engineered E. coli green light sensor CcaSR, which functions robustly in exponential phase, fails in stationary phase due to spontaneous loss of an engineered chromophore biosynthetic pathway and accumulation of CcaS and CcaR. We optimize the genetic context and expression determinants of each component, resulting in a stable system named CcaSR<sub>stat</sub> that imposes little metabolic burden, exhibits low leakiness and an 80-fold green light response, and functions exclusively in stationary phase. We combine CcaSR<sub>stat</sub>-driven enzyme expression with varied static and periodic illumination patterns to achieve high titers of the industrially-relevant phenylpropanoid p-Coumaric acid and demonstrate that these optimizations scale to benchtop bioreactor conditions. Finally, we use CcaSR<sub>stat</sub> to optimize the expression level of a co-transcribed multi-enzyme metabolic pathway encoding production of plant-derived betaxanthin family pigments. Stationary phase-optimized bacterial sensors should enhance fermentation productivity by enabling rapid interrogation of the impact of enzyme expression level and induction dynamics.",

Cholinergic signaling in the striatum contributes to such flexible behavior, yet the timing and spatial organization of acetylcholine release during contingency changes remain unclear, limiting conceptual understanding of its role in behavioral flexibility. Using a genetically encoded acetylcholine sensor and 2-photon imaging in the dorsal striatum of behaving mice, we visualized acetylcholine dynamics during acquisition and reversal learning in a virtual reality Y-maze. Rewarded outcomes evoked phasic decreases in acetylcholine, whereas unexpected non-reward following reversal triggered widespread increases that predicted lose-shift behavior. Targeted inhibition of cholinergic interneurons reduced this adaptive response. Spatial analysis revealed heterogeneous, temporally distinct signals forming functionally diverse microdomains. These findings suggest that widespread and focal acetylcholine release during unexpected outcomes promotes adaptive response shifts, offering a mechanistic framework for understanding disorders such as addiction and obsessive-compulsive rituals.",

Here, we show that acid-sensing ion channel 3 (ASIC3) dramatically delays leukemogenesis. Asic3 deletion results in a remarkably enhanced self-renewal, reduced differentiation, and 9-fold greater number of murine acute myeloid LICs. We developed an ultrasensitive, ratiometric, genetically encoded fluorescent pH sensor (pHluorin3) and demonstrated that LICs prefer localizing in the endosteal niche with a neutral pH range of 7.34-7.42, but not in the vascular niche with a lower pH range of 6.89-7.22. Unexpectedly, acid-ASIC3 signaling inhibits both murine and human LIC activities in a noncanonical manner by interacting with the N-terminal of STIM1 to reduce calcium-mediated CAMK1-CREB-MEIS1-LDHA levels, without inducing cation currents. This study reveals a pathway in suppression of leukemogenesis in the acidic BM niche and provides insight into targeting LICs or other cancer stem cells through pH-dependent ASICs.",

        "abstract": "Myasthenia gravis is a rare autoimmune disease mediated by autoantibodies directed against acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) at the neuromuscular junction. These autoantibodies cause dysfunction through AChR blockade, AChR degradation due to crosslinking and internalisation, and complement activation. A novel in vitro model of the human neuromuscular junction was established on a microfluidic platform to investigate the effect of anti-AChR autoantibodies on complement activation and neuromuscular transmission and the mechanism of action of complement inhibition in myasthenia gravis. The NeuroMuscle<sup>TM</sup> platform enabled the connection of human induced pluripotent stem-cell-derived motor neuron spheroids with three-dimensional cultures of skeletal muscle fibres, forming functional neuromuscular junctions. Functional connectivity was assessed by glutamate stimulation of motor neuron spheroids and monitoring of calcium transients in genetically encoded calcium indicator protein 6 (GCaMP6)-transduced muscle fibres. Incubation of in vitro neuromuscular junction tissues with sera from patients with anti-AChR autoantibody-positive myasthenia gravis, in contrast to healthy controls, induced a significant increase in membrane attack complex (MAC) deposition and complement split products, accompanied by a notable reduction in calcium transients. Treatment with zilucoplan, a complement component 5 (C5) inhibitor, prevented complement activation and preserved neuromuscular junction functional integrity. The model demonstrated that complement-mediated damage is a major driver of neuromuscular junction functional impairment in the myasthenia gravis patient sera tested in this study. Furthermore, the study explored the reversibility of neuromuscular junction damage, revealing that shortening the delay before initiating complement inhibitor treatment in the in vitro neuromuscular junction tissues enhances the reversibility of neuromuscular transmission. These findings offer a mechanistic rationale for the observed clinical response in patients with anti-AChR autoantibody-positive myasthenia gravis treated with C5 inhibitors. The in vitro neuromuscular junction model provides a robust platform for studying the mechanistic pathways of complement-mediated damage and evaluating therapeutic interventions for myasthenia gravis.",

Here, a genetically encoded proximity labelling probe is presented that displays engineered ascorbate peroxidase, APEX2, on the surface of EVs via fusion to EV-sorting scaffold proteins. This enables the biotinylation of producer-cell-derived surface proteins, corona proteins, and interactors in vitro. After the enrichment by streptavidin bead pulldowns, subpopulation-specific, biotinylated surfaceome and interactome are comprehensively characterized using mass spectrometry-based proteomics. Thus, a genetic tool is introduced for the high-fidelity mapping of the surfaceome and cellular interactome of EVs in vitro.

        "title": "A Reversible Mitochondrial ROS Probe for Monitoring Mitophagy Dynamics: Development and Application of MitoFlare.",
        "abstract": "Mitochondrial dysfunction and defective mitophagy are defining features of numerous neurodegenerative and metabolic disorders, yet existing tools provide limited ability to quantify mitophagy dynamics in real time within living, post-mitotic cells. Here we present MitoFlare, a mitochondria-targeted, reversible mtROS-responsive fluorogenic probe that enables continuous, non-genetic visualization of mitochondrial oxidative activation and turnover. MitoFlare incorporates dual TEMPO nitroxide quenchers into a long-wavelength rhodamine scaffold, producing >95% basal quenching and rapid, fully reversible fluorescence activation in response to mitochondrial superoxide, hydroxyl radicals, lipid-derived peroxyl species, and peroxynitrite. When combined with LysoTracker Green, MitoFlare forms a dual-probe imaging platform that resolves the entire mitophagy cascade with high spatial and temporal fidelity in intact PC12 neuronal cells. Using this platform, we established a quantitative framework comprising three mechanistically distinct metrics: (i) a proximity index that reports early mitochondrial engagement with lysosomes, (ii) Manders' M1 coefficient that captures mid-stage mitochondria-lysosome fusion and mitophagosome formation, and (iii) a quenching/swelling index that resolves terminal lysosomal degradation. Nutrient deprivation induced a complete, temporally ordered mitophagy program, including mtROS priming, Parkin-OPTN-associated fusion, and efficient acidification-dependent cargo degradation. In contrast, inhibition of v-ATPase with bafilomycin A1 arrested mitophagy at the fusion stage, resulting in persistent redox-active mitochondrial cargo that failed to undergo lysosomal digestion. Importantly, MitoFlare's reversible redox chemistry uniquely revealed accumulation of undegraded, oxidatively active mitochondrial remnants within non-acidified vesicles-pathological intermediates that are undetectable using irreversible ROS dyes or genetically encoded reporters. These findings demonstrate that mitophagy proceeds through discrete, redox-regulated and lysosome-dependent phases that can be quantitatively mapped in real time. By enabling synchronized measurement of oxidative activation, organelle trafficking, fusion, and degradation, the MitoFlare-LysoTracker system establishes a new benchmark for dynamic mitophagy analysis in physiologically relevant models. This platform provides a powerful foundation for mechanistic interrogation of mitochondrial quality control and for accelerating the discovery of therapeutic strategies aimed at restoring mitophagic fidelity in neurodegenerative, cardiovascular, and metabolic diseases.",

Bioluminescent GECIs, which generate light enzymatically, eliminate these artifacts but have been constrained by low dynamic range and suboptimal calcium affinities. Here we show that CaBLAM ('calcium bioluminescence activity monitor'), an engineered bioluminescent calcium indicator, achieves an order-of-magnitude improvement in signal contrast and a tunable affinity matched to physiological cytosolic calcium. CaBLAM enables single-cell and subcellular activity imaging at video frame rates in cultured neurons and sustained imaging over hours in awake, behaving animals.

        "abstract": "Voltage-sensing phosphatases (VSPs) provide a conserved framework for dissecting the mechanics of voltage sensing and for engineering genetically encoded voltage indicators (GEVIs). To evaluate how natural sequence diversity shapes function, we compared VSP voltage-sensing domains (VSDs) from multiple species by replacing the phosphatase domain with a fluorescent protein to enable optical detection of VSD responses. Every construct that reached the plasma membrane produced a voltage-dependent optical signal, underscoring the deep conservation of voltage sensing across VSP orthologs. Yet lineage-specific substitutions generated strikingly different phenotypes. A plankton VSP ortholog from <i>Eurytemora carolleeae</i> and the Sea Hare (<i>Aplysia californica</i>) VSP exhibited left-shifted activation ranges, producing robust fluorescence transitions during modest depolarizations of the plasma membrane. The human VSD of hVSP2 yielded weak, sluggish responses with poor recovery, but reintroduction of a conserved arginine in S1 (G95R) partially restored reversibility, implicating lipid-facing residues in conformational stability. The Chinese hamster (<i>Cricetulus griseus</i>) VSD, with atypical S4 sensing charges (RWIR), generated a slow fluorescence increase during depolarization, while reverting to the consensus arginine (RRIR) inverted the polarity to a decrease. These contrasting behaviors show that single residue changes can reshape how VSD movements influence the fluorescent reporter, highlighting the molecular precision revealed by GEVI measurements. Together, these results show that voltage-dependent signaling is deeply conserved across VSPs but shaped by lineage-specific sequence variation, establishing VSPs as powerful models for probing voltage sensing and guiding GEVI design.",

Functional assays to establish pathogenicity of human variants is a key limiting factor in the clinical interpretation of genetic findings. Methods based on radioactive [3H]-GABA uptake come with significant regulatory concerns, cost, and workflow complexity, which could be resolved by an alternate assay. To address this issue, we developed a high-content fluorescence imaging assay of GAT-1-mediated GABA uptake using a genetically encoded GABA sensor, iGABA-Snfr. We demonstrated that pathogenic variants strongly reduced uptake (mean, -89.4% [95% CI, -71.5% to -107.3%]). Some variants of uncertain significance (VUS) were associated with reduced GABA uptake (G111R, S459R, V511M; mean, -101.2% [95% CI -81.1% to -121.3%]), whereas others showed only mild reduction (R211C, R566H, F242V, R419C; mean, -33.6% [95% CI -17.2% to -50.1%]), supporting variant reclassification.

As shown recently with other types of ER voltage sensors, patch-clamp fluorometry recording with our new probes demonstrated that voltage steps applied to the plasma membrane elicit a voltage change at the ER membrane. These probes exhibited subtle differences in their responses suggesting they target different ER compartments. The steeper voltage dependence of Sec61β-hVoS (mCerulean3-Sec61β) signals suggested that this probe targets an ER compartment rich in voltage-gated ion channels. The ER voltage change is slow, but its onset is virtually synchronous with the plasma membrane voltage step. This suggests a direct electrical coupling into the ER lumen through plasma membrane-ER contacts. Analysis with the aid of an equivalent circuit provided an estimate of the resistance of these contacts. The rapid, direct transmission of voltage changes from the plasma membrane to the ER provides a mechanism for regulating ER function that could be especially important in excitable cells. The sensors introduced here provide researchers with powerful tools for imaging ER voltage and assessing its impact on cellular function.",

        "abstract": "Juvenile hormone (JH) plays a central role in insect development and reproductive maturation. However, the molecular transport mechanism remains unclear because JH is difficult to detect nondestructively and in real-time. A new genetically encoded fluorescent biosensor based on Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) is composed of a JH-binding protein (JHBP) derived from <i>Bombyx mori</i>, which is fused with two fluorescent protein pairs (mTFP1 and mVenus) and exhibits a ratiometric readout. The mTFP1-JHBP-mVenus proteins, flanked by the two fluorescent proteins at the N- and C-termini, respectively, exhibited no discernible FRET as a primary FRET JH sensor. This suggests that inducible FRET by JH binding may have been compromised. Optimizing the insertion of mTFP1 into JHBP enabled inducible FRET in the presence of JH. The resulting construct, the FRET JH Indicator Agent (FREJIA), is the first ratiometric, genetically encoded, and fluorescent biosensor for JH detection. FREJIA interacts with the binding protein and emits a resonance energy transfer signal in response to binding to JH I, II, and III and methoprene at nanomolar ranges. FREJIA enables ratiometric imaging of JH III in live mammalian cells. Our results showed that FRET can be applied to the selective and ratiometric monitoring of JH levels.",

Because SA levels and signaling are highly dynamic in space and time, a suite of SA-focused tools, including SA-specific microbial biosensors and SA-responsive transcriptional and chemical reporters, has been developed to study them. This review compares three classes of tools in terms of sensitivity, specificity, temporal resolution, invasiveness, quantifiability, and suitability across species. We describe developing genetically encoded sensors that can directly sense salicylic acid and report it, for example, via a fluorescence resonance energy transfer signal or another real-time output. We offer recommendations on method selection by research goal and plant species, as well as combined protocols (long-term autoluminescence plus local probes/biosensors) for cross-validation. Future work should prioritize substrate-free, quantitative SA reporters deployable in crops and the field; coupled with CRISPR-based editing and screening, these tools would enable reporter-guided discovery of immunity genes and rapid engineering of durable disease resistance.",

In this study, <i>Arabidopsis</i> and rice lines expressing a FLIPPi biosensor were used to monitor cytosolic Pi dynamics in root epidermal cells. Sensor functionality was confirmed by measuring FRET responses to graded Pi supplies, revealing a consistent reduction in FRET ratios with increasing Pi concentrations, reflecting elevated cytosolic Pi levels.

Furthermore, live imaging demonstrated rapid and dynamic alterations in cytosolic Pi upon treatment with defense-related hormones and elicitors of immune responses supporting a link between Pi signaling and plant immunity. Finally, the application of phosphite, an analog of Pi, altered Pi dynamics in both <i>Arabidopsis</i> and rice, suggesting an interference with Pi accumulation.

A variety of nanozymes have been revealed with the ability to catalyze substrates of oxidoreductases, mostly including peroxidase (POD), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT), and some of them display multienzyme-like properties, which make them highly attractive for biomedical applications. However, the specific manifestations of nanozyemes within cells remain challenging to predict and detect. In this study, we developed a real-time, dynamic, and highly sensitive live-cell biosensor by expressing HyPer7 probe in the cytosol and mitochondria to monitor the cytosolic and mitochondrial H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> dynamics in a leukemia cell line THP-1. The successful expression of the probes in the cytosol and mitochondria was confirmed using confocal fluorescence microscopy. When the THP-1 cells were exposed to exogenous H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, the fluorescence intensity at 525 nm upon excitation with 405 nm lasers (referred to as F405) decreased, while that upon excitation with 488 nm lasers (referred to as F488) increased.

In this study, we developed four fluorescence-based biosensors for inhibitors of protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B), a therapeutic target for cancer and diabetes, and compared their performance in the presence of heterologous terpenoid pathways, a promising source of new inhibitors. When expressed in <i>Escherichia coli</i>, all four could reliably detect an exogenously supplied PTP1B inhibitor, but only one remained functional alongside terpenoid pathways, where pathway-derived stress reduced overall fluorescence. This sensor, which links PTP1B inhibition to the assembly of a split T7 RNA polymerase, exhibited a high dynamic range with minimal toxicity, a common liability of T7-based circuits. Variants of this sensor with different sensitivities to inhibition and stress allowed us to separate the terpenoid pathways that made PTP1B inhibitors from those that did not. Our findings show how pathway-specific stresses (e.g., terpene synthase expression) can alter biosensor signals as strongly as their target analytes and provide a framework for disentangling these confounding effects in high-throughput screens.",

Mutation of H148 to cysteine promotes the neutral phenolic chromophore in the monomer that excites predominantly at ∼400 nm. Homodimerisation <i>via</i> a copper-dependent disulphide bridge switches the chromophore to the charged phenolate that excites at ∼490 nm. The result is a ∼30 fold increase in the fluorescence emission ratio. Homodimerisation kinetics are further improved by optimising the sfGFP homodimer interface, generating the variant termed GFP-diS2. Structures of the monomeric and dimeric GFP-diS2 suggest that charge switching is through peptide bond flipping and the formation of a buried organised water network around the chromophore that spans the interface region. Fusion to a leucine zipper protein dimerisation element greatly increased the GFP-diS2 association rate making it a more effective copper sensor <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> with Cu(i) instigating the signal change quicker and at lower ion concentrations than Cu(ii). Thus, GFP-diS2 provides the framework for generating a sensitive genetically encoded copper sensor and will eventually be adapted to monitor one of the most important protein-protein interactions in biology, homo-oligomerisation.",

Many reporter cell lines were created for generating phenotypic data in assigning the biological impact of large compound libraries. A major requirement of a phenotypic screen is the reporter cell lines for appropriate biomarkers with a good predictive value. Here, we have developed a stable cell expressing TagBFP2-53BP1 as a real-time sensor for DNA damage at the single-cell level that marks 53BP1 foci formation under physiological conditions, as well as toxicant-induced DNA damage. The cells were further engineered to report mitochondrial permeabilization using Smac-RFP, providing a broader application potential for this cellular model. Once the cells are further expressed with the autophagy marker EGFP-LC3, it is possible to image distinct cell fates such as autophagy, mitochondrial permeabilization, and DNA damage at the single-cell level. Using this system, we demonstrate that early cell death induced by telomerase inhibitors involves double-strand breaks and mitochondrial permeabilization. The model also enabled systematic profiling of several toxicants based on clearly noticeable cell fates. The approach of using live single-cell sensors for multiple distinct and diverse phenotypes offers great advantages over independent single-parameter-based assays, with the additional benefit of extracting heterogeneous cell responses over time, revealing more insight into the toxicity and mechanism of action for predictive applications.",

        "abstract": "Many genetically encoded voltage indicators (GEVIs) rely on fluorescent protein (FP) domains to report changes in membrane potential. Rapid and reversible disruption of steady-state fluorescence during voltage sensor activation revealed transient conformational changes near the chromophore in the FP domain, implicating chromophore flexibility as a potential mechanism of signal modulation. Substitution of a bulky phenylalanine near the chromophore with threonine (F165T) introduced a distinct secondary component in the fluorescence response, consistent with increased chromophore mobility. This effect was tunable: an external, directionally polarized offset (164<i>T</i>/166F) reoriented the internal threonine side chain, restoring steric hindrance and eliminating the secondary signal. Thus, threonine can function as a context-sensitive molecular switch shaped by β-can surface chemistry. A second internal threonine (T203) also acted as a molecular switch under modified external conditions, generating a secondary signal that is susceptible to membrane curvature during depolarization suggesting that plasma membrane geometry can modulate GEVI activity under permissive conformational states. Crystal structures of Super Ecliptic pHluorin (SE), SE A227D, and a new FP variant revealed that external residues can influence internal side chain orientation. In the new variant, pH-dependent rearrangement of the seventh β-strand dramatically repositions D147 from the interior interacting with the chromophore to the external surface, while H148 shifts from the exterior to interact with the chromophore in alkaline conditions. These insights led to the development of a new GEVI, Ulla, which inverts the polarity of the optical signal─becoming brighter upon depolarization─displays reduced pH sensitivity in the physiological range, and performs reliably under low-light, high-speed imaging conditions in vitro and in vivo using widefield and 2-photon microscopy. Together, these findings present a new approach to modulating chromophore behavior offering broad potential for FP-based biosensor development.",

While iron regulatory proteins (IRPs) function as RNA-binding proteins during iron-limiting conditions and reflect cellular iron status, we lack genetically-encodeable tools to quantify bioavailable intracellular iron status over developmental time and at single-cell resolution. In order to better understand the cellular environment that supports or restricts IRP-active conditions, particularly during complex and dynamic changes leading to differentiated states, we present a ratiometric genetically-encoded biosensor called FEOX. FEOX is a ratiometric fluorescent biosensor of the cellular iron environment based on a mammalian hemerythrin-like domain, acting as an iron-dependent ligand-based regulatory switch. Compared to increased IRP activity in response to iron-limitation, FEOX dynamics demonstrate decreased ratiometric fluorescence representing decreased cellular iron during iron-limitation. Using FEOX we are able to quantify the dynamics of the bioavailable cellular iron environment during early stem cell differentiation by ratiometric measurements at single-cell resolution. Results from FEOX and from an IRP activity sensor during stem cell pluripotency transition and early differentiation provide orthogonal support for an increased iron demand state. Using these genetically-encodeable tools will allow greater insight into cellular iron homeostasis within mammalian systems. IRPs function as RNA-binding proteins during iron-limiting conditions, regulating the stability and translation of messenger RNAs that are essential for cellular iron homeostasis. However, to better understand and study the cell and molecular regulators of the iron-limiting conditions required for IRP RNA-binding activity, new tools are needed to monitor iron-responsive alterations in the intracellular environment at single-cell resolution and over developmental time. We devised a genetically-encoded biosensor called FEOX that depends on molecular iron interactions independent of IRP function and directly gauges bioavailable cellular iron.",

In this biosensor, we elaborated a multifunctional hairpin probe that integrates target recognition, transcription amplification, and signal transduction without additional auxiliary primers.

This requires new approaches to selectively evoke presynaptic activity and measure postsynaptic responses with high spatiotemporal resolution and high sensitivity over long periods in vivo. Here we develop an all-optical approach to probe synaptic plasticity at identified cerebellar synapses in awake, behaving mice. We developed and applied JEDI-2Psub, a genetically encoded voltage indicator with increased sensitivity around resting membrane potentials, to record subthreshold and suprathreshold activity in Purkinje cell (PC) dendrites while selectively activating their granule cell (GrC) inputs using optogenetics and their climbing fiber (CF) inputs using sensory stimulation.

We show how pairing GrC activity with sensory-evoked CF inputs can trigger long-term plasticity of inhibitory responses in PCs. These results provide a blueprint for defining the rules for plasticity induction at identified synapses in awake animals during behavior.",

Originally developed for use in neurodegeneration models, GEDI can be applied to cancer cells to quantify therapy-induced death at single-cell resolution. This protocol details how to generate GEDI-expressing cancer cell lines, empirically determine stress-induced GEDI thresholds using radiation or chemotherapeutic agents, and perform time-resolved imaging and image analysis to track cell fate. This workflow is optimized for high-throughput drug and radiation screening in heterogeneous populations and is especially useful for identifying chemo- and radio-resistant subclones. Key limitations include the need for empirical GEDI threshold calibration for each treatment condition and careful standardization of imaging parameters. The protocol outputs include GEDI ratio values, single-cell time-of-death annotations, and whole-cell morphological data in parallel, which can be linked to downstream applications such as FACS-based isolation of live or dying subpopulations, transcriptomic profiling of resistant clones, or in vivo validation using xenografts or organotypic slice culture.",

        "abstract": "Dopamine (DA) is a critical neurotransmitter that regulates many physiological and behavioral processes. The central dopaminergic system plays a pivotal role in modulating general anesthesia (GA). DA release in the brain is mainly concentrated in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), prefrontal cortex, hypothalamus, and dorsal striatum. Several NAc neuron subtypes are essential for modulating states of consciousness during GA. However, whether NAc DA signal dynamics correlate with different states of consciousness under sevoflurane anesthesia remains to be elucidated. In this study, we measured the dynamic fluctuations of NAc DA levels throughout sevoflurane anesthesia to verify its role. An intensity-based genetically encoded DA indicator, dLight1.1, was employed to track DA release in the NAc. Fiber photometry combined with electroencephalogram/electromyogram recordings was employed to synchronously track NAc DA signal dynamics across different states of consciousness under sevoflurane anesthesia. Under 2.5% sevoflurane exposure, DA release in the NAc significantly increased during the initial 100 s of sevoflurane induction, which was designated as sevo on-1 (mean ± standard error of the mean [SEM]; baseline vs. sevo on-1, <i>p</i> = 0.0261), and continued to decrease in the subsequent anesthesia maintenance phases (sevo on-1 vs. sevo on-4, <i>p</i> = 0.0070). Following the cessation of sevoflurane administration (with intervals denoted as sevooff), NAc DA gradually returned to baseline levels (sevo on-1 vs. sevo off-1, <i>p</i> = 0.0096; sevo on-1 vs. sevo off-3, <i>p</i> = 0.0490; sevo on-1 vs. sevo off-4, <i>p</i> = 0.0059; sevo on-4 vs. sevo off-4, <i>p</i> = 0.0340; sevo off-1 vs. sevo off-4, <i>p</i> = 0.0451). During the induction phase, NAc DA signal dynamics markedly increased during the pre-loss of consciousness (LOC) period (pre-anesthesia baseline vs. pre-LOC, <i>p</i> = 0.0329) and significantly declined after LOC (pre-LOC vs. post-LOC, <i>p</i> = 0.0094). For the emergence period, NAc DA release exhibited a noticeable increase during the initial period after recovery of consciousness (ROC) (anesthesia baseline vs. post-ROC, <i>p</i> = 0.0103; pre-ROC vs. post-ROC, <i>p</i> = 0.0086). Furthermore, the DA signals peaked rapidly upon the initiation of the burst wave and then gradually attenuated, indicating a positive correlation with the burst wave onset during burst suppression events. Our findings revealed that NAc DA neurotransmitter signal dynamics correlate with different states of consciousness throughout sevoflurane anesthesia.",

To elucidate the dynamic role of α-MSH release in regulating appetite, specific, sensitive, and spatiotemporally resolved genetic sensors are required. The melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) scaffold was leveraged for its robust plasma membrane expression, high affinity for melanocortins and low affinity for AgRP to design a α-MSH selective sensor for in vivo use. This was achieved by integrating circularly permuted green fluorescent protein (cpGFP) into the receptor, which we named Fluorescence Amplified Receptor sensor for Melanocortin (FLARE<sub>MC</sub>). The FLARE<sub>MC</sub> sensor has high potency and selectivity in heterologous and homologous expressing cells for α-MSH and the synthetic melanocortin agonist MTII but not to the inverse agonist AgRP. The sensor exhibited impaired signaling, with reduced G protein activation, no β-arrestin coupling, and failed to internalize upon agonist stimulation. In vitro, FLARE<sub>MC</sub> displayed high photostability and reversible photoactivation. These properties suggest that the FLARE<sub>MC</sub> is suitable for long-term activity recording in the brain without desensitizing or interfering with endogenous melanocortin receptor signaling. When expressed in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the mouse hypothalamus, the primary site of anorexigenic α-MSH signaling, FLARE<sub>MC</sub> demonstrated its effectiveness in detecting changes associated with melanocortin responses in vivo. FLARE<sub>MC</sub> enables the study of melanocortin system in cultured cells and in vivo. This first of its class highly sensitive melanocortin sensor will serve as a valuable tool to advance our understanding of the complex dynamics governing melanocortin-dependent appetite regulation and related processes in the brain.",

However, due to limitations such as poor probe permeability and cytotoxicity associated with conventional antibody-based or genetically encoded labeling techniques, live-cell imaging remains a significant challenging. To address these limitations, here in this study, we developed and rigorously validated a novel aptamer-based fluorescent probe for real-time imaging of NEK9 kinase in living cells. First, through <i>in vitro</i> capture-SELEX, a DNA aptamer termed as Apt-011 which could selectively bind NEK9 was identified. Further, capitalizing on the small size, low immunogenicity, and synthetic flexibility of aptamers, we engineered a \"signal-on\" NEK9-specific aptamer-based fluorescent probe platform. This design leverages the aptamer's target--induced conformational change to physically separate the fluorophore-quencher pair, and it has been validated that this fluorescent probe platform could successfully visualize intracellular NEK9 in live-cells without obvious cytotoxicity (cell viability > 95% at working concentrations), offering new opportunities to study NEK9-associated signaling pathways. This work not only provides a robust tool for kinase research but also establishes a generalizable strategy to overcome key bottlenecks in live-cell imaging through rational aptamer engineering.",

        "abstract": "Agonist-induced interaction of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) with β-arrestins (βarrs) is a critical mechanism that regulates the spatiotemporal pattern of receptor localization and signaling. While the underlying mechanism governing GPCR-βarr interaction is primarily conserved and involves receptor activation and phosphorylation, there are several examples of receptor-specific fine-tuning of βarr-mediated functional outcomes. Considering the key contribution of conformational plasticity of βarrs in driving receptor-specific functional responses, it is important to develop novel sensors capable of reporting distinct βarr conformations in cellular context. Here, we design an intrabody version of a βarr-recognizing nanobody (nanobody32), referred to as intrabody32 (Ib32), in NanoLuc enzyme complementation assay format and measure its ability to recognize βarr1 and 2 in live cells upon activation of a broad set of GPCRs. Ib32 robustly recognizes activated βarr1 and 2 in the plasma membrane and endosomes, and effectively mirrors βarr recruitment profile upon stimulation of selected GPCRs. We also design an Ib32 sensor for polarization microscopy with a change in linear dichroism as readout and demonstrate its utility for monitoring βarr activation upon stimulation of selected GPCRs by natural and biased agonists. Taken together with a previously described sensor of βarr1 activation, Ib32 underscores the inherent flexibility encoded in βarrs and conformational diversity imparted by different GPCRs, which is further corroborated using an orthogonal limited proteolysis assay. Our study presents Ib32 as a sensor of βarr activation and highlights the structural diversity of βarrs, which likely allows their ability to interact with, and regulate, a large repertoire of GPCRs.",

However, it has remained difficult to measure intracellular H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> with high specificity and in a quantitative manner. Here, we present a detailed protocol for a chemogenetic method that enables the detection and quantitation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in living cells by converting intracellular H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> into fluorescent or luminescent signals. This is achieved by expressing the engineered heme peroxidase APEX2 in cells and subcellular locations of interest and by providing an appropriate fluorogenic or luminogenic substrate from outside. This method differs fundamentally from previously developed genetically encoded H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> probes; those are reversible and measure the balance between probe thiol oxidation and reduction. By contrast, APEX2 turns over its substrate irreversibly and therefore directly measures endogenous H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> availability. Our detailed step-by-step protocol covers the generation of APEX2-expressing cell lines, the implementation of fluorescent and luminescent measurements and examples for application. Ectopic expression of APEX2 can be achieved in 3 days, while the actual measurements typically require 1-2 h. This protocol is intended for entry-level scientists.",

        "abstract": "Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD), caused by perinatal alcohol exposure (PeAE) and prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE), is characterized by significant cognitive impairments, including reduced cognitive flexibility. Despite the critical role of cholinergic interneurons (CINs) in the dorsomedial striatum (DMS) for cognitive and behavioral flexibility, their contribution to neurobehavioral deficits in FASD remains unclear. To address this gap, this research explored the impact of PeAE and PAE on CIN populations and activity, cognitive flexibility, and compulsive drinking behaviors in adult offspring. We first assessed CIN number by staining striatal sections for choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) and observed a significant reduction in CINs within the posterior striatum of adult PeAE offspring. Functional assessments revealed that PeAE and PAE markedly decreased CIN firing activity and reduced acetylcholine (ACh) release in the DMS, as measured by electrophysiology recordings and live-tissue confocal imaging using a genetically encoded ACh sensor. Behaviorally, PeAE offspring exhibited a significant deficit in adapting to reversed action-outcome contingencies despite intact initial learning capabilities. Moreover, PeAE mice exhibited compulsive alcohol drinking behavior, characterized by elevated consumption and preference for quinine-adulterated alcohol. These findings collectively highlight the critical role of impaired cholinergic signaling in the cognitive and behavioral deficits observed following PeAE and PAE. Understanding this cholinergic dysfunction provides valuable insights necessary for developing targeted interventions aimed at mitigating cognitive and behavioral consequences associated with FASD.",

Specifically, the ventral tegmental area (VTA), the dopaminergic hub of the reward pathways located deep within the midbrain, is crucial for regulating the release of dopamine (DA) throughout the central nervous system (CNS). To better understand the nuances among chronic pain, VTA response, and therapeutics, implementing progressive approaches for mapping and visualizing the deep brain in real time during nociceptive stimulation is crucial. In this study, we utilize a fluorescence imaging platform with a genetically encoded calcium indicator (GCaMP6s) to directly visualize activity in the VTA during acute nociceptive stimulation in both healthy adult mice and adult mice with partial nerve ligation (PNL)-induced neuropathic pain. We also investigate the visualization of the analgesic properties of morphine. Deep brain imaging using our self-fabricated µ-complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) imaging device allows the tracking of the VTA's response to adverse stimuli. Our findings show that nociceptive stimulation is associated with a reduction in VTA fluorescence activity, supporting the potential of this platform for visualizing pain-related responses in the central nervous system. Additionally, treatment with morphine significantly reduces the neuronal response caused by mechanical stimuli and is observable using the CMOS imaging platform, demonstrating a novel way to potentially assess and treat neuropathic pain.",

        "abstract": "Status epilepticus (SE) is a severe condition that results in uncontrollable cerebral edema and cognitive dysfunction. Recent studies suggest that the localization of aquaporin-4 (AQP4) in astrocytic endfeet plays a crucial role in regulating blood-brain water transport and cell volume control, particularly along perivascular pathways. However, the signaling mechanisms underlying AQP4 localization remain poorly understood. In this study, we utilized the genetically encoded fluorescent calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) indicator GCaMp6f to investigate Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in astrocytic somata, processes, and endfeet during SE induction and observed enhanced Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in both the somata and perivascular endfeet of astrocytes. We employed genetic knockout of TRPM4 (Trpm4 <sup>-/-</sup> ) and glibenclamide treatment to explore the role of sulfonylurea receptor 1 transient receptor potential melastatin-4 (SUR1-TRPM4) channel in these Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses. Both approaches significantly suppressed the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in the astrocytic endfeet and reduced perivascular expression of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-related signaling pathway sensor calmodulin (CaM). Furthermore, we found that AQP4 localization was no longer confined to the domains of astrocytic endfeet following SE. Inhibition of SUR1-TRPM4 through pharmacological blockade or gene deletion restored the subcellular localization of AQP4, reduced cerebral edema, and improved cognitive outcomes post-SE. Our findings suggest that SUR1-TRPM4 plays a pivotal role in regulating astrocytic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals and mediating the aberrant expression and subcellular localization of astrocytic AQP4 along perivascular pathways. Together, these findings demonstrate a novel molecular mechanism underscoring SUR1-TRPM4 therapy in the treatment of SE characterized by dysregulated Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in astrocytic endfeet.",

        "abstract": "While genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicators are valuable for visualizing neural activity, their speed and sensitivity have had limited performance when compared to chemical dyes and electrophysiology, particularly at synaptic compartments. We addressed these limitations by engineering a suite of next-generation GCaMP8-based indicators, targeted to presynaptic boutons, active zones, and postsynaptic compartments at the Drosophila neuromuscular junction. We first validated these sensors to be superior to previous versions. Next, we developed a new Python-based analysis program, <i>CaFire,</i> which enables the automated quantification of evoked and spontaneous Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals. Using <i>CaFire,</i> we show a ratiometric presynaptic GCaMP8m sensor accurately captures physiologically-relevant presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> changes with superior sensitivity and similar kinetics compared to chemical dyes. Moreover, we test the ability of an active zone-targeted, ratiometric GCaMP8f sensor to report differences in Ca2+ between release sites. Finally, a newly engineered postsynaptic GCaMP8m, positioned near glutamate receptors, detects quantal events with temporal and signal resolution comparable to electrophysiological recordings. These next generation indicators and analytical methods demonstrate that GCaMP8 sensors, targeted to synaptic compartments, can now achieve the speed and sensitivity necessary to resolve Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics at levels previously only attainable with chemical dyes or electrophysiology.",

        "abstract": "The neurotransmitter histamine is involved in control of food intake, yet its dynamics during individual feeding episodes remain unexplored. Therefore, we used the novel genetically-encoded histamine sensor, HisLightG, combined with fiber photometry to measure histamine release in two hypothalamic regions critical for the food-suppressive effects of histamine, the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVH), and the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH). Male mice were tested under different conditions to assess whether hunger, time of day, or the caloric content of the solution they were given affected histamine fluctuations. We found that histamine levels changed rapidly in response to eating. These histamine fluctuations were influenced by experimental conditions, with slightly smaller responses when the test solution was sucralose (both regions) or during the light cycle (PVH only). Notable regional differences were identified, such that in the PVH histamine rebounded to above baseline levels, whereas in the VMH histamine remained lower than baseline for at least 10 s after licking ceased. In a separate cohort of male and female mice, enhancing histamine tone via administration of a histamine precursor (L-histidine) reduced the number of licks across multiple sucrose concentrations. Together, these findings indicate that histaminergic activity is modulated rapidly during ingestive episodes, and that understanding these release patterns will give insight into histamine's role in appetite suppression.",

        "abstract": "We developed the novel biosensor platform Luciferase Activity Modulated by Phosphorylation (LAMP) to monitor, with unprecedented sensitivity and dynamic range, reversible protein phosphorylation in cells. Based on NanoLuc luciferase complementation (NanoBiT), LAMP sensors are small (22 kD) and provide stable and bright light output that decreases upon phosphorylation and increases upon dephosphorylation. In this report, we designed LAMP biosensors to report spatial and temporal dynamics of cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) signaling. By incorporating both PKA phosphorylation and protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) dephosphorylation motifs into the small component of split NanoLuc (generating PKABiT/pBiT), we achieved a sevenfold dynamic range. LAMP sensors are modular and flexible, allowing the two components, LgBiT and pBiT, to be expressed as part of the same polypeptide (cis) or as part of separate, but interacting polypeptides (trans). With trans LAMP, we show that RIα and RIβ form heterodimers with activities indistinguishable from homodimers of the two PKA regulatory subunit isoforms. Cis PKA LAMP sensors revealed different activation and inactivation kinetics of endogenous, membrane anchored PKA/RI and PKA/RII holoenzymes. They also allowed us to measure kinetics of cAMP diffusion and PKA catalytic subunit translocation to the nucleus. Finally, we used a regeneratively phosphorylated PKA LAMP sensor to identify an autoinhibitory sequence in the PP2A regulatory subunit B56δ. By tailoring the sequence of pBiT, the LAMP platform can be extended to track the activity of other protein kinases and phosphatases and second messengers they respond to, thus providing new tools for cell signaling research and drug discovery.",

Optimization of the spectroscopic (electronic relaxation times) and cell growth (isotopic labeling) conditions allow for measurements of Aer with its partners - the histidine kinase (CheA) and the coupling protein (CheW) - in native signaling arrays. Continuous-wave ESR measurements at room temperature show a rigid Aer flavin immobilized in the cofactor pocket and Q-band electron nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) measurements identify a predominant anionic semiquinone radical state in cell. Q-band four-pulse double electron-electron resonance (4P-DEER) measurements indicate a 4.1 nm distance between the two flavins of an Aer homodimer, consistent with previous in vitro measurements, but also reveal additional separations in cell indicative of chemoreceptor arrays, not previously observed for Aer. For general application, we further develop a genetically encoded Light-Oxygen and Voltage (LOV) domain for incorporation into target proteins as an ESR probe of structural properties in cell.

        "abstract": "Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD), caused by prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE), is characterized by significant cognitive impairments, including reduced cognitive flexibility. Despite the critical role of cholinergic interneurons (CINs) in the dorsomedial striatum (DMS) for cognitive and behavioral flexibility, their contribution to neurobehavioral deficits in FASD remains unclear. To address this gap, this research explored the impact of PAE on CIN populations and activity, cognitive flexibility, and compulsive drinking behaviors in adult offspring. Using ChAT-Cre;Ai14-tdTomato mice combined with ChAT staining, we found substantial reductions in CIN number within the striatum of adult PAE offspring. Functional assessments revealed that PAE markedly decreased CIN firing activity and reduced acetylcholine (ACh) release in the DMS, as measured by electrophysiology recordings and live-tissue confocal imaging using a genetically encoded ACh sensor. Behaviorally, PAE-exposed offspring exhibited a significant deficit in adapting to reversed action-outcome contingencies despite intact initial learning capabilities. Moreover, PAE-exposed mice exhibited compulsive alcohol drinking behavior, characterized by elevated consumption and preference for quinine-adulterated alcohol. These findings collectively highlight the critical role of impaired cholinergic signaling in the cognitive and behavioral deficits observed following PAE. Understanding this cholinergic dysfunction provides valuable insights necessary for developing targeted interventions aimed at mitigating cognitive and behavioral consequences associated with FASD.",

To date, no versatile technology has been developed to directly label and visualize an active replicase in live plant cells because, in general, replicase function is not retained when it is fused to a protein for fluorescence imaging. We developed a technique to label and image a plant virus replicase during infection using the transiently expressed human influenza hemagglutinin (HA) frankenbody (FB), an antibody fragment that binds the HA epitope. The function of FB was demonstrated by visualizing the targeting of mCherry-fused FB (FB-mCherry) to an HA-tagged and GFP-fused endoplasmic reticulum (ER) marker protein in its native location. The combination of a two-component inducible system with the FB probe enabled FB-mCherry to label an HA epitope-tagged, functional replicase of Plantago asiatica mosaic virus (PlAMV) during its infection in Nicotiana benthamiana cells without affecting virus replication efficiency. The HA-tagged PlAMV replicase forms punctate structures associated with the ER and plasmodesmata and is localized in the vicinity of dsRNA, a hallmark of a viral replication complex. This application of epitope tag-binding intracellular probes for live subcellular imaging in plant cells offers insights into the localization dynamics of an active plant virus replicase during infection and the potential to co-localize host factors with the active replicase in situ.",

        "abstract": "Protein poly-ADP-ribosylation (PARylation) is a post-translational modification formed by transferring successive units of ADP-ribose to target proteins to form poly-ADP-ribose (PAR) chains. PAR plays a critical role in the DNA damage response (DDR) by acting as a signaling platform to promote the recruitment of DNA repair factors to the sites of DNA damage that bind via their PAR-binding domains (PBDs). Several classes of PBD families have been identified, which recognize distinct parts of the PAR chain. Proteins encoding PBDs play an essential role in conveying the PAR-mediated signal through their interaction with PAR chains, which mediates many cellular functions, including the DDR. The WWE domain, encoded in 12 human proteins, identifies the iso-ADP-ribose moiety of the PAR chain. PARylation is a heterogeneous structure that is highly dynamic in cells. Capturing the dynamics of PARylation is essential to understanding its role in the DDR, which can be achieved by expanding the tool kit for PAR detection and tracking mediated by the unique binding capability of various sensors. We recently described the WWE domain of RNF146 as a robust genetically encoded probe, when fused to EGFP, for the detection of PAR in live cells. Expanding on this, we used structural prediction tools to evaluate all of the WWE domains encoded in human proteins, evaluating each as molecular PAR probes in live cells. We demonstrate unique PAR dynamics when tracked by WWE-encoded PAR binding domains, in addition to an engineered macrodomain, that can be exploited for modulation of the PAR-dependent DNA damage response.",

Excessive light can impair growth or induce cell death, making it essential for plants to detect and respond to light fluctuations. While Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling has been linked to high light (HL) acclimation, the subcellular dynamics remain unclear. Here, we investigate Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses to HL exposure in Arabidopsis thaliana. Using a glass bead to simulate light-focusing by water droplets, a biphasic increase of Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration was detected in the chloroplast stroma by the genetically encoded calcium indicator YC3.6 and confirmed using a newly established stroma-localized R-GECO1 (NTRC-R-GECO1).

Chemical inhibition of photosynthetic electron transport, microscopy-based Fv/Fm experiments, and measurement of the reactive oxygen species (ROS)-redox balance with roGFP-based reporters and Singlet Oxygen Sensor Green (SOSG) chemical dye suggested that photodamage and singlet oxygen contribute to the stromal Ca<sup>2+</sup> response.

Genetically tagging fluorescent RNA reporters to an RNA of interest allows for investigating RNA spatiotemporal dynamics. We previously developed a fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM)-based RNA-tagging platform, Riboglow-FLIM. Here, a genetically encoded RNA tag binds a fluorescent probe, causing an increase in both fluorescence intensity and fluorescence lifetime. Importantly, the Riboglow platform is derived from a bacterial riboswitch RNA family and different riboswitch sequences from nature may build the basis for multiplexing capabilities. We previously observed fluorescence lifetime differences for two RNA tags <i>in vitro</i> and in live mammalian cells as a proof-of-concept demonstration. As an in-depth expansion for multiplexing capabilities, here we evaluate the performance of different RNA sequences <i>in vitro</i> for systematically expanding the RNA tag sequence space of Riboglow-FLIM. We use two methods of varying the genetic tag to evaluate multiplexing capabilities, a literature-guided and a rational design approach. The literature-guided approach includes riboswitch sequences with both indirect and direct evidence of probe binding. For this, a phylogenetic tree of riboswitch-derived tags from indirect binding results was constructed, and RNA members from different branches were characterized. We also designed RNA mutations rationally based on insights from established Riboglow RNA tags. Together, nine different RNA tags yielded a wide range of fluorescence lifetimes for the Riboglow-FLIM platform, building the foundation to tag and track several different RNAs simultaneously. These findings will serve as the basis for achieving multiplexed RNA imaging in live cells using a fluorescence lifetime sensor.",

Here, we developed DiPAK (for DPP8/9 activity sensor based on AK2), a ratiometric genetically encoded fluorescent sensor, which enables studying DPP8/9 activity in living cells. Using DiPAK, we determined the dynamic range of DPP8/9 activity in cells overexpressing or lacking DPP9. We identified distinct activity levels among melanoma cell lines and found that LPS-induced primary B-cell activation depends on DPP8/9 as the absence of DPP8/9 activity results in apoptotic but not pyroptotic cell death. Consistently, we observed increasing DPP8/9 activity during B-cell maturation.

        "abstract": "Adenosine (Ado), a nucleoside bridging intracellular metabolism with intercellular communication, plays an essential role in regulating processes such as sleep and seizure. While the functions of extracellular Ado (\"eAdo\") are well documented, our knowledge about the distribution and regulatory functions of intracellular Ado (\"iAdo\") is limited by a lack of methods for detecting iAdo in vivo. Here, we develop HypnoS, a genetically encoded fluorescent sensor for iAdo characterized by its high sensitivity, specificity, spatiotemporal resolution, and rapid response (sub-seconds). HypnoS enables real-time visualization of iAdo dynamics in live cultures, acute brain slices, flies, and freely moving mice. Using HypnoS for dual-color mesoscopic imaging in mice, we show that seizure-induced iAdo waves propagated across the cortex, following calcium signals. Additionally, two-photon imaging reveals that iAdo decays more rapidly in astrocytes than in neurons during seizures. Moreover, by recording iAdo dynamics in the basal forebrain during the sleep-wake cycle, we observe that iAdo signals are present during wakefulness and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, regulated by equilibrative nucleoside transporters (ENT1/2). Thus, HypnoS is a versatile and powerful tool for investigating the biological functions of iAdo across a range of physiological and pathological states.",

However, lifetime-readout sensors are poorly understood at a molecular level, complicating their development. Although there are many sensors that have fluorescence-intensity changes, there are currently only a few with fluorescence-lifetime changes. Here, we optimized two biosensors for thiol-disulfide redox (RoTq-Off and RoTq-On) with opposite changes in fluorescence lifetime in response to oxidation. Using biophysical approaches, we showed that the high-lifetime states of these sensors lock the chromophore more firmly in place than their low-lifetime states do. Two-photon fluorescence lifetime imaging of RoTq-On fused to a glutaredoxin (Grx1) enabled robust, straightforward monitoring of cytosolic glutathione redox state in acute mouse brain slices. The motional mechanism described here is probably common and may inform the design of other lifetime-readout sensors; the Grx1-RoTq-On fusion sensor will be useful for studying glutathione redox in physiology.",

However, progress in developing red-shifted GECIs, despite their advantages over green indicators, has been slower, resulting in fewer options for end users. In this study, we explored topological inversion and soma-targeting strategies, which are complementary to conventional mutagenesis, to re-engineer a red genetically encoded calcium indicator, FRCaMP, for enhanced in vivo performance. The resulting sensors, FRCaMPi and soma-targeted FRCaMPi (SomaFRCaMPi), exhibit up to 2-fold higher dynamic range and peak ΔF/F0 per single AP compared to widely used jRGECO1a in neurons both in culture and in vivo. Compared to jRGECO1a and FRCaMPi, SomaFRCaMPi reduces erroneous correlation of neuronal activity in the brains of mice and zebrafish by two- to 4-fold due to diminished neuropil contamination without compromising the signal-to-noise ratio. Under wide-field imaging in primary somatosensory and visual cortices in mice with high labeling density (80-90%), SomaFRCaMPi exhibits up to 40% higher SNR and decreased artifactual correlation across neurons. Altogether, SomaFRCaMPi improves the accuracy and scale of neuronal activity imaging at single-neuron resolution in densely labeled brain tissues due to a 2-3-fold enhanced automated neuronal segmentation, 50% higher fraction of responsive cells, up to 2-fold higher SNR compared to jRGECO1a. Our findings highlight the potential of SomaFRCaMPi, comparable to the most sensitive soma-targeted GCaMP, for precise spatial recording of neuronal populations using popular imaging modalities in model organisms such as zebrafish and mice.",

        "abstract": "Coenzyme Q10 (Q10) plays a critical role in cellular energy conversion within the mitochondrial respiratory chain and offers protective effects against oxidative and metabolic stress. In this study, we investigated the impact of Q10 on the spatio-temporal patterns of cellular energetics in keratinocyte-derived HaCaT cells, utilizing the genetically-encoded FRET sensor AMPfret. Engineered from the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), this sensor leverages endogenous affinities of the kinase that evolved to detect energy stress, specifically decreases in ATP/ADP and ATP/AMP ratios that pose a threat to cell survival. We successfully established HaCaT cells stably expressing AMPfret, validated their functionality by inducing energy stress with 2-deoxy-D-glucose, and demonstrated that Q10, together with high glucose conditions in culture, can enhance cellular energetics compared to low glucose controls. We then employed AMPfret to analyze the spatio-temporal response of HaCaT keratinocytes to Luperox (tert-butyl peroxide), a potent organic prooxidant, in the presence of varying intracellular levels of Q10. Preloading cells with Q10 was protective, slowing the speed and reducing the extend of the energy stress response. In contrast, preincubation with Simvastatin, an inhibitor of the mevalonate Q10 biosynthesis pathway, depleted cellular Q10 levels, accelerated the onset of energy stress, and led to early cell death as compared to controls. Under all conditions, AMPfret revealed cell-to-cell heterogeneity in energy stress at baseline and in the response to Luperox. Overall, tracking changes in energy state in time and at single-cell level allows further insights into the beneficial role of Q10 in enhancing cellular bioenergetics in skin cells, and a potential role of AMPK in mediating responses to altered Q10 levels.",

While conventional fluorescent proteins typically exhibit nanosecond-scale lifetimes, the development of proteins with longer lifetimes enables time-resolved detection and enhanced signal-to-noise ratios. Here, we designed a novel phosphorescent protein system by incorporating photosensitizing unnatural amino acids (UAAs) proximal to the metal center of a lanthanide binding protein (LanM). Through systematic optimization of the incorporation sites, we achieved considerable enhancement in lanthanide phosphorescence compared with that of the wild-type LanM protein. The subsequent directed evolution of LanM and chemical evolution of UAA yielded variants with an additional muti-fold increase in signal intensity. This iterative optimization strategy generated phosphorescent proteins with extended lifetimes of up to 500 μs and significantly increased brightness. Using this phosphorescence protein platform, a europium sensor with a signal-to-noise ratio of more than 100 for 200 nM Eu(III) and a detection limit of less than 10 nM was developed. In addition, a protease sensor was further designed by inserting a cleavage site into a loop of the phosphorescent protein, achieving remarkable signal-to-noise ratios at nanomolar concentrations. Finally, this phosphorescent protein was fused to the affibody and further used for immunofluorescence imaging. These applications demonstrated a novel platform for developing genetically encoded sensors with enhanced detection sensitivity through time-resolved measurements.",

As a proof-of-concept, here, we use random mutagenesis paired with anion walking to engineer a chloride-insensitive fluorescent protein named OFPxm into a functional indicator named ChlorOFF.

The major bottleneck that prevents the direct and precise representation of the nanometer-scaled organization of excitatory glutamatergic synapses is the size of antibodies, nanobodies, and the genetically encoded fluorescent tags. Here, we introduce small, high affinity synthetic probes for simplified, high contrast visualization of excitatory synapses without the limitations of larger biomolecules. In vitro binding quantification together with microscopy-based evaluation identified eSylites, a series of fluorescent bivalent peptides comprising a dye, linker, and sequence composition that show remarkable cellular target selectivity. Applied on primary neurons or brain slices at nanomolar concentrations, eSylites specifically report PSD-95, the key orchestrator of glutamate receptor nanodomains juxtaposed to the presynaptic glutamate release sites that mediate fast synaptic transmission. The eSylite design minimizes a spatial dye offset and thereby enables visualization of PSD-95 with improved localization precision and further time-resolved discrimination. In particular, we find that individual dendritic spines can contain separate nanodomains enriched for either PSD-95 or its closest homologues, PSD-93 or SAP102. Collectively, these data establish eSylites as a broadly applicable tool for simplified excitatory synapse visualization, as well as a high-end microscopy compatible probe for resolving the PSD organization with unprecedented resolution.",

To address this need, a vGEVI screening approach is developed that employs hyperspectral stimulated Raman scattering (hSRS) imaging synchronized with an induced transmembrane voltage (ITV) stimulation, revealing unique spectroscopic signatures of sensors expressed on membranes. Specifically, by screening various rhodopsin-based voltage sensors in live mammalian cells, a characteristic peak associated with retinal bound to the sensor is identified in one of the GEVIs, Archon, which exhibited a 70 cm<sup>-1</sup> red shift relative to the membrane-bound retinal.

Therefore, we used the novel genetically-encoded histamine sensor, HisLightG, combined with fiber photometry to measure histamine release in two hypothalamic regions critical for the food-suppressive effects of histamine, the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVH), and the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH). Male mice were tested under different conditions to assess whether hunger, time of day, or the caloric content of the solution they were given affected histamine fluctuations. We found that histamine levels changed rapidly in response to eating. These histamine fluctuations were influenced by experimental conditions, with slightly smaller responses when the test solution was sucralose (both regions) or during the light cycle (PVH only). Notable regional differences were identified, such that in the PVH histamine rebounded to baseline levels, whereas in the VMH histamine remained lower than baseline for at least 10 seconds after licking ceased. In a separate cohort of male and female mice, enhancing histamine tone via administration of a histamine precursor (L-histidine) reduced the number of licks across multiple sucrose concentrations. Together, these findings indicate that histaminergic activity is modulated rapidly during ingestive episodes, and that understanding these release patterns will give insight into histamine's role in appetite suppression.",

        "title": "Live Imaging of Synaptic Vesicle Recycling in the Neuromuscular Junction of Dissected Larval Zebrafish.",
        "abstract": "Neuronal communication is mediated by synaptic transmission, which depends primarily on the release of neurotransmitters stored in synaptic vesicles (SVs) in response to an action potential (AP). Since SVs are recycled locally at the presynaptic terminal, coordination of SV exocytosis and endocytosis is important for sustained synaptic transmission. A pH-sensitive green fluorescent protein, called pHluorin, provides a powerful tool to monitor SV exo/endocytosis by targeting it to the SV lumen. However, tracking AP-driven SV recycling with the pHluorin-based probes is still largely limited to in vitro culture preparations because the introduction of genetically encoded probes and subsequent optical imaging is technically challenging in general for in vivo animal models or tissue preparations. Zebrafish is a model system offering valuable features, including ease of genetic manipulation, optical clarity, and rapid external development. We recently generated a transgenic zebrafish that highly expresses a pHluorin-labeled probe at motor neuron terminals and developed a protocol to monitor AP-driven SV exo/endocytosis at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ), a well-established synapse model that forms in vivo. In this article, we show how to prepare larval zebrafish NMJ preparation suitable for pHluorin imaging. We also show that the preparation allows time-lapse imaging under conventional upright epifluorescence microscope, providing a cost-effective platform for analyzing NMJ function.",

Such energy stress then leads to AMPK activation and downstream events that maintain cellular energy homeostasis. AMPK activation by AMP, ADP, or pharmacological activators involves a conformational switch within the AMPK heterotrimeric complex. We have engineered an AMPK-based sensor, AMPfret, which translates the activating conformational switch into a fluorescence signal, based on increased fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between donor and acceptor fluorophores.

We then used widefield fluorescent imaging to measure V1 dynamics in response to visual stimuli with diverse temporal waveforms and contrasts, and compared these responses to signals measured using a genetically encoded calcium indicator (GECI) and a synthetic voltage-sensitive dye (VSD). When compared to GECI, GEVI captures faster response dynamics, tracks higher temporal frequencies, and responds to lower contrasts. To quantitatively characterize these three signals, we developed a simple nonlinear model that predicts the response dynamics to stimuli with arbitrary temporal waveforms and contrasts.

However, progress in developing red-shifted GECIs, despite their advantages over green indicators, has been slower, resulting in fewer options for end-users. In this study, we explored topological inversion and soma-targeting strategies, which are complementary to conventional mutagenesis, to re-engineer a red genetically encoded calcium indicator, FRCaMP, for enhanced <i>in vivo</i> performance. The resulting sensors, FRCaMPi and soma-targeted FRCaMPi (SomaFRCaMPi), exhibit up to 2-fold higher dynamic range and peak ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> per single AP compared to widely used jRGECO1a in neurons in culture and <i>in vivo</i>. Compared to jRGECO1a and FRCaMPi, SomaFRCaMPi reduces erroneous correlation of neuronal activity in the brains of mice and zebrafish by two- to four-fold due to diminished neuropil contamination without compromising the signal-to-noise ratio. Under wide-field imaging in primary somatosensory and visual cortex in mice with high labeling density (80-90%), SomaFRCaMPi exhibits up to 40% higher SNR and decreased artifactual correlation across neurons. Altogether, SomaFRCaMPi improves the accuracy and scale of neuronal activity imaging at single-neuron resolution in densely labeled brain tissues due to a 2-3-fold enhanced automated neuronal segmentation, 50% higher fraction of responsive cells, up to 2-fold higher SNR compared to jRGECO1a.

RNA imaging methods for spatiotemporal monitoring of RNA dynamics would facilitate the discovery of unknown functions of RNA, yet improving RNA imaging is challenging because of limitations in methods for directly monitoring native RNA, especially the dynamics of RNA transport and concentration fluctuation. Herein, a label-free and conformation switching-based genetically encoded sensor, termed the Dual-locked RNAtracker (Ducker), that realizes spatiotemporal monitoring of endogenous RNA dynamics in living cells is developed. In this Ducker system, a distinctive strategy is developed by employing one RNA target to initiate an allosteric event that triggers the two locked fluorogenic RNA aptamer (M18 Pepper) to restore the active structure and transmit adequate fluorescence signals. The intracellular circular Ducker (circDucker) realizes high-contrast and unbiased imaging of native mRNA abundance and monitors the fluctuations in RNA concentration. Importantly, it also enables spatiotemporal dynamic tracking of RNA translocation by directly visualizing the process of the mitochondrial <i>lncCyt b</i> undergoing bidirectional nucleocytoplasmic transport, indicating the bidirectional regulatory events in mitochondria and nucleus. Therefore, this highly accessible sensor affords a universal and robust platform for spatiotemporal monitoring of RNA abundance and translocation in complicated dynamic reaction networks in live systems, including mRNA, lncRNA, and microRNA, expanding the current toolbox of RNA research and shedding light on the unknown functions of RNA.",

This assay enables screening of membrane micropeptides and small molecules that modulate SERCA and Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase activity and may facilitate development of therapies that target cellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling. Of the micropeptides tested, phospholamban (PLB) had the greatest degree of inhibition of SERCA, as measured by a decrease in ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> content compared to control. Sarcolipin (SLN), endoregulin (ELN), and another-regulin (ALN) also decreased ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> content, though less potently than PLB. We also investigated micropeptides that have been shown to have a positive effect on ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake. Dwarf open reading frame (DWORF), a positive modulator of SERCA activity, and phospholemman (PLM), an inhibitor of the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase, both increased ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> content compared to control. A superinhibitory variant of PLM, R70C, further increased ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> load compared to wild type PLM. Overall, our findings indicate that the inhibitory potency of micropeptides is governed by their relative binding affinities to SERCA. This allows for finely tuned modulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling in different tissues based on differential expressions of micropeptide species. Understanding the contribution of each micropeptide to SERCA regulation may reveal novel strategies for therapeutic intervention in conditions where calcium dysregulation plays a role, such as heart disease, vascular disease, or neurodegenerative disorders.",

In this study, we observe elevated levels of 7-KC in the brains of the 3xTg mouse model of AD. To further understand the contribution of 7-KC on the oxidative environment, we developed a method to express a genetically encoded fluorescent hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) sensor in astrocytes, the primary source of cholesterol in the brain. With this sensor, we discovered that 7-KC increases H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> levels in astrocytes in vivo, but not when directly applied to astrocytes in vitro. Interestingly, when 7-KC was applied to a microglia cell line alone or mixed astrocyte and microglia cultures, it resulted in microglia activation and increased oxidative stress in astrocytes. Depletion of microglia from 3xTg mice resulted in reduced 7-KC in the brains of these mice. Taken together, these findings suggest that 7-KC, acting through microglia, contributes to increased astrocyte oxidative stress in AD.

Notably, activation of the ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) pathway in the striatum is known to trigger a transcriptional program shaping long-term responses to cocaine. Nuclear calcium signaling has also been shown to control multiple forms of transcription-dependent neuroadaptations, but the dynamics and roles of striatal nuclear calcium signaling in preclinical models of addiction remain unknown. A genetically encoded cell type-specific nuclear calcium probe has been developed to monitor calcium dynamics in the nuclei of striatal neurons, including in freely moving mice. A cell type-specific inhibitor of nuclear calcium signaling combined with 3-dimensional imaging of neuronal morphology, immunostaining, and behavior was used to disentangle the roles of nuclear calcium in NAc medium spiny neurons (MSNs) expressing the dopamine D<sub>1</sub> receptor (D1R) or D<sub>2</sub> receptor (D2R) on cocaine-evoked responses. The D1R-mediated potentiation of calcium influx through glutamate NMDA receptors, which shapes cocaine effects, also drives nuclear calcium transients. Fiber photometry revealed that cocaine-treated mice showed a sustained nuclear calcium increase in NAc D1R-MSNs. Disrupting nuclear calcium in D1R-MSNs, but not D2R-MSNs, blocked cocaine-evoked morphological changes of MSNs and gene expression and blunted cocaine's rewarding effects. Our study unravels the dynamics and roles of cocaine-induced nuclear calcium signaling increases in D1R-MSNs on molecular, cellular, and behavioral adaptations to cocaine and represents a significant breakthrough because it could contribute to the development of innovative strategies with therapeutic potential to alleviate addiction symptoms.",

        "abstract": "RNA modifications, such as N6-methylation of adenosine (m<sup>6</sup>A), serve as key regulators of cellular behaviors, and are highly dynamic; however, tools for dynamic monitoring of RNA modifications in live cells are lacking. Here, we develop a genetically encoded live-cell RNA methylation sensor that can dynamically monitor RNA m<sup>6</sup>A level at single-cell resolution. The sensor senses RNA m<sup>6</sup>A in cells via affinity-induced cytoplasmic retention using a nuclear location sequence-fused m<sup>6</sup>A reader. It allows for simultaneously measure RNA m<sup>6</sup>A dynamics and viral invasion at single-cell level. Based on the single-cell analytical tool, we found that SARS-CoV-2 infection enhances host-cell RNA m<sup>6</sup>A level, and high-level RNA m<sup>6</sup>A modification in host cells, in turn, facilitates viral infection. Particularly, Omicron, a variant of SARS-CoV-2, that features as high infection capacity, however, exhibits a reduced facilitation of m<sup>6</sup>A modification in host cells. In addition, the sensor can estimate viral inhibition via measuring cellular m<sup>6</sup>A level, that was explored for screening potential antiviral drugs. The methylation sensor can serve for elucidating the interplay between pathogens and host-cell epigenetics at single-cell level.",

While it is important to measure Arg levels in biological systems directly and in real-time, existing Arg sensors respond to l-ornithine or l-lysine. Here we report ArgS1, a new Arg sensor. It showed a concentration-dependent increase in the ratio Ex488/405 for Arg with an apparent affinity of ∼64 μM and with a dynamic range (Δ<i>R</i>/<i>R</i><sub>0</sub>) of 3. ArgS1 responds to Arg in both the cytoplasm and the subcellular organelles. ArgS1 monitored Arg levels in MDA-MB-231 cells, a breast cancer cell line deficient in a key enzyme for Arg synthesis (arginino-succinate synthetase1, ASS1) and amenable to Arg depletion therapy. We found that Arg levels in MDA-MB-231 cells decreased after depletion of extracellular Arg with a concomitant decline in cell viability. When ASS1 was overexpressed in the cells, Arg levels increased and cell viability was also enhanced. Thus, ArgS1 is an effective tool for real-time monitoring of Arg in human cells over a dynamic range of physiological and pathological relevance.",

However, the inherent features of protein clustering, especially for its reversible behavior and subtle microenvironment variation, present significant hurdles in probe chemistry for tracking protein clustering dynamics. Herein, we report a bilateral-tailored chemigenetic probe, in which an \"amphiphilic\" aggregate-induced emission luminogen (AIEgen) QMSO<sub>3</sub>Cl is covalently conjugated to a protein tag that is genetically fused to protein-of-interest (POI). Prior to target POI, the \"amphiphilic\" AIE-active QMSO<sub>3</sub>Cl achieves a completely dark state in both aqueous biological environment and lipophilic organelles, thereby ensuring an ultra-low intrinsic background interference. Upon reaching POI, the combination of synthetic molecule and genetically encoded protein allows for protein clustering-dependent ultra-sensitive response, with a substantial lighting-up fluorescence (67.5-fold) as protein transitions from disassembling to clustering state. Such ultra-high signal-to-noise ratio enables to monitor the dynamic and fate of inositol requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1) clustering/disassembling under both acute and chronic endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in living cells. For the first time, we have demonstrated the use of chemigenetic probe to reveal therapy-induced ER stress and screen drugs in a three-dimensional scenario: microviscosity change, clustering dynamic, and cluster morphology.

        "abstract": "Two or more protein ligands may compete against each other to interact transiently with a protein receptor. While this is a ubiquitous phenomenon in cell signaling, existing technologies cannot identify its kinetic complexity because specific subpopulations of binding events of different ligands are hidden in the averaging process in an ensemble. In addition, the limited time resolution of prevailing methods makes detecting and discriminating binding events among diverse interacting partners challenging. Here, we utilize a genetically encoded nanopore sensor to disentangle competitive protein-protein interactions (PPIs) in a one-on-one and label-free fashion. Our measurements involve binary mixtures of protein ligands of varying binding affinity against the same receptor, which was externally immobilized on the nanopore tip. We use the resistive-pulse technique to monitor the kinetics and dynamics of reversible PPIs without the nanopore confinement, with a high-time bandwidth, and at titratable ligand concentrations. In this way, we systematically evaluate how individual protein ligands take their turn to reside on the receptor's binding site. Further, our single-molecule determinations of these interactions are quantitatively compared with data generated by a two-ligand, one-receptor queuing model. The outcomes of this work provide a fundamental basis for future developments aimed at a better mechanistic understanding of competitive PPIs. Moreover, they may also form a platform in drug development pipelines targeting high-complexity PPIs mediated by protein hubs.",

As a proof-of-concept, here, we use random mutagenesis paired with anion walking to engineer a chloride-insensitive fluorescent protein named OFPxm into a functional indicator named ChlorOFF.

        "abstract": "The calcium cation is a crucial signaling molecule involved in numerous cellular pathways. Beyond its role as a messenger or modulator in intracellular cascades, calcium's function in excitable cells, including nerve impulse transmission, is remarkable. The central role of calcium in nervous activity has driven the rapid development of fluorescent techniques for monitoring this cation in living cells. Specifically, genetically encoded calcium indicators (GECIs) are the most in-demand molecular tools in their class. In this work, we address two issues of calcium imaging by designing indicators based on the successful GCaMP6 backbone and the fluorescent protein BrUSLEE. The first indicator variant (GCaMP6s-BrUS), with a reduced, calcium-insensitive fluorescence lifetime, has potential in monitoring calcium dynamics with a high temporal resolution in combination with advanced microscopy techniques, such as light beads microscopy, where the fluorescence lifetime limits acquisition speed. Conversely, the second variant (GCaMP6s-BrUS-145), with a flexible, calcium-sensitive fluorescence lifetime, is relevant for static measurements, particularly for determining absolute calcium concentration values using fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM). To identify the structural determinants of calcium sensitivity in these indicator variants, we determine their spatial structures. A comparative structural analysis allowed the optimization of the GCaMP6s-BrUS construct, resulting in an indicator variant combining calcium-sensitive behavior in the time domain and enhanced molecular brightness. Our data may serve as a starting point for further engineering efforts towards improved GECI variants with fine-tuned fluorescence lifetimes.",

We developed a novel experimental platform in which tissue is stimulated optogenetically while Vm and CaT are imaged simultaneously. The Vm indicator is an organic dye, while the CaT indicator is genetically encoded. We used cardiac spheroids containing cardiomyocytes and fibroblasts differentiated from human induced pluripotent stem cells as model tissue. The spheroids were genetically encoded with an optogenetic actuator, CheRiff, and the calcium indicator jRCaMP1b. The Vm indicator was the organic dye RH237. CheRiff was excited using blue light (450 nm), and both RH237 and jRCaMP1b were excited using a single band of green light (either 525-575 nm or 558-575 nm). Fluorescence emission was split and imaged by two cameras (CaT: 595-665 nm; Vm: >700 nm). The spheroids were successfully stimulated optogenetically and Vm and CaT were recorded simultaneously without cross-talk using both excitation light bands. The 525-575 nm band produced higher signal-to-noise ratios than the 558-575 nm band, but caused a slight increase in tissue excitability because of CheRiff activation. The optogenetic actuator and CaT indicator are genetically encoded and can be expressed in engineered tissue constructs. In contrast, the Vm indicator is an organic dye that can stain any tissue. This system is well-suited for studying coupling between engineered tissue grafts and host tissue because the two tissue types can be stimulated independently, and tissue activation can be unambiguously attributed to either graft or host.",

Disruption of subcellular calcium homeostasis and downstream stress pathways in the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria, including the unfolded protein response (UPR), have been implicated in the pathophysiology of noise-induced hearing loss. However, studies on the association between calcium homeostasis and stress pathways have been limited due to limited ability to measure calcium dynamics in mature-hearing, noise-exposed mice. We used a genetically encoded calcium indicator mouse model in which GCaMP6f is expressed specifically in hair cells or supporting cells under control of Myo15Cre or Sox2Cre, respectively. We performed live calcium imaging and UPR gene expression analysis in 8-week-old mice exposed to levels of noise that cause cochlear synaptopathy (98 db sound pressure level [SPL]) or permanent hearing loss (106 dB SPL). UPR activation occurred immediately after noise exposure, and the pattern of UPR activation was dependent on noise level, with the proapoptotic pathway upregulated only after 106 dB noise exposure. Spontaneous calcium transients in hair cells and intercellular calcium waves in supporting cells, which are present in neonatal cochleae, were quiescent in mature-hearing cochleae but reactivated upon noise exposure. Noise exposure of 106 dB was associated with more persistent and expansive intercellular Ca2+ signaling wave activity. These findings demonstrate a strong and dose-dependent association between noise exposure, UPR activation, and changes in calcium homeostasis in hair cells and supporting cells, suggesting that targeting these pathways may be effective to develop treatments for noise-induced hearing loss.",

        "abstract": "Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) adopt ensembles of rapidly fluctuating heterogeneous conformations, influencing their binding capabilities and supramolecular transitions. The primary conformational descriptors for understanding IDP ensembles-the radius of gyration (<i>R</i><sub>G</sub>), measured by small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), and the root mean square (rms) end-to-end distance (<i>R</i><sub>E</sub>), probed by fluorescent resonance energy transfer (FRET)-are often reported to produce inconsistent results regarding IDP expansion as a function of denaturant concentration in the buffer. This ongoing debate surrounding the FRET-SAXS discrepancy raises questions about the overall reliability of either method for quantitatively studying IDP properties. To address this discrepancy, we introduce a genetically encoded anomalous SAXS (ASAXS) ruler, enabling simultaneous and direct measurements of <i>R</i><sub>G</sub> and <i>R</i><sub>E</sub> without assuming a specific structural model. This ruler utilizes a genetically encoded noncanonical amino acid with two bromine atoms, providing an anomalous X-ray scattering signal for precise distance measurements. Through this approach, we experimentally demonstrate that the ratio between <i>R</i><sub>E</sub> and <i>R</i><sub>G</sub> varies under different denaturing conditions, highlighting the intrinsic properties of IDPs as the primary source of the observed SAXS-FRET discrepancy rather than shortcomings in either of the two established methods. The developed genetically encoded ASAXS ruler emerges as a versatile tool for both IDPs and folded proteins, providing a unified approach for obtaining complementary and site-specific conformational information in scattering experiments, thereby contributing to a deeper understanding of protein functions.",

To address this gap, we explored diverse rhodopsin proteins as GEVIs and engineered a novel GEVI, 2Photron, based on a rhodopsin from the green algae <i>Klebsormidium nitens</i>. 2Photron, combined with two photon ultrafast local volume excitation (ULoVE), enabled multiplexed readout of spiking and subthreshold voltage simultaneously with GCaMP calcium signals in visual cortical neurons of awake, behaving mice.

However, the signaling and biological functions of nuclear mTORC1 (nmTORC1) are not well understood, primarily due to limited tools for monitoring mTORC1 activity in the nucleus. In this study, we developed a genetically encoded nmTORC1 sensor, termed nTORSEL, based on the phosphorylation of the eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) binding protein 1 (4EBP1) by mTORC1 within the nucleus. nTORSEL, like its predecessor TORSEL, exhibits a fluorescent punctate pattern in the nucleus through multivalent protein-protein interactions between oligomerized 4EBP1 and eIF4E when nmTORC1 activity is low. We validated nTORSEL using biochemical analyses and imaging techniques across representative cell lines with varying levels of nmTORC1 activity. Notably, nTORSEL specifically detects physiological, pharmacological, and genetic inhibition of nmTORC1 in mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells but not in HEK293T cells. Therefore, nTORSEL is an effective tool for investigating nuclear mTORC1 signaling in cell lines.",

Whilst dormant in humans, their divergent roles during transmission become apparent soon after mosquito feeding with a rapid transformation into gametes - males forming eight motile sperm-like cells aiming to fertilise a single female gamete. Little is known about how the parasite fuels this abrupt change, and the potential role played by their large and elaborate cristate mitochondrion. Using a sex-specific antibody and functional mitochondrial labelling, we show that the male gametocyte mitochondrion is less active than that of female gametocytes and more sensitive to antimalarials targeting mitochondrial energy metabolism. Rather than a vestigial organelle discarded during male gametogenesis, we demonstrate that mitochondrial ATP synthesis is essential for its completion. Additionally, using a genetically encoded ratiometric ATP sensor, we show that gametocytes can maintain cytoplasmic ATP homeostasis in the absence of mitochondrial respiration, indicating the essentiality of the gametocyte mitochondrion for transmission alone. Together, this reveals how gametocytes responsively balance the conflicting demands of a dormant and active lifestyle, highlighting the mitochondria as a rich source of transmission-blocking targets for future drug development.",

Mitochondrion acts as a Ca<sup>2+</sup> sink and a central player for maintaining Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis. Accurately monitoring Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients within the mitochondrial matrix that undergo constant pH fluctuations is challenging, as signals of most currently available GECIs suffer from artifacts induced by physiological pH variations.

Results from molecular dynamics simulations and <i>ab initio</i> calculations revealed that the deprotonation of the chromophore may be responsible for the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent changes in TurCaMP signals. TurCaMP sensors showed inverse response to Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients, and their responses were not affected by pH changes within the range of pH 6-9.

Maturation of active insulin occurs within insulin secretory granules (ISG) by acidification of the lumen and enzymatic cleavage of insulin before secretion. This process is dysregulated in diabetes, and many questions remain on how the cell controls insulin maturation. We address this gap in knowledge by designing two genetically encoded fluorescence pH sensors and a fluorescence lifetime imaging and analysis pipeline to monitor the pH of individual secretory ISGs within live cells at higher resolution and precision than previously possible. We observed different subpopulations of ISGs based on their pH and subcellular localization. Signals regulating metabolism vs membrane depolarization mobilize different subpopulations of ISGs for secretion, and we confirm that maturation signals acidify ISGs. We conclude that different signaling networks uniquely impact ISG mobilization and secretion. Future applications of these tools will be useful for exploring how these processes are dysregulated in diabetes and provide new paths for developing more effective treatments.",

        "abstract": "Extensive phosphorylation at serine 22 (pSer22) on lamin A is the hallmark of cell mitosis, which contributes to the breakdown of nuclear envelope. In the interphase, pSer22 lamin A exists in low abundance and is involved in mechanotransduction, virus infection, and gene expression. Numerous evidences emerge to support lamin A regulation on cell function and fate by phosphorylation. However, live-cell imaging tools for visualizing the dynamics of pSer22 lamin A are yet to be established. Herein, we developed a novel lamin A phosphorylation sensor (LAPS) based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) with high sensitivity and specificity. We observed the dynamic lamin A phosphorylation during the cell cycle progression in single living cells: the increase of pSer22 modification when cells entered the mitosis and recovered upon the mitosis exit. Our biosensor also showed the gradual reduction of pSer22 modification during cell adhesion and in response to hypotonic environment. By applying LAPS, we captured the propagation of pSer22 modification from inside to outside of the inner nuclear membrane, which further led to the breakdown of nuclear envelope. Meanwhile, we found the synchronous phosphorylation of pSer22 lamin A and H3S10ph at mitosis entry. Inhibition of Aurora B, the responsible kinase for H3S10ph, could shorten the mitotic period without obvious effect on the pSer22 modification level of lamin A. Thus, LAPS allows the spatiotemporal visualization of the lamin A pSer22, which will be useful for elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying cell mitosis and mechanoresponsive processes.",

        "abstract": "Real-time and non-invasive monitoring of neuronal differentiation will help increase our understanding of neuronal development and help develop regenerative stem cell therapies for neurodegenerative diseases. Traditionally, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), western blotting, and immunofluorescence (IF) staining have been widely used to investigate stem cell differentiation; however, their limitations include endpoint analysis, invasive nature of monitoring, and lack of single-cell-level resolution. Several limitations hamper current approaches to studying neural stem cell (NSC) differentiation. In particular, fixation and staining procedures can introduce artificial changes in cellular morphology, hindering our ability to accurately monitor the progression of the process and fully understand its functional aspects, particularly those related to cellular connectivity and neural network formation. Herein, we report a novel approach to monitor neuronal differentiation of NSCs non-invasively in real-time using cell-based biosensors (CBBs). Our research efforts focused on utilizing intein-mediated protein engineering to design and construct a highly sensitive biosensor capable of detecting a biomarker of neuronal differentiation, hippocalcin. Hippocalcin is a critical protein involved in neurogenesis, and the CBB functions by translocating a fluorescence signal to report the presence of hippocalcin externally. To construct the hippocalcin sensor proteins, hippocalcin bioreceptors, AP2 and glutamate ionotropic receptor AMPA-type subunit 2 (GRIA2), were fused to each split-intein carrying split-nuclear localization signal (NLS) peptides, respectively, and a fluorescent protein was introduced as a reporter. Protein splicing (PS) was triggered in the presence of hippocalcin to generate functional signal peptides, which promptly translocated the fluorescence signal to the nucleus. The stem cell-based biosensor showed fluorescence signal translocation only upon neuronal differentiation. Undifferentiated stem cells or cells that had differentiated into astrocytes or oligodendrocytes did not show fluorescence signal translocation. The number of differentiated neurons was consistent with that measured by conventional IF staining. Furthermore, this approach allowed for the monitoring of neuronal differentiation at an earlier stage than that detected using conventional approaches, and the translocation of fluorescence signal was monitored before the noticeable expression of class III β-tubulin (TuJ1), an early neuronal differentiation marker. We believe that these novel CBBs offer an alternative to current techniques by capturing the dynamics of differentiation progress at the single-cell level and by providing a tool to evaluate how NSCs efficiently differentiate into specific cell types, particularly neurons.",

It acts as a metabolic hub linking major pathways including glycolysis, the Krebs cycle, fermentation, and synthesis of amino acids, fatty acids, isoprenoids, and nucleotides. Even though the central role of pyruvate is well established biochemically, there is a remarkable gap in our understanding of how pyruvate levels behave within cells, where pyruvate is distributed across different compartments. Moreover, differential changes in pyruvate pools may occur rapidly upon changes in metabolic fluxes. Recently, this problem has been addressed by the development of a genetically encoded pyruvate biosensor to provide first insights into the pyruvate dynamics in animal cells. Here, we established in vivo biosensing of pyruvate in plants. We provided advanced characterization of the biosensor properties and demonstrated the functionality of the sensor in the cytosol, the mitochondria, and the chloroplasts of Nicotiana benthamiana epidermal cells. Finally, we harnessed the tool to investigate the impact of photosynthesis on pyruvate with unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution, revealing pronounced changes in subcellular pyruvate pools. While highlighting the current limitations of the biosensor, this study provides proof-of-concept for how the dynamics and regulation of central carbon metabolites can be revealed in living plant tissues.",

        "abstract": "Optical methods for studying the brain offer powerful approaches for understanding how neural activity underlies complex behavior. These methods typically rely on genetically encoded sensors and actuators to monitor and control neural activity. For microendoscopic calcium imaging, injection of a virus followed by implantation of a lens probe is required to express a calcium sensor and enable optical access to the target brain region. This two-step process poses several challenges, chief among them being the risks associated with mistargeting and/or misalignment between virus expression zone, lens probe and target brain region. Here, an adeno-associated virus (AAV)-eluting polymer coating is engineered for gradient refractive index (GRIN) lenses enabling the expression of a genetically encoded calcium indicator (GCaMP) directly within the brain region of interest upon implantation of the lens. This approach requires only one surgical step and guarantees alignment between GCaMP expression and lens in the brain. Additionally, the slow virus release from these coatings increases the working time for surgical implantation, expanding the brain regions and species amenable to this approach. These enhanced capabilities should accelerate neuroscience research utilizing optical methods and advance the understanding of the neural circuit mechanisms underlying brain function and behavior in health and disease.",

        "abstract": "Activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein (Arc) plays a crucial role in synaptic plasticity, a process integral to learning and memory. Arc transcription is induced within a few minutes of stimulation, making it a useful marker for neuronal activity. However, the specific neuronal activity patterns that initiate Arc transcription have remained elusive due to the inability to observe mRNA transcription in live cells in real time. Using a genetically encoded RNA indicator (GERI) mouse model that expresses endogenous Arc mRNA tagged with multiple GFPs, we investigated Arc transcriptional activity in response to various electrical field stimulation patterns. The GERI mouse model was generated by crossing the Arc-PBS knock-in mouse, engineered with binding sites in the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of Arc mRNA, and the transgenic mouse expressing the cognate binding protein fused to GFP. In dissociated hippocampal neurons, we found that the pattern of stimulation significantly affects Arc transcription. Specifically, theta-burst stimulation consisting of high-frequency (100 Hz) bursts delivered at 10 Hz frequency induced the highest rate of Arc transcription. Concurrently, the amplitudes of nuclear calcium transients also reached their peak with 10 Hz burst stimulation, indicating a correlation between calcium concentration and transcription. However, our dual-color single-cell imaging revealed that there were no significant differences in calcium amplitudes between Arc-positive and Arc-negative neurons upon 10 Hz burst stimulation, suggesting the involvement of other factors in the induction of Arc transcription. Our live-cell RNA imaging provides a deeper insight into the complex regulation of transcription by activity patterns and calcium signaling pathways.",

        "abstract": "The objective of our study was to develop a genetically encoded biosensor for quantification of Nedd8, a post-translational modifier that regulates cellular signals through conjugation to other proteins. Perturbations in the balance of free (i.e., unconjugated) and conjugated Nedd8 caused by defects in Nedd8 enzymes or cellular stress are implicated in various diseases. Despite the biological and biomedical importance of Nedd8 dynamics, no method exists for direct quantification of free Nedd8, hindering the study of Nedd8 and activities of its associated enzymes. Genetically encoded biosensors are established as tools to study other dynamic systems, but limitations of current biosensor design methods make them poorly suited for free Nedd8 quantification. We have developed a modular method to design genetically encoded biosensors that employs a target binding domain and two reporter domains positioned on opposite sides of the target binding site. Target quantification is based on competition between target binding and the interaction of the reporter domains. We applied our design strategy to free Nedd8 quantification by developing a selective binder for free Nedd8 and combining it with fluorescent or split nanoluciferase reporters. Our sensors produced quantifiable and specific signals for free Nedd8 and enabled real-time monitoring of deneddylation by DEN1 with a physiological substrate. Our sensor design will be useful for high-throughput screening for deneddylation inhibitors, which have potential in treatment of cancers such as acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The modular design strategy can be extended to develop genetically encoded quantitative biosensors for other proteins of interest.",

We sought to genetically encode mammalian transfection sensor (Trensor) circuits and test their utility in HeLa cells for detecting molecules and methods for their propensity to influence transfection. We intended these Trensor circuits to be triggered if their host cell was treated with polyplexed pDNA or certain small-molecule modulators of transfection. We prioritized three promoters, implicated by others in feedback responses as cells import and process foreign material and stably integrated each into the genomes of three different cell lines, each upstream of a green fluorescent protein (GFP) open reading frame within a transgene. All three Trensor circuits showed an increase in their GFP expression when their host HeLa cells were incubated with pDNA and the degraded polyamidoamine dendrimer reagent, SuperFect. We next experimentally demonstrated the modulation of PEI-mediated HeLa cell transient transfection by four different small molecules, with Trichostatin A (TSA) showing the greatest propensity to boost transgene expression. The Trensor circuit based on the <i>TRA2B</i> promoter (Trensor-T) was triggered by incubation with TSA alone and not the other three small molecules.

In the present study, we investigated the effect of dopamine receptor activation on cAMP dynamics in astrocytes of the mouse olfactory bulb, the brain region with the largest population of dopaminergic neurons. Using the genetically encoded cAMP sensor Flamindo2 we visualized changes in the cytosolic cAMP concentration and showed that dopamine application results in a transient increase in cAMP. This cAMP increase could be mimicked by the D1-like receptor agonist A 68930 and was inhibited by the D1-like receptor antagonist SCH 23390, whereas D2-like receptor ligands had no effect on the astrocytic cAMP concentration.

The hermaphroditic nematode Caenorhabditis elegans provides several unique advantages for the study of the OET as it is transparent and has an ordered gonad that produces one mature oocyte every ~23 min at 20 °C. We have modified the genetically encoded calcium indicator jGCaMP7s to fluorescently indicate the moment of fertilization within a living organism. We have termed this reporter \"CaFE\" for Calcium during Fertilization in C. elegans. The CaFE reporter was engineered into a safe harbor locus in single copy, has no significant impact on physiology or fecundity, and produces a robust signal upon fertilization. Here, a series of protocols is presented for utilizing the CaFE reporter as an in vivo tool for dissecting the OET and embryogenesis. We include methods to synchronize worms, examine the effects of RNAi knockdown, mount worms for imaging, and to visualize calcium in oocytes and embryos. Additionally, we present the generation of additional worm strains to aid in this type of analysis. Demonstrating the utility of the CaFE reporter to visualize the timing of fertilization, we report that double ovulation occurs when ipp-5 is targeted by RNAi and that only the first oocyte undergoes immediate fertilization. Furthermore, the discovery of single-cell calcium transients during early embryogenesis is reported here, demonstrating that the CaFE reporter persists into early development. Importantly, the CaFE reporter in worms is simple enough to use for incorporation into course-based undergraduate research (CURE) laboratory classes.

Direct detection of these brief events using existing technologies remains challenging due to their transient nature.

Here, we create a genetically encoded label-free sensor to identify the interaction between a motif of the MYC transcription factor, a primary cancer driver, and WDR5, a chromatin-associated protein hub. Using an engineered nanopore equipped with this motif, WDR5 is probed through reversible captures and releases in a one-by-one and time-resolved fashion. Our single-molecule kinetic measurements indicate a weak-affinity interaction arising from a relatively slow complex association and a fast dissociation of WDR5 from the tethered motif. Further, we validate this subtle interaction by determinations in an ensemble using single nanodisc-wrapped nanopores immobilized on a biolayer interferometry sensor. This study also provides the proof-of-concept for a sensor that reveals unique recognition signatures of different protein binding sites.

Here, we developed a new GETI, gMELT, composed of donor and acceptor subunits, in which cyan and yellow fluorescent proteins, respectively, as a Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) pair were fused with temperature-sensitive domains. The donor and acceptor subunits associated and dissociated in response to temperature changes, altering the FRET efficiency. Consequently, gMELT functioned as a fluorescence ratiometric indicator. Untagged gMELT was expressed in the cytoplasm, whereas versions fused with specific localization signals were targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or mitochondria. All gMELT variations enabled more sensitive temperature measurements in cellular compartments than those in previous GETIs. The gMELTs, tagged with ER or mitochondrial targeting sequences, were used to detect thermogenesis in organelles stimulated chemically, a method previously known to induce thermogenesis. The observed temperature changes were comparable to previous reports, assuming that the fluorescence readout changes were exclusively due to temperature variations. Furthermore, we demonstrated how macromolecular crowding influences gMELT fluorescence given that this factor can subtly affect the fluorescence readout. Investigating thermogenesis with gMELT, accounting for factors such as macromolecular crowding, will enhance our understanding of intracellular thermogenesis phenomena.",

        "abstract": "During nutrient scarcity, plants can adapt their developmental strategy to maximize their chance of survival. Such plasticity in development is underpinned by hormonal regulation, which mediates the relationship between environmental cues and developmental outputs. In legumes, endosymbiosis with nitrogen-fixing bacteria (rhizobia) is a key adaptation for supplying the plant with nitrogen in the form of ammonium. Rhizobia are housed in lateral root-derived organs termed nodules that maintain an environment conducive to Nitrogenase in these bacteria. Several phytohormones are important for regulating the formation of nodules, with both positive and negative roles proposed for gibberellin (GA). In this study, we determine the cellular location and function of bioactive GA during nodule organogenesis using a genetically encoded second-generation GA biosensor, GIBBERELLIN PERCEPTION SENSOR 2 in Medicago truncatula. We find endogenous bioactive GA accumulates locally at the site of nodule primordia, increasing dramatically in the cortical cell layers, persisting through cell divisions, and maintaining accumulation in the mature nodule meristem. We show, through misexpression of GA-catabolic enzymes that suppress GA accumulation, that GA acts as a positive regulator of nodule growth and development. Furthermore, increasing or decreasing GA through perturbation of biosynthesis gene expression can increase or decrease the size of nodules, respectively. This is unique from lateral root formation, a developmental program that shares common organogenesis regulators. We link GA to a wider gene regulatory program by showing that nodule-identity genes induce and sustain GA accumulation necessary for proper nodule formation.",

        "abstract": "The ability of proteins to sense and transmit mechanical forces underlies many biological processes, but characterizing these forces in biological systems remains a challenge. Existing genetically encoded force sensors typically rely on fluorescence or bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (FRET or BRET) to visualize tension. However, these force sensing modules are relatively large, and interpreting measurements requires specialized image analysis and careful control experiments. Here, we report a compact molecular tension sensor that generates a bioluminescent signal in response to tension. This sensor (termed PILATeS) makes use of the split NanoLuc luciferase and consists of the <i>H. sapiens</i> titin I10 domain with the insertion of a 10-15 amino acid tag derived from the C-terminal β-strand of NanoLuc. Mechanical load across PILATeS mediates exposure of this tag to recruit the complementary split NanoLuc fragment, resulting in force-dependent bioluminescence. We demonstrate the ability of PILATeS to report biologically meaningful forces by visualizing forces at the interface between integrins and extracellular matrix substrates. We further use PILATeS as a genetically encoded sensor of tension experienced by the mechanosensing protein vinculin. We anticipate that PILATeS will provide an accessible means of visualizing molecular-scale forces in biological systems.",

Here, we developed a new genetically encoded fluorescent sensor, named PLpro-ERNuc, for detection of PLpro activity in living cells using a translocation-based readout. The sensor was designed as follows. A fragment of nsp3 protein was used to direct the sensor on the cytoplasmic surface of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, thus closely mimicking the natural target of PLpro. The fluorescent part included two bright fluorescent proteins-red mScarlet I and green mNeonGreen-separated by a linker with the PLpro cleavage site. A nuclear localization signal (NLS) was attached to ensure accumulation of mNeonGreen into the nucleus upon cleavage. We tested PLpro-ERNuc in a model of recombinant PLpro expressed in HeLa cells. The sensor demonstrated the expected cytoplasmic reticular network in the red and green channels in the absence of protease, and efficient translocation of the green signal into nuclei in the PLpro-expressing cells (14-fold increase in the nucleus/cytoplasm ratio). Then, we used PLpro-ERNuc in a model of Huh7.5 cells infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, where it showed robust ER-to-nucleus translocation of the green signal in the infected cells 24 h post infection. We believe that PLpro-ERNuc represents a useful tool for screening PLpro inhibitors as well as for monitoring virus spread in a culture.",

Herein, we introduce a multiplexed imaging strategy, 'sequential Fluorogenic RNA Imaging-Enabled Sensor' (seqFRIES), which enables live-cell target detection via sequential rounds of imaging-and-stripping. In seqFRIES, multiple orthogonal fluorogenic RNA aptamers are genetically encoded inside cells, and then the corresponding cell membrane permeable dye molecules are added, imaged, and rapidly removed in consecutive detection cycles. As a proof-of-concept, we have identified in this study four fluorogenic RNA aptamer/dye pairs that can be used for highly orthogonal and multiplexed imaging in living bacterial and mammalian cells. After further optimizing the cellular fluorescence activation and deactivation kinetics of these RNA/dye pairs, the whole four-color semi-quantitative seqFRIES process can be completed in ∼20 min. Meanwhile, seqFRIES-mediated simultaneous detection of critical signalling molecules and mRNA targets was also achieved within individual living cells. We expect our validation of this new seqFRIES concept here will facilitate the further development and potential broad usage of these orthogonal fluorogenic RNA/dye pairs for multiplexed and dynamic live-cell imaging and cell biology studies.",

We characterized the affinity, pharmacological profile, spectral properties, kinetics, ligand selectivity, and potential interaction with intracellular signal transducers of NOPLight in vitro. Its functionality was established in acute brain slices by exogeneous N/OFQ application and chemogenetic induction of endogenous N/OFQ release from PNOC neurons. In vivo studies with fibre photometry enabled direct recording of NOPLight binding to exogenous N/OFQ receptor ligands, as well as detection of endogenous N/OFQ release within the paranigral ventral tegmental area (pnVTA) during natural behaviors and chemogenetic activation of PNOC neurons. In summary, we show here that NOPLight can be used to detect N/OFQ opioid peptide signal dynamics in tissue and freely behaving animals.",

Using two-photon functional imaging, we mapped the spatial activation patterns representing a wide range of ecologically relevant odors across all six developmental stages. Our findings reveal a functionally ring-shaped organization of the antennal lobe composed of specific glomerular clusters. This configuration establishes an odor-specific chemotopic representation by encoding different chemical classes and ecologically distinct odors in the form of glomerular rings. The ring-shaped glomerular arrangement, which we confirm by selective targeting of OR70a-expressing sensory neurons, occurs throughout development, and the odor-coding pattern within the glomerular population is consistent across developmental stages.

Abnormalities in lysosomal function are closely linked to diseases, such as lysosomal storage disorders, neurodegeneration, intracellular infections, and cancer among others. Emerging body of research suggests the malfunction of lysosomal hydrolase trafficking pathway to be a common denominator of several disease pathologies. However, available conventional tools to assess lysosomal hydrolase trafficking are insufficient and fail to provide a comprehensive picture about the trafficking flux and location of lysosomal hydrolases. To address some of the shortcomings, we designed a genetically-encoded fluorescent reporter containing a lysosomal hydrolase tandemly tagged with pH sensitive and insensitive fluorescent proteins, which can spatiotemporally trace the trafficking of lysosomal hydrolases. As a proof of principle, we demonstrate that the reporter can detect perturbations in hydrolase trafficking, that are induced by pharmacological manipulations and pathophysiological conditions like intracellular protein aggregates.

Here we investigate responses of PV interneurons in different layers of primary somatosensory barrel cortex (BC) to different excitatory inputs. With the genetically-encoded hybrid voltage sensor, hVOS, we recorded voltage changes in many L2/3 and L4 PV interneurons simultaneously, with stimulation applied to either L2/3 or L4. A semi-automated procedure was developed to identify small regions of interest corresponding to single responsive PV interneurons. Amplitude, half-width, and rise-time were greater for PV interneurons residing in L2/3 compared to L4. Stimulation in L2/3 elicited responses in both L2/3 and L4 with longer latency compared to stimulation in L4.

Furthermore, combining high throughput with quick analysis gives unique access to find specific connections within a large postsynaptic connectome. Voltage-Seq also allows the investigation of correlations between connectivity and gene expression changes in a postsynaptic cell-type-specific manner for both excitatory and inhibitory connections.

This sensor is highly selective for OA and exhibits a robust and rapid increase in fluorescence in response to extracellular OA. Using GRAB<sub>OA1.0</sub>, we monitored OA release in the <i>Drosophila</i> mushroom body (MB), the fly's learning center, and found that OA is released in response to both odor and shock stimuli in an aversive learning model. This OA release requires acetylcholine (ACh) released from Kenyon cells, signaling via nicotinic ACh receptors. Finally, we discovered that OA amplifies aversive learning behavior by augmenting dopamine-mediated punishment signals via Octβ1R in dopaminergic neurons, leading to alterations in synaptic plasticity within the MB. Thus, our new GRAB<sub>OA1.0</sub> sensor can be used to monitor OA release in real time under physiological conditions, providing valuable insights into the cellular and circuit mechanisms that underlie OA signaling.",

        "abstract": "During development and differentiation, histone modifications dynamically change locally and globally, associated with transcriptional regulation, DNA replication and repair, and chromosome condensation. The level of histone H4 Lys20 monomethylation (H4K20me1) increases during the G2 to M phases of the cell cycle and is enriched in facultative heterochromatin, such as inactive X chromosomes in cycling cells. To track the dynamic changes of H4K20me1 in living cells, we have developed a genetically encoded modification-specific intracellular antibody (mintbody) probe that specifically binds to the modification. Here, we report the generation of knock-in mice in which the coding sequence of the mCherry-tagged version of the H4K20me1-mintbody is inserted into the Rosa26 locus. The knock-in mice, which ubiquitously expressed the H4K20me1-mintbody, developed normally and were fertile, indicating that the expression of the probe does not disturb the cell growth, development, or differentiation. Various tissues isolated from the knock-in mice exhibited nuclear fluorescence without the need for fixation. The H4K20me1-mintbody was enriched in inactive X chromosomes in developing embryos and in XY bodies during spermatogenesis. The knock-in mice will be useful for the histochemical analysis of H4K20me1 in any cell types.",

A chimeric version of this sensor fused to either the HaloTag protein or a suitable spectrally separated fluorescent protein provides an optional ratiometric readout allowing comparisons of ATP across cellular regions.

        "abstract": "Oligodendrocytes, the myelin-producing glial cells of the central nervous system (CNS), crucially contribute to myelination and circuit function. An increasing amount of evidence suggests that intracellular calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) dynamics in oligodendrocytes mediates activity-dependent and activity-independent myelination. Unraveling how myelinating oligodendrocytes orchestrate and integrate Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals, particularly in relation to axonal firing, is crucial for gaining insights into their role in the CNS development and function, both in health and disease. In this framework, we used the recombinant adeno-associated virus/Olig001 capsid variant to express the genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator jGCaMP8s, under the control of the myelin basic protein promoter. In our study, this tool exhibits excellent tropism and selectivity for myelinating and mature oligodendrocytes, and it allows monitoring Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity in myelin-forming cells, both in isolated primary cultures and organotypic spinal cord explants. By live imaging of myelin Ca<sup>2+</sup> events in oligodendrocytes within organ cultures, we observed a rapid decline in the amplitude and duration of Ca<sup>2+</sup> events across different in vitro developmental stages. Active myelin sheath remodeling and growth are modulated at the level of myelin-axon interface through Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling, and, during early myelination in organ cultures, this phase is finely tuned by the firing of axon action potentials. In the later stages of myelination, Ca<sup>2+</sup> events in mature oligodendrocytes no longer display such a modulation, underscoring the involvement of complex Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in CNS myelination.",

        "abstract": "The accurate and rapid detection of blood lead concentration is of paramount importance for assessing human lead exposure levels. Fluorescent protein-based probes, known for their high detection capabilities and low toxicity, are extensively used in analytical sciences. However, there is currently a shortage of such probes designed for ultrasensitive detection of Pb<sup>2+</sup>, and no reported probes exist for the quantitative detection of Pb<sup>2+</sup> in blood samples. This study aims to fill this critical void by developing and evaluating a novel fluorescent protein-based probe that promises accurate and rapid lead quantification in blood. A simple and small-molecule fluorescent protein-based probe was successfully constructed herein using a peptide PbrBD designed for Pb<sup>2+</sup> recognition coupled to a single fluorescent protein, sfGFP. The probe retains a three-coordinate configuration to identify Pb<sup>2+</sup> and has a high affinity for it with a K<sub>d</sub>' of 1.48 ± 0.05 × 10<sup>-17</sup> M. It effectively transfers the conformational changes of the peptide to the chromophore upon Pb<sup>2+</sup> binding, leading to fast fluorescence quenching and a sensitive response to Pb<sup>2+</sup>. The probe offers a broad dynamic response range of approximately 37-fold and a linear detection range from 0.25 nM to 3500 nM. More importantly, the probe can resist interference of metal ions in living organisms, enabling quantitative analysis of Pb<sup>2+</sup> in the picomolar to millimolar range in serum samples with a recovery percentage of 96.64%-108.74 %. This innovative probe, the first to employ a single fluorescent protein-based probe for ultrasensitive and precise analysis of Pb<sup>2+</sup> in animal and human serum, heralds a significant advancement in environmental monitoring and public health surveillance. Furthermore, as a genetically encoded fluorescent probe, this probe also holds potential for the in vivo localization and concentration monitoring of Pb<sup>2+</sup>.",

But CO2 exposure has consequences-it can impact fertility, behavior, morphogenesis, and cytoskeletal dynamics. In this respect, Drosophila is an outstanding model for studying the impact of CO2 exposure on tissues. In this study we explored the response of intracellular pH (pHi) to a one-minute CO2 pulse using a genetically encoded, ubiquitously expressed pH sensor, tpHusion, to monitor pHi within a live, intact, whole fly. We compared wild-type flies to flies lacking Imaginal disc growth factors (Idgfs), which are chitinase-like proteins that facilitate developmental processes and the innate immune response. Morphogenetic and cytoskeletal defects in Idgf-null flies are enhanced after CO2 exposure. We found that pHi drops sharply within seconds of the beginning of a CO2 pulse and recovers over several minutes. The initial profile was nearly identical in control and Idgf-null flies but diverged as the pHi returned to normal. This study demonstrates the feasibility of monitoring pH in live adult Drosophila.

        "abstract": "Octopamine (OA), analogous to norepinephrine in vertebrates, is an essential monoamine neurotransmitter in invertebrates that plays a significant role in various biological functions, including olfactory associative learning. However, the spatial and temporal dynamics of OA <i>in vivo</i> remain poorly understood due to limitations associated with the currently available methods used to detect it. To overcome these limitations, we developed a genetically encoded GPCR activation-based (GRAB) OA sensor called GRAB<sub>OA1.0</sub>. This sensor is highly selective for OA and exhibits a robust and rapid increase in fluorescence in response to extracellular OA. Using GRAB<sub>OA1.0</sub>, we monitored OA release in the <i>Drosophila</i> mushroom body (MB), the fly's learning center, and found that OA is released in response to both odor and shock stimuli in an aversive learning model. This OA release requires acetylcholine (ACh) released from Kenyon cells, signaling via nicotinic ACh receptors. Finally, we discovered that OA amplifies aversive learning behavior by augmenting dopamine-mediated punishment signals via Octβ1R in dopaminergic neurons, leading to alterations in synaptic plasticity within the MB. Thus, our new GRAB<sub>OA1.0</sub> sensor can be used to monitor OA release in real-time under physiological conditions, providing valuable insights into the cellular and circuit mechanisms that underlie OA signaling.",

        "abstract": "The serotonergic transmitter system plays fundamental roles in the nervous system in neurotransmission, synaptic plasticity, pathological processes, and therapeutic effects of antidepressants and psychedelics, as well as in the gastrointestinal and circulatory systems. We introduce a novel small molecule fluorescent agent, termed <b>SERTlight</b>, that specifically labels serotonergic neuronal cell bodies, dendrites, and axonal projections as a serotonin transporter (SERT) fluorescent substrate. SERTlight was developed by an iterative molecular design process, based on an aminoethyl-quinolone system, to integrate structural elements that impart SERT substrate activity, sufficient fluorescent brightness, and a broad absence of pharmacological activity, including at serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5HT) receptors, other G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), ion channels, and monoamine transporters. The high labeling selectivity is not achieved by high affinity binding to SERT itself but rather by a sufficient rate of SERT-mediated transport of SERTlight, resulting in accumulation of these molecules in 5HT neurons and yielding a robust and selective optical signal in the mammalian brain. SERTlight provides a stable signal, as it is not released via exocytosis nor by reverse SERT transport induced by 5HT releasers such as MDMA. SERTlight is optically, pharmacologically, and operationally orthogonal to a wide range of genetically encoded sensors, enabling multiplexed imaging. SERTlight enables labeling of distal 5HT axonal projections and simultaneous imaging of the release of endogenous 5HT using the GRAB<sub>5HT</sub> sensor, providing a new versatile molecular tool for the study of the serotonergic system.",

Thus, resolving voltage signals in non-excitable cells demands sensors with exceptionally high voltage sensitivity.

Using rEstus, it is uncovered that the membrane voltage in several non-excitable cell lines (A375, HEK293T, MCF7) undergoes spontaneous endogenous alterations on a second to millisecond timescale. Correlation analysis of these optically recorded voltage alterations provides a direct, real-time readout of electrical cell-cell coupling, showing that visually connected A375 and HEK293T cells are also largely electrically connected, while MCF7 cells are only weakly coupled. The presented work provides enhanced tools and methods for non-invasive voltage imaging in living cells and demonstrates that spontaneous endogenous membrane voltage alterations are not limited to excitable cells but also occur in a variety of non-excitable cell types.",

Conventionally, cyan and yellow fluorescent proteins have been often used as FRET pairs. Meanwhile, bathochromically shifted indicators with green and red fluorescent protein pairs have various advantages, such as low toxicity and autofluorescence in cells. However, it remains difficult to develop them with a similar level of dynamic range as cyan and yellow fluorescent protein pairs. To improve this, we used Gamillus, which has a unique trans-configuration chromophore, as a green fluorescent protein. Based on one of the best high-dynamic-range GECIs, Twitch-NR, we developed a GECI with 1.5-times higher dynamic range (253%), Twitch-GmRR, using RRvT as a red fluorescent protein. Twitch-GmRR had high brightness and photostability and was successfully applied for imaging the Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics in live cells.

Calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) transients mediated signaling is known to be essential in cytokinesis across eukaryotic cells. However, the detailed spatiotemporal dynamics of Ca<sup>2+</sup> during plant cytokinesis remain largely unexplored. In this study, we employed GCaMP5, a genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor, to investigate cytokinetic Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients during cytokinesis in Nicotiana tabacum Bright Yellow-2 (BY-2) cells. We validated the effectiveness of GCaMP5 to capture fluctuations in intracellular free Ca<sup>2+</sup> in transgenic BY-2 cells. Our results reveal that Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics during BY-2 cell cytokinesis are distinctly different from those observed in embryonic and yeast cells. It is characterized by an initial significant Ca<sup>2+</sup> spike within the phragmoplast region. This spike is followed by a decrease in Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration at the onset of cytokinesis in phragmoplast, which then remains elevated in comparison to the cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> until the completion of cell plate formation. At the end of cytokinesis, Ca<sup>2+</sup> becomes uniformly distributed in the cytosol. This pattern contrasts with the typical dual waves of Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes observed during cytokinesis in animal embryonic cells and fission yeasts. Furthermore, applications of pharmaceutical inhibitors for either Ca<sup>2+</sup> or microtubules revealed a close correlation between Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients and microtubule organization in the regulation of cytokinesis.

        "abstract": "Genetically encoded reporters for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offer a valuable technology for making molecular-scale measurements of biological processes within living organisms with high anatomical resolution and whole-organ coverage without relying on ionizing radiation. However, most MRI reporters rely on contrast agents, typically paramagnetic metals and metal complexes, which often need to be supplemented exogenously to create optimal contrast. To eliminate the need for contrast agents, we previously introduced aquaporin-1, a mammalian water channel, as a new reporter gene for the fully autonomous detection of genetically labeled cells using diffusion-weighted MRI. In this study, we aimed to expand the toolbox of diffusion-based genetic reporters by modulating aquaporin membrane trafficking and harnessing the evolutionary diversity of water channels across species. We identified a number of new water channels that functioned as diffusion-weighted reporter genes. In addition, we show that loss-of-function variants of yeast and human aquaporins can be leveraged to design first-in-class diffusion-based sensors for detecting the activity of a model protease within living cells.",

However, comprehensive multiscale analysis of lactate metabolic dynamics in vitro and in vivo has remained an unsolved problem until now owing to the lack of a high-performance tool. We recently developed a series of genetically encoded fluorescent sensors for lactate, named FiLa, which illuminate lactate metabolism in cells, subcellular organelles, animals, and human serum and urine. In this protocol, we first describe the FiLa sensor-based strategies for real-time subcellular bioenergetic flux analysis by profiling the lactate metabolic response to different nutritional and pharmacological conditions, which provides a systematic-level view of cellular metabolic function at the subcellular scale for the first time. We also report detailed procedures for imaging lactate dynamics in live mice through a cell microcapsule system or recombinant adeno-associated virus and for the rapid and simple assay of lactate in human body fluids. This comprehensive multiscale metabolic analysis strategy may also be applied to other metabolite biosensors using various analytic platforms, further expanding its usability. The protocol is suited for users with expertise in biochemistry, molecular biology and cell biology. Typically, the preparation of FiLa-expressing cells or mice takes 2 days to 4 weeks, and live-cell and in vivo imaging can be performed within 1-2 hours. For the FiLa-based assay of body fluids, the whole measuring procedure generally takes ~1 min for one sample in a manual assay or ~3 min for 96 samples in an automatic microplate assay.",

Transgenic reporter lines to investigate physiological parameters during stress treatments remain scarce. We generated and characterized transgenic homozygous barley lines (cv. Golden Promise Fast) expressing the genetically encoded biosensor Grx1-roGFP2, which indicates the redox potential of the major antioxidant glutathione in the cytosol. Our results demonstrated functionality of the sensor in living barley plants. We determined the glutathione redox potential (EGSH) of the cytosol to be in the range of -308 mV to -320 mV. EGSH was robust against a combined NaCl (150 mM) and water deficit treatment (-0.8 MPa) but responded with oxidation to infiltration with the phytotoxic secretome of the necrotrophic fungus Botrytis cinerea. The generated reporter lines are a novel resource to study biotic and abiotic stress resilience in barley, pinpointing that even severe abiotic stress leading to a growth delay does not automatically induce cytosolic EGSH oxidation, while necrotrophic pathogens can undermine this robustness.",

To simultaneously visualize extracellular and cytosolic ATP, we developed bicistronic constructs featuring GRAB<sub>ATP1.0</sub> and MaLionR biosensors alongside the calcium sensor RCaMP, enabling multiparametric imaging.

To illuminate this essential anion across such a spectrum of biological processes, researchers have relied on fluorescence imaging with genetically encoded sensors. In large part, these have been derived from the green fluorescent protein found in the jellyfish <i>Aequorea victoria</i>. However, a standalone sensor with a turn-on intensiometric response at physiological pH has yet to be reported. Here, we address this technology gap by building on our discovery of the anion-sensitive fluorescent protein mNeonGreen (mNG). The targeted engineering of two non-coordinating residues, namely K143 and R195, in the chloride binding pocket of mNG coupled with an anion walking screening and selection strategy resulted in the ChlorON sensors: ChlorON-1 (K143W/R195L), ChlorON-2 (K143R/R195I), and ChlorON-3 (K143R/R195L). <i>In vitro</i> spectroscopy revealed that all three sensors display a robust turn-on fluorescence response to chloride (20- to 45-fold) across a wide range of affinities (<i>K</i><sub>d</sub> ≈ 30-285 mM). We further showcase how this unique sensing mechanism can be exploited to directly image labile chloride transport with spatial and temporal resolution in a cell model overexpressing the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator.

        "abstract": "The voltage sensing domain (VSD) is a four-helix modular protein domain that converts electrical signals into conformational changes, leading to open pores and active enzymes. In most voltage sensing proteins, the VSDs do not interact with one another and the S1-S3 helices are considered mainly as scaffolding. The two exceptions are the voltage sensing phosphatase (VSP) and the proton channel (Hv). VSP is a voltage-regulated enzyme and Hvs are channels that only have VSDs. To investigate the S1 contribution to VSP function, we individually mutated four hydrophobic amino acids in S1 to alanine (F127, I131, I134 and L137). We also combined these mutations to generate quadruple mutation designated S1-Q. Most of these mutations shifted the voltage dependence of activity to higher voltages though interestingly, not all substrate reactions were the same. The kinetics of enzymatic activity were also altered with some mutations significantly slowing down dephosphorylation. The voltage dependence of VSD motions were consistently shifted to lower voltages and indicated a second voltage dependent motion. Co-immunoprecipitation demonstrated that none of the mutations broke the VSP dimer indicating that the S1 impact could stem from intrasubunit and/or intersubunit interactions. Lastly, when the same alanine mutations were introduced into a genetically encoded voltage indicator, they dramatically altered the optical readings, making some of the kinetics faster and shifting the voltage dependence. These results indicate that the S1 helix in VSP plays a critical role in tuning the enzymes conformational response to membrane potential transients and influencing the function of the VSD.",

To develop intensiometric sensors with the capacity for ratiometric quantification, dual-FP Matryoshka sensors were generated by using a single cassette with a large Stokes shift (LSS) reference FP nested within the reporter FP (cpEGFP). Here, we present a genetically encoded calcium sensor that employs green apple (GA) Matryoshka technology by incorporating a newly designed red LSSmApple fluorophore. LSSmApple matures faster and provides an optimized excitation spectrum overlap with cpEGFP, allowing for monochromatic coexcitation with blue light. The LSS of LSSmApple results in improved emission spectrum separation from cpEGFP, thereby minimizing fluorophore bleed-through and facilitating imaging using standard dichroic and red FP (RFP) emission filters. We developed an image analysis pipeline for yeast (<i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>) timelapse imaging that utilizes LSSmApple to segment and track cells for high-throughput quantitative analysis.

Here, we create synthetic HSL sensors for Gram-positive <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> 168 using allosteric LuxR-type regulators (RpaR, LuxR, RhlR, and CinR) and synthetic promoters. Promoters were combinatorially designed from different sequence elements (-35, -16, -10, and transcriptional start regions). We quantified the effects of these combinatorial promoters on sensor activity and determined how regulator expression affects its activation, achieving up to 293-fold activation. Using the statistical design of experiments, we identified significant effects of promoter regions and pairwise interactions on sensor activity, which helped to understand the sequence-function relationships for synthetic promoter design.

These methods typically rely on genetically encoded sensors and actuators to monitor and control neural activity. For microendoscopic calcium imaging, injection of a virus followed by implantation of a lens probe is required to express a calcium sensor and enable optical access to the target brain region. This two-step process poses several challenges, chief among them being the risks associated with mistargeting and/or misalignment between virus expression zone, lens probe and target brain region. Here, we engineer an adeno-associated virus (AAV)-eluting polymer coating for gradient refractive index (GRIN) lenses enabling expression of a genetically encoded calcium indicator (GCaMP) directly within the brain region of interest upon implantation of the lens. This approach requires only one surgical step and guarantees alignment between GCaMP expression and lens in the brain. Additionally, the slow virus release from these coatings increases the working time for surgical implantation, expanding the brain regions and species amenable to this approach.

In this study, we revealed the innervation of the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) by Hcrt neurons in mice. Using the genetically encoded G-protein-coupled receptor activation-based Hcrt sensor, we observed a significant increase in Hcrt levels in the MEC during novel object-place exploration. We identified the function of Hcrt at presynaptic glutamatergic terminals, where it recruits fast-spiking parvalbumin-positive neurons and promotes gamma oscillations. Bidirectional manipulations of Hcrt neurons' projections from the lateral hypothalamus (LH<sub>Hcrt</sub>) to MEC revealed the essential role of this pathway in regulating object-place memory encoding, but not recall, through the modulation of gamma oscillations. Our findings highlight the significance of the LH<sub>Hcrt</sub>-MEC circuitry in supporting spatial memory and reveal a unique neural basis for the hypothalamic regulation of spatial memory.",

        "abstract": "Serotonin is emerging as a promising therapeutic target in tryptophan hydroxylase 1-positive tumors, but further mechanistic studies are needed to effectively target dysregulated serotonin metabolism. One challenge is a lack of methods for studying the dynamic nature of serotonin metabolism. Here, we report the development of a genetically encoded luminescent biosensor, termed iSero-Rluc, for the real-time detection of serotonin in live cells. The engineered serotonin binding domain (iSero) and Renilla luciferase (Rluc) reporter were cloned into yeast and mammalian expression vectors to create a fusion protein that could act as a biosensor to detect endogenous serotonin levels in live cells. The iSero-Rluc biosensor was stably expressed in the BON cell line and luciferase assays, mass spectroscopy, immunofluorescence, and Western blotting were used to study serotonin metabolism under different cell culture conditions. The iSero-Rluc sensor detected exogenous serotonin in a yeast model. When stably expressed in the BON cell line, iSero-Rluc revealed that serotonin biosynthesis is increased in an anchorage-independent growth state and is induced upon serum starvation. The iSero-Rluc biosensor is a powerful tool in the study of tumor serotonin metabolism. It enabled real-time detection of alterations in serotonin synthesis in living cells under various growth conditions and has the potential to provide greater insight into serotonin metabolism in different stages of tumor progression and to identify therapeutic strategies to target cancer metastases and carcinoid crises.",

Here, we developed a genetically encoded Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based reporter that visualizes the conformational changes in Ca2+-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs/CPKs). We focused on two CDPKs with distinct Ca2+-sensitivities, highly Ca2+-sensitive Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) AtCPK21 and rather Ca2+-insensitive AtCPK23, to report conformational changes accompanying kinase activation. In tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) pollen tubes, which naturally display coordinated spatial and temporal Ca2+ fluctuations, CPK21-FRET, but not CPK23-FRET, reported oscillatory emission ratio changes mirroring cytosolic Ca2+ changes, pointing to the isoform-specific Ca2+-sensitivity and reversibility of the conformational change. In Arabidopsis guard cells, CPK21-FRET-monitored conformational dynamics suggest that CPK21 serves as a decoder of signal-specific Ca2+ signatures in response to abscisic acid and the flagellin peptide flg22. Based on these data, CDPK-FRET is a powerful approach for tackling real-time live-cell Ca2+ decoding in a multitude of plant developmental and stress responses.",

        "abstract": "Measuring ongoing cellular activity is essential to understanding the dynamic functions of biological organisms. The most popular current approach is imaging fluorescence-based genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicators (GECIs). While fluorescent probes are useful in many contexts, bioluminescence-based GECIs-probes that generate light through oxidation of a small-molecule by a luciferase or photoprotein-have several distinct advantages. Because bioluminescent (BL) GECIs do not use the bright extrinsic excitation light required for fluorescence, BL GECIs do not photobleach, do not suffer from nonspecific autofluorescent background, and do not cause phototoxicity. Further, BL GECIs can be applied in contexts where directly shining photons on an imaging target is not possible. Despite these advantages, the use of BL GECIs has to date been limited by their small changes in bioluminescence intensity, high baseline signal at resting Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations, and suboptimal Ca<sup>2+</sup> affinities. Here, we describe a new BL GECI, CaBLAM (Ca<sup>2+</sup> BioLuminescence Activity Monitor), that displays much higher dynamic range than previous BL GECIs and has a Ca<sup>2+</sup> affinity suitable for capturing physiological changes in cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration. With these improvements, CaBLAM captures single-cell and subcellular resolution activity at high frame rates in cultured neurons and <i>in vivo</i>, and allows multi-hour recordings in mice and behaving zebrafish.

Our study was aimed at generating a stable cell line co-expressing hTRPV1 receptor and GCaMP6s calcium indicator protein and, based on this, developing high-throughput screening methods for targeting hTRPV1 agonists. The CHO-hTRPV1-GCaMP6s cell line stably expressing hTRPV1 and GCaMP6s was generated by co-transfection of hTRPV1 and GCaMP6s into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. The high-throughput screening methods were developed based on detecting the concentration of intracellular calcium ions ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>) by using chemically synthesized dyes and genetically encoded calcium indicator (GECI). Meanwhile, the sensitivity and adaptability of these methods in the evaluation of capsaicinoids were also compared. A stable cell line co-expressing hTRPV1 and GCaMP6s was generated and used to establish a functional high-throughput screening assay based on the measurement of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> by fluorometric imaging plate reader (FLIPR). The GECI exhibited a higher sensitivity and applicability than that of chemically synthesized dyes in detecting the changes in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> induced by capsaicin.

Several classes of PBD families have been recognized, which identify distinct parts of the PAR chain. Proteins encoding PBDs play an essential role in conveying the PAR-mediated signal through their interaction with PAR chains, which mediates many cellular functions, including the DDR. The WWE domain identifies the iso-ADP-ribose moiety of the PAR chain. We recently described the WWE domain of RNF146 as a robust genetically encoded probe, when fused to EGFP, for detection of PAR in live cells.

To overcome these obstacles, we developed a multiplexed high-throughput engineering platform called the optogenetic microwell array screening system (Opto-MASS) that functionally tests thousands of GEFI variants in parallel in mammalian cells. Opto-MASS represents the next step for engineering optogenetic tools as it can screen large variant libraries orders of magnitude faster than current methods.

Expanding the selection of available GECIs to include new colors and distinct photophysical properties could create new opportunities for <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> fluorescence imaging of neuronal activity.

However, our understanding of how calcium signaling regulates AE is still incomplete. In particular, the interplay between intra-acrosomal calcium dynamics and the intermediate steps leading to AE is not well-defined. Here, we describe a method that provides spatial and temporal insights into acrosomal calcium dynamics and their relationship to membrane fusion and subsequent exocytosis of the acrosome vesicle. The method utilizes a novel transgenic mouse expressing an Acrosome-targeted Sensor for Exocytosis (AcroSensE). The sensor combines a genetically encoded calcium indicator (GCaMP) fused with mCherry. This fusion protein was specifically designed to enable the concurrent observation of acrosomal calcium dynamics and membrane fusion events. Real-time monitoring of acrosomal calcium dynamics and AE in live AcroSensE sperm is achieved using a combination of high frame-rate imaging and a stimulant delivery system that can target single sperm. This protocol also provides several examples of basic methods to quantify and analyze the raw data. Because the AcroSensE model is genetically encoded, its scientific significance can be augmented by using readily available genetic tools, such as crossbreeding with other mouse genetic models or gene-editing (CRISPR) based methods. With this strategy, the roles of additional signaling pathways in sperm capacitation and fertilization can be resolved. In summary, the method described here provides a convenient and effective tool to study calcium dynamics in a specific subcellular compartment-the sperm acrosome-and how those dynamics regulate the intermediate steps leading to membrane fusion and acrosome exocytosis.",

Two sensor variants, both composed of fluorescent proteins and a membrane anchor, but differing by flexible linker domains were characterized in vitro, and the procedures for the membrane reconstitution were established. Steric pressure induced by membrane-tethered synthetic and protein crowders altered the sensors' conformation, causing increase in the intramolecular Förster's resonance energy transfer. Notably, the effect of protein crowders only weakly correlated with their molecular weight, suggesting that other factors, such as shape and charge contribute to the crowding via the quinary interactions. Finally, measurements performed in inner membrane vesicles of Escherichia coli validated the crowding-dependent dynamics of the sensors in the physiologically relevant environment. The sensors offer broad opportunities to study interfacial crowding in a complex environment of native membranes, and thus add to the toolbox of methods for studying membrane dynamics and proteostasis.",

To test this, we first evaluated dLight photometry in mouse brain slices with simultaneous FSCV and found that both techniques yielded comparable results, but notable differences in responses to dopamine transporter inhibitors, including cocaine. We then used in vivo fiber photometry with dLight in mice to examine responses to cocaine in DLS. We also compared dopamine responses during Pavlovian conditioning across the striatum. We show that dopamine increases were readily detectable in DLS and describe transient dopamine kinetics, as well as slowly developing signals during conditioning. Overall, our findings indicate that dLight photometry is well suited to measuring dopamine dynamics in DLS.",

However, genetically encoded sensors with a general design remain to be developed. Here we develop genetically encoded RNA sensors with a modular design for ratiometric and multiplexed imaging of small molecules in live cells. The sensor utilizes aptazyme as a recognition module and the light-up RNA aptamer as a signal reporter. The conformation of light-up aptamers is abrogated by a blocking sequence, and aptazyme-mediated cleavage restores the correct conformation, delivering activated fluorescence for small molecule imaging. We first developed a genetically encoded ratiometric sensor using Mango aptamer as a reference and SRB2 as a reporter. It is shown that the sensor allows quantitative imaging and detection of theophylline in live cells. The generality of the design is further demonstrated for imaging other small molecules by replacing the aptazymes. Its ability for multiplexed imaging of small molecules is further explored via the integration of different small-molecule responsive aptazymes and light-up RNA aptamers.

Despite extensive studies on the regulation of nitrate uptake and downstream responses in various cells, our knowledge of the distribution of nitrogen forms in different root cell types and their cellular compartments is still limited. Previous physiological models have relied on in vitro biochemistry and metabolite level analysis, which limits the ability to differentiate between cell types and compartments. Here, to address this, we report a nuclear-localized, genetically encoded fluorescent biosensor, which we named nlsNitraMeter3.0, for the quantitative visualization of nitrate concentration and distribution at the cellular level in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>. This biosensor was specifically designed for nitrate measurements, not nitrite. Through genetic engineering to create and select sensors using yeast, <i>Xenopus</i> oocyte, and <i>Arabidopsis</i> expression systems, we developed a reversible and highly specific nitrate sensor. This method, combined with fluorescence imaging systems such as confocal microscopy, allows for the understanding and monitoring of nitrate transporter activity in plant root cells in a minimally invasive manner. Furthermore, this approach enables the functional analysis of nitrate transporters and the measurement of nitrate distribution in plants, providing a valuable tool for plant biology research. In summary, we provide a protocol for sensor development and a biosensor that can be used to monitor nitrate levels in plants. Key features This protocol builds upon the concept of FRET biosensors for in vivo visualization of spatiotemporal nitrate levels at a cellular resolution.

GEFIs are complex proteins with multiple dynamic states, rendering optimization by trial-and-error mutagenesis a challenging problem. We applied an alternative approach using machine learning to predict the outcomes of sensor mutagenesis by analyzing established libraries that link sensor sequences to functions. Using the GCaMP calcium indicator as a scaffold, we developed an ensemble of three regression models trained on experimentally derived GCaMP mutation libraries. We used the trained ensemble to perform an in silico functional screen on 1423 novel, uncharacterized GCaMP variants. As a result, we identified the novel ensemble-derived GCaMP (eGCaMP) variants, eGCaMP and eGCaMP+, that achieve both faster kinetics and larger fluorescent responses upon stimulation than previously published fast variants. Furthermore, we identified a combinatorial mutation with extraordinary dynamic range, eGCaMP2+, that outperforms the tested 6th, 7th, and 8th generation GCaMPs. These findings demonstrate the value of machine learning as a tool to facilitate the efficient pre-screening of mutants for functional characteristics. By leveraging the learning capabilities of our ensemble, we were able to accelerate the identification of promising mutations and reduce the experimental burden associated with trial-and-error mutagenesis.

Taking advantage of the calcium response that is a hallmark of sperm-egg fusion, we adapted the genetically encoded calcium indicator jGCaMP7s to visualize the moment of fertilization in Caenorhabditis elegans using fluorescence. We termed this tool the 'CaFE' reporter, for 'calcium during fertilization in C. elegans'. The CaFE reporter produced a robust signal that recapitulated the previously reported, biphasic nature of the calcium wave and had no significant deleterious effects on worm physiology or fecundity. Calcium waves were not observed at the restrictive temperature in the spe-9(hc88) strain, in which sperm can still trigger meiotic maturation but can no longer fuse with the oocyte. Demonstrating the utility of the CaFE reporter, we analyzed polyspermy induced by inhibition of egg-3 via RNAi and observed late calcium waves in the uterus. This finding provides support to the idea that calcium release is not restricted to the first sperm fusion event during polyspermy. Establishment of the CaFE reporter in the genetically tractable and optically transparent worm provides a powerful tool to dissect the oocyte-to-embryo transition inside a living animal.",

        "abstract": "Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is an abundantly expressed peptide in the nervous system. Its widespread distribution along with its receptors, both centrally and peripherally, indicates its broad functions in numerous biological processes. However, the low endogenous concentration and diffuse distribution of NPY make it challenging to study its actions and dynamics directly and comprehensively. Studies on the role of NPY have primarily been limited to exogenous application, transgene expression, or knock-out in biological systems, which are often combined with pharmacological probes to delineate the involvement of specific NPY receptors. Therefore, to better understand the function of NPY in time and space, direct visualization of the real-time dynamics of endogenous NPY is a valuable and desired tool. Using the first-generation and newly developed intensiometric green fluorescent G-protein-coupled NPY sensor (GRAB NPY1.0), we, for the first time, demonstrate and characterize the direct detection of endogenously released NPY in cultured cortical neurons. A dose-dependent fluorescent signal was observed upon exogenous NPY application in nearly all recorded neurons. Pharmacologically evoked neuronal activity induced a significant increase in fluorescent signal in 32% of neurons, reflecting the release of NPY, despite only 3% of all neurons containing NPY. The remaining pool of neurons expressing the sensor were either non-responsive or displayed a notable decline in the fluorescent signal. Such decline in fluorescent signal was not rescued in cortical cultures transduced with an NPY overexpression vector, where 88% of the neurons were NPY-positive. Overexpression of NPY did, however, result in sensor signals that were more readily distinguishable. This may suggest that biological factors, such as subtle changes in intracellular pH, could interfere with the fluorescent signal, and thereby underestimate the release of endogenous NPY when using this new sensor in its present configuration. However, the development of next-generation NPY GRAB sensor technology is expected soon, and will eventually enable much-wanted studies on endogenous NPY release dynamics in both cultured and intact biological systems.",

        "abstract": "The dynamics of phosphatidylserine in the plasma membrane is a tightly regulated feature of eukaryotic cells. Phosphatidylserine (PS) is found preferentially in the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane. Disruption of this asymmetry leads to the exposure of phosphatidylserine on the cell surface and is associated with cell death, synaptic pruning, blood clotting and other cellular processes. Due to the role of phosphatidylserine in widespread cellular functions, an efficient phosphatidylserine probe is needed to study them. Currently, a few different phosphatidylserine labelling tools are available; however, these labels have unfavourable signal-to-noise ratios and are difficult to use in tissues due to limited permeability. Their application in living tissue requires injection procedures that damage the tissue and release damage-associated molecular patterns, which in turn stimulates phosphatidylserine exposure. For this reason, we developed a novel genetically encoded phosphatidylserine probe based on the C2 domain of the lactadherin (MFG-E8) protein, suitable for labelling exposed phosphatidylserine in various research models. We tested the C2 probe specificity to phosphatidylserine on hybrid bilayer lipid membranes by observing surface plasmon resonance angle shift. Then, we analysed purified fused C2 proteins on different cell culture lines or engineered AAVs encoding C2 probes on tissue cultures after apoptosis induction. For in vivo experiments, neurotropic AAVs were intravenously injected into perinatal mice, and after 2 weeks, brain slices were collected to observe C2-SNAP expression. The biophysical analysis revealed the high specificity of the C2 probe for phosphatidylserine. The fused recombinant C2 proteins were suitable for labelling phosphatidylserine on the surface of apoptotic cells in various cell lines. We engineered AAVs and validated them in organotypic brain tissue cultures for non-invasive delivery of the genetically encoded C2 probe and showed that these probes were expressed in the brain in vivo after intravenous AAV delivery to mice. We have demonstrated that the developed genetically encoded PS biosensor can be utilised in a variety of assays as a two-component system of C2 and C2m2 fusion proteins. This system allows for precise quantification and PS visualisation at directly specified threshold levels, enabling the evaluation of PS exposure in both physiological and cell death processes.",

These sensors typically contain RNA G-quadruplex (RG4) motifs and thus may be suboptimal in living cells. Here we describe RNA-based sensors based on Pepper, a fluorogenic RNA without an RG4 motif. With Pepper, we engineered various sensors for metabolites, synthetic compounds, proteins and metal ions in vitro and in living cells. In addition, these sensors show high activation and selectivity, demonstrating their universality and robustness. In the case of sensors responding to S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), a metabolite produced by methionine adenosyltransferase (MATase), we showed that our sensors exhibited positively correlated fluorescence responding to different SAM levels. Importantly, we revealed the SAM biosynthesis pathway and monitored MATase activity and gene expression spatiotemporally in living individual human cells. Additionally, we constructed a ratiometric SAM sensor to determine the inhibition efficacy of a MATase inhibitor in living cells. Together, these sensors comprising Pepper provide a useful platform for imaging diverse cellular targets and their signaling pathway.",

Two of the resulting GEVIs, ASAP4b and ASAP4e, respond to 100-mV depolarizations with ≥180% fluorescence increases, compared with the 50% fluorescence decrease of the parental ASAP3. With standard microscopy equipment, ASAP4e enables single-trial detection of spikes in mice over the course of minutes. Unlike GEVIs previously used for one-photon voltage recordings, ASAP4b and ASAP4e also perform well under two-photon illumination. By imaging voltage and calcium simultaneously, we show that ASAP4b and ASAP4e can identify place cells and detect voltage spikes with better temporal resolution than commonly used calcium indicators.

In addition, picosecond dynamics of intermolecular energy transfer in fluorescent proteins has been observed. Here, we present the development of a genetically encoded fluorescent sensor that can detect changes in hydrophobicity by monitoring ultrafast fluorescence depolarisation. Our sensor is composed of a pair of dimeric enhanced green fluorescent proteins (dEGFPs) linked by a flexible amino-acid linker. We show dimerisation is perturbed by the addition of glycerol which interferes with the hydrophobic interaction of the two proteins. Time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy revealed a systematic attenuation of ultrafast fluorescence depolarisation when the sensor was exposed to increasing glycerol concentrations. This suggests that as hydrophobicity increases, dEGFP pairing decreases within a tandem dimer. Un-pairing of the protein fluorophores dramatically alters the rate of energy transfer between the proteins, resulting in an increase in the limiting anisotropy of the sensor.",

Our work reveals temporal dynamics of FAK activity during FA turnover. Most importantly, our study unveils polarized FAK activity at the distal tip of newly formed single FAs in the leading edge of a migrating cell.

Despite its importance, the neuromodulatory transmission in most tissues and organs remains poorly understood due to the limitations of current tools for direct measurement of neuromodulatory transmitters. In order to study the functional roles of neuromodulatory transmitters in animal behaviors and brain disorders, new fluorescent sensors based on bacterial periplasmic binding proteins (PBPs) and G-protein coupled receptors have been developed, but their results have not been compared to or multiplexed with traditional methods such as electrophysiological recordings. In this study, a multiplexed method was developed to measure acetylcholine (ACh), norepinephrine (NE), and serotonin (5-HT) in cultured rat hippocampal slices using simultaneous whole-cell patch clamp recordings and genetically encoded fluorescence sensor imaging. The strengths and weaknesses of each technique were compared, and the results showed that both techniques did not interfere with each other. In general, genetically encoded sensors GRAB<sub><i>NE</i></sub> and GRAB<sub>5<i>HT</i>1</sub>.<sub>0</sub> showed better stability compared to electrophysiological recordings in detecting NE and 5-HT, while electrophysiological recordings had faster temporal kinetics in reporting ACh.

In sum, this study demonstrates the use of combined techniques to measure neurotransmitter dynamics and highlights the potential for future multianalyte monitoring.",

Random as well as rational targeted mutations of such sensor molecules have led to a number of important breakthroughs in this field, including the calcium sensors GCaMP6f and GCaMP6f<i><sub><i>u</i></sub></i>. jGCaMP8f of the most recently developed generation is promising a step-change in <i>in vivo</i> imaging with further increased fluorescence dynamic range.

Despite substantial advances in the field of neurotoxicology, there remain significant knowledge gaps in our understanding of cellular targets and molecular mechanisms that mediate the neurotoxicological endpoints associated with exposure to both legacy contaminants and emerging contaminants of concern. Zebrafish are a powerful neurotoxicological model given their high degree sequence conservation with humans and the similarities they share with mammals in micro- and macro-level brain structures. Many zebrafish studies have effectively utilized behavioral assays to predict the neurotoxic potential of different compounds, but behavioral phenotypes are rarely able to predict the brain structures, cell types, or mechanisms affected by chemical exposures. Calcium-modulated photoactivatable ratiometric integrator (CaMPARI), a recently developed genetically-encoded calcium indicator, undergoes a permanent green to red switch in the presence of elevated intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations and 405-nm light, which allows for a \"snapshot\" of brain activity in freely-swimming larvae. To determine whether behavioral results are predictive of patterns of neuronal activity, we assessed the effects of three common neurotoxicants, ethanol, 2,2',3,5',6-pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB 95), and monoethylhexyl phthalate (MEHP), on both brain activity and behavior by combining the behavioral light/dark assay with CaMPARI imaging. We demonstrate that brain activity profiles and behavioral phenotypes are not always concordant and, therefore, behavior alone is not sufficient to understand how toxicant exposure affects neural development and network dynamics. We conclude that pairing behavioral assays with functional neuroimaging tools such as CaMPARI provides a more comprehensive understanding of the neurotoxic endpoints of compounds while still offering a relatively high throughput approach to toxicity testing.",

A new dimension in protein imaging can be offered by combining protein tags with polarity-sensitive fluorescent probes, which provide information about local nanoscale environments of target proteins within the subcellular compartments (organelles). Here, we designed three fluorescent probes based on solvatochromic nile red dye, conjugated to a HaloTag reactive targeting group through polyethylene glycol linkers of varying lengths. The probe with medium linker length, NR12-Halo, was found to label specifically a large variety of proteins localized in defined cell compartments, such as plasma membranes (outer and inner leaflets), endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, cytosol, microtubules, actin, and chromatin. Owing to its polarity-sensitive fluorophore, the probe clearly distinguished the proteins localized within apolar lipid membranes from other proteins. Moreover, it revealed dramatic changes in the environment during the life cycle of proteins from biosynthesis to their expected localization and, finally, to recycling inside lysosomes. Heterogeneity in the local polarity of some membrane proteins also suggested a formation of low-polar protein aggregates, for example, within cell-cell contacts. The approach also showed that mechanical stress (cell shrinking by osmotic shock) induced a general polarity decrease in membrane proteins, probably due to the condensation of biomolecules. Finally, the nanoenvironment of some membrane proteins was affected by a polyunsaturated fatty acid diet, which provided the bridge between organization of lipids and proteins. The developed solvatochromic HaloTag probe constitutes a promising tool for probing nanoscale environments of proteins and their interactions within subcellular structures.",

However, due to the spectral overlap of common fluorophores, multiplexed fluorescence imaging beyond two-to-three targets inside living cells remains a technical challenge. Herein, we introduce a multiplexed imaging strategy that enables live-cell target detection via sequential rounds of imaging-and-stripping process, which is named as \"sequential Fluorogenic RNA Imaging-Enabled Sensor\" (seqFRIES). In seqFRIES, multiple orthogonal fluorogenic RNA aptamers are genetically encoded inside cells, and then the corresponding cell membrane permeable dye molecules are added, imaged, and rapidly removed in consecutive detection cycles. As a proof-of-concept, we have identified in this study five <i>in vitro</i> orthogonal fluorogenic RNA aptamer/dye pairs (>10-fold higher fluorescence signals), four of which can be used for highly orthogonal and multiplexed imaging in living bacterial and mammalian cells. After further optimizing the cellular fluorescence activation and deactivation kinetics of these RNA/dye pairs, the whole four-color semi-quantitative seqFRIES process can now be completed in ~20 min. Meanwhile, seqFRIES-mediated simultaneous detection of two critical signaling molecules, guanosine tetraphosphate and cyclic diguanylate, was also achieved within individual living cells. We expect our validation of this new seqFRIES concept here will facilitate the further development and potential broad usage of these orthogonal fluorogenic RNA/dye pairs for highly multiplexed and dynamic cellular imaging and cell biology studies.",

        "abstract": "Genetically encoded voltage indicators, particularly those based on microbial rhodopsins, are gaining traction in neuroscience as fluorescent sensors for imaging voltage dynamics with high-spatiotemporal precision. Here we establish a novel genetically encoded voltage indicator candidate based on the recently discovered subfamily of the microbial rhodopsin clade, termed heliorhodopsins. We discovered that upon excitation at 530 to 560 nm, wildtype heliorhodopsin exhibits near-infrared fluorescence, which is sensitive to membrane voltage. We characterized the fluorescence brightness, photostability, voltage sensitivity, and kinetics of wildtype heliorhodopsin in HEK293T cells and further examined the impact of mutating key residues near the retinal chromophore. The S237A mutation significantly improved the fluorescence response of heliorhodopsin by 76% providing a highly promising starting point for further protein evolution.",

Here we develop an automated platform to convert protein-binding RNA aptamers into riboswitch sensors that operate within low-cost cell-free assays. We demonstrate the platform by engineering 35 protein-sensing riboswitches for human monomeric C-reactive protein, human interleukin-32γ, and phage MS2 coat protein. The riboswitch sensors regulate output expression levels by up to 16-fold with input protein concentrations within the human serum range. We identify two distinct mechanisms governing riboswitch-mediated regulation of translation rates and leverage computational analysis to refine the protein-binding aptamer regions, improving design accuracy. Overall, we expand the cell-free sensor toolbox and demonstrate how computational design is used to develop protein-sensing riboswitches with future applications as low-cost medical diagnostics.",

        "abstract": "Among the biologically relevant reactive oxygen species (ROS), hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) has special properties. H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> can diffuse across membranes, has a low reactivity, and is very stable. Deprotonated cysteine residues in proteins can be oxidized by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> into a highly reactive sulfenic acid derivative (-SOH), which can react with another cysteine to form a disulfide. Under higher oxidative stress the sulfenic acid undergo further oxidation to sulfinic acid (Cys-SO<sub>2</sub>H), which can subsequently be reduced. The sulfinic acid can be hyperoxidized to sulfonic acid (Cys-SO<sub>3</sub>H), whose reduction is irreversible. Formation of sulfenic acids can have a role in sensing oxidative stress, signal transduction, modulating localization and activity to regulate protein functions. Therefore, there is an emerging interest in trying to understand the pool of proteins that result in these sorts of modification in response to oxidative stress. This is known as the sulfenome and several approaches have been developed in animal and plant cells to analyze the sulfenome under different stress responses. These approaches can be proteomic, molecular, immunological (i.e., antibodies), or expressing genetically encoded probes that specifically react to sulfenic modifications. In this chapter, we describe an additional approach that allows visualization of sulfenic modification in vivo. This is newly developed fluorescent probe DCP-Rho1 can be implemented in any plant cell to analyze the sulfenic modification.",

        "abstract": "Studying dynamic biological processes requires approaches compatible with the lifetimes of the biochemical transactions under investigation, which can be very short. We describe a genetically encoded system that allows protein neighborhoods to be mapped using visible light. Our approach involves fusing an engineered flavoprotein to a protein of interest. Brief excitation of the fusion protein leads to the labeling of nearby proteins with cell-permeable probes. Mechanistic studies reveal different labeling pathways are operational depending on the nature of the exogenous probe that is employed. When combined with quantitative proteomics, this photoproximity labeling system generates \"snapshots\" of protein territories with high temporal and spatial resolution. The intrinsic fluorescence of the fusion domain permits correlated imaging and proteomics analyses, a capability that is exploited in several contexts, including defining the protein clients of the major vault protein. The technology should be broadly useful in the biomedical area.",

Here, we present a point mutation that increases the sensitivity of Ace2 opsin-based voltage indicators. We use the mutation to develop Voltron2, an improved chemigeneic voltage indicator that has a 65% higher sensitivity to single APs and 3-fold higher sensitivity to subthreshold potentials than Voltron. Voltron2 retained the sub-millisecond kinetics and photostability of its predecessor, although with lower baseline fluorescence. In multiple in vitro and in vivo comparisons with its predecessor across multiple species, we found Voltron2 to be more sensitive to APs and subthreshold fluctuations. Finally, we used Voltron2 to study and evaluate the possible mechanisms of interneuron synchronization in the mouse hippocampus. Overall, we have discovered a generalizable mutation that significantly increases the sensitivity of Ace2 rhodopsin-based sensors, improving their voltage reporting capability.",

        "title": "Simultaneous Measurement of Changes in Mitochondrial and Endoplasmic Reticulum Free Calcium in Pancreatic Beta Cells.",
        "abstract": "The free calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) levels in pancreatic beta cell organelles have been the subject of many recent investigations. Under pathophysiological conditions, disturbances in these pools have been linked to altered intracellular communication and cellular dysfunction. To facilitate studies of subcellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in beta cells and, particularly, signaling between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria, we designed a novel dual Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor which we termed DS-1. DS-1 encodes two stoichiometrically fluorescent proteins within a single plasmid, G-CEPIA-er, targeted to the ER and R-CEPIA3-mt, targeted to mitochondria. Our goal was to simultaneously measure the ER and mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> in cells in real time. The <i>K<sub>ds</sub></i> of G-CEPIA-er and R-CEPIA3-mt for Ca<sup>2+</sup> are 672 and 3.7 μM, respectively. Confocal imaging of insulin-secreting INS-1 832/13 expressing DS-1 confirmed that the green and red fluorophores correctly colocalized with organelle-specific fluorescent markers as predicted. Further, we tested whether DS-1 exhibited the functional properties expected by challenging an INS-1 cell to glucose concentrations or drugs having well-documented effects on the ER and mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling. The data obtained were consistent with those seen using other single organelle targeted probes. These results taken together suggest that DS-1 is a promising new approach for investigating Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling within multiple organelles of the cell.",

        "abstract": "Phosphatases of regenerating liver (PRL-1, PRL-2, PRL-3; also known as PTP4A1, PTP4A2, PTP4A3, respectively) control intracellular magnesium levels by interacting with the CNNM magnesium transport regulators. Still, the exact mechanism governing magnesium transport by this protein complex is not well understood. Herein, we have developed a genetically encoded intracellular magnesium-specific reporter and demonstrate that the CNNM family inhibits the function of the TRPM7 magnesium channel. We show that the small GTPase ARL15 increases CNNM3/TRPM7 protein complex formation to reduce TRPM7 activity. Conversely, PRL-2 overexpression counteracts ARL15 binding to CNNM3 and enhances the function of TRPM7 by preventing the interaction between CNNM3 and TRPM7. Moreover, while TRPM7-induced cell signaling is promoted by PRL-1/2, it is reduced when CNNM3 is overexpressed. Lowering cellular magnesium levels reduces the interaction of CNNM3 with TRPM7 in a PRL-dependent manner, whereby knockdown of PRL-1/2 restores the protein complex formation. Cotargeting of TRPM7 and PRL-1/2 alters mitochondrial function and sensitizes cells to metabolic stress induced by magnesium depletion. These findings reveal the dynamic regulation of TRPM7 function in response to PRL-1/2 levels, to coordinate magnesium transport and reprogram cellular metabolism.",
