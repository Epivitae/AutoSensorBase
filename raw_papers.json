        "abstract": "Monitoring intracellular calcium is central to understanding cell signaling across nearly all cell types and organisms. Fluorescent genetically encoded calcium indicators (GECIs) remain the standard tools for in vivo calcium imaging, but require intense excitation light, leading to photobleaching, background autofluorescence and phototoxicity. Bioluminescent GECIs, which generate light enzymatically, eliminate these artifacts but have been constrained by low dynamic range and suboptimal calcium affinities. Here we show that CaBLAM ('calcium bioluminescence activity monitor'), an engineered bioluminescent calcium indicator, achieves an order-of-magnitude improvement in signal contrast and a tunable affinity matched to physiological cytosolic calcium. CaBLAM enables single-cell and subcellular activity imaging at video frame rates in cultured neurons and sustained imaging over hours in awake, behaving animals. These capabilities establish CaBLAM as a robust and general alternative to fluorescent GECIs, extending calcium imaging to regimes where excitation light is undesirable or infeasible.",

        "abstract": "Calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) signaling plays a pivotal role in determining B cell fate, shaping processes such as activation, differentiation, anergy or apoptosis. Upon B cell antigen receptor activation, Ca<sup>2+</sup> is rapidly mobilized from the endoplasmic reticulum and supplemented by Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx from the extracellular space, ultimately driving activation of various signaling pathways required for appropriate B cell responses. Although mitochondria also harbor significant levels of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, how mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics are regulated in B cells in response to activation or other cues remains unknown, as do the functional consequences of altered mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels. Chemical dyes as well as a genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor with a mitochondrial targeting sequence were used to study mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics in response to various stimuli. Proximity ligation assays were performed to assess interaction between mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum. Primary mouse B cells and the Burkitt lymphoma cell line Ramos were used to study functional consequences of the loss of the Mitochondrial Calcium Uniporter. Here, we show that mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels dynamically respond to cell activation, stress and metabolic cues and that mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake is largely dependent on the Mitochondrial Calcium Uniporter. Reduced mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake has a negative impact on mitochondrial activity and also affects cell signaling. These findings demonstrate that changes in mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> contribute to shaping functional B cell responses. The spatial and temporal dynamics of Ca<sup>2+</sup> accumulation within distinct subcellular compartments, particularly the cytosol, endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria, are essential for translating extracellular and intracellular signals into specific cellular outcomes. Our study provides new insights into the regulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis in B cells.",

However, these sensors are generally optimized for exponential growth rather than stationary phase where production occurs. Here, we find that our previously engineered E. coli green light sensor CcaSR, which functions robustly in exponential phase, fails in stationary phase due to spontaneous loss of an engineered chromophore biosynthetic pathway and accumulation of CcaS and CcaR. We optimize the genetic context and expression determinants of each component, resulting in a stable system named CcaSR<sub>stat</sub> that imposes little metabolic burden, exhibits low leakiness and an 80-fold green light response, and functions exclusively in stationary phase. We combine CcaSR<sub>stat</sub>-driven enzyme expression with varied static and periodic illumination patterns to achieve high titers of the industrially-relevant phenylpropanoid p-Coumaric acid and demonstrate that these optimizations scale to benchtop bioreactor conditions. Finally, we use CcaSR<sub>stat</sub> to optimize the expression level of a co-transcribed multi-enzyme metabolic pathway encoding production of plant-derived betaxanthin family pigments. Stationary phase-optimized bacterial sensors should enhance fermentation productivity by enabling rapid interrogation of the impact of enzyme expression level and induction dynamics.",

Cholinergic signaling in the striatum contributes to such flexible behavior, yet the timing and spatial organization of acetylcholine release during contingency changes remain unclear, limiting conceptual understanding of its role in behavioral flexibility. Using a genetically encoded acetylcholine sensor and 2-photon imaging in the dorsal striatum of behaving mice, we visualized acetylcholine dynamics during acquisition and reversal learning in a virtual reality Y-maze. Rewarded outcomes evoked phasic decreases in acetylcholine, whereas unexpected non-reward following reversal triggered widespread increases that predicted lose-shift behavior. Targeted inhibition of cholinergic interneurons reduced this adaptive response. Spatial analysis revealed heterogeneous, temporally distinct signals forming functionally diverse microdomains. These findings suggest that widespread and focal acetylcholine release during unexpected outcomes promotes adaptive response shifts, offering a mechanistic framework for understanding disorders such as addiction and obsessive-compulsive rituals.",

Here, we show that acid-sensing ion channel 3 (ASIC3) dramatically delays leukemogenesis. Asic3 deletion results in a remarkably enhanced self-renewal, reduced differentiation, and 9-fold greater number of murine acute myeloid LICs. We developed an ultrasensitive, ratiometric, genetically encoded fluorescent pH sensor (pHluorin3) and demonstrated that LICs prefer localizing in the endosteal niche with a neutral pH range of 7.34-7.42, but not in the vascular niche with a lower pH range of 6.89-7.22. Unexpectedly, acid-ASIC3 signaling inhibits both murine and human LIC activities in a noncanonical manner by interacting with the N-terminal of STIM1 to reduce calcium-mediated CAMK1-CREB-MEIS1-LDHA levels, without inducing cation currents. This study reveals a pathway in suppression of leukemogenesis in the acidic BM niche and provides insight into targeting LICs or other cancer stem cells through pH-dependent ASICs.",

        "abstract": "Myasthenia gravis is a rare autoimmune disease mediated by autoantibodies directed against acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) at the neuromuscular junction. These autoantibodies cause dysfunction through AChR blockade, AChR degradation due to crosslinking and internalisation, and complement activation. A novel in vitro model of the human neuromuscular junction was established on a microfluidic platform to investigate the effect of anti-AChR autoantibodies on complement activation and neuromuscular transmission and the mechanism of action of complement inhibition in myasthenia gravis. The NeuroMuscle<sup>TM</sup> platform enabled the connection of human induced pluripotent stem-cell-derived motor neuron spheroids with three-dimensional cultures of skeletal muscle fibres, forming functional neuromuscular junctions. Functional connectivity was assessed by glutamate stimulation of motor neuron spheroids and monitoring of calcium transients in genetically encoded calcium indicator protein 6 (GCaMP6)-transduced muscle fibres. Incubation of in vitro neuromuscular junction tissues with sera from patients with anti-AChR autoantibody-positive myasthenia gravis, in contrast to healthy controls, induced a significant increase in membrane attack complex (MAC) deposition and complement split products, accompanied by a notable reduction in calcium transients. Treatment with zilucoplan, a complement component 5 (C5) inhibitor, prevented complement activation and preserved neuromuscular junction functional integrity. The model demonstrated that complement-mediated damage is a major driver of neuromuscular junction functional impairment in the myasthenia gravis patient sera tested in this study. Furthermore, the study explored the reversibility of neuromuscular junction damage, revealing that shortening the delay before initiating complement inhibitor treatment in the in vitro neuromuscular junction tissues enhances the reversibility of neuromuscular transmission. These findings offer a mechanistic rationale for the observed clinical response in patients with anti-AChR autoantibody-positive myasthenia gravis treated with C5 inhibitors. The in vitro neuromuscular junction model provides a robust platform for studying the mechanistic pathways of complement-mediated damage and evaluating therapeutic interventions for myasthenia gravis.",

Here, a genetically encoded proximity labelling probe is presented that displays engineered ascorbate peroxidase, APEX2, on the surface of EVs via fusion to EV-sorting scaffold proteins. This enables the biotinylation of producer-cell-derived surface proteins, corona proteins, and interactors in vitro. After the enrichment by streptavidin bead pulldowns, subpopulation-specific, biotinylated surfaceome and interactome are comprehensively characterized using mass spectrometry-based proteomics. Thus, a genetic tool is introduced for the high-fidelity mapping of the surfaceome and cellular interactome of EVs in vitro.

        "abstract": "Mitochondrial dysfunction and defective mitophagy are defining features of numerous neurodegenerative and metabolic disorders, yet existing tools provide limited ability to quantify mitophagy dynamics in real time within living, post-mitotic cells. Here we present MitoFlare, a mitochondria-targeted, reversible mtROS-responsive fluorogenic probe that enables continuous, non-genetic visualization of mitochondrial oxidative activation and turnover. MitoFlare incorporates dual TEMPO nitroxide quenchers into a long-wavelength rhodamine scaffold, producing >95% basal quenching and rapid, fully reversible fluorescence activation in response to mitochondrial superoxide, hydroxyl radicals, lipid-derived peroxyl species, and peroxynitrite. When combined with LysoTracker Green, MitoFlare forms a dual-probe imaging platform that resolves the entire mitophagy cascade with high spatial and temporal fidelity in intact PC12 neuronal cells. Using this platform, we established a quantitative framework comprising three mechanistically distinct metrics: (i) a proximity index that reports early mitochondrial engagement with lysosomes, (ii) Manders' M1 coefficient that captures mid-stage mitochondria-lysosome fusion and mitophagosome formation, and (iii) a quenching/swelling index that resolves terminal lysosomal degradation. Nutrient deprivation induced a complete, temporally ordered mitophagy program, including mtROS priming, Parkin-OPTN-associated fusion, and efficient acidification-dependent cargo degradation. In contrast, inhibition of v-ATPase with bafilomycin A1 arrested mitophagy at the fusion stage, resulting in persistent redox-active mitochondrial cargo that failed to undergo lysosomal digestion. Importantly, MitoFlare's reversible redox chemistry uniquely revealed accumulation of undegraded, oxidatively active mitochondrial remnants within non-acidified vesicles-pathological intermediates that are undetectable using irreversible ROS dyes or genetically encoded reporters. These findings demonstrate that mitophagy proceeds through discrete, redox-regulated and lysosome-dependent phases that can be quantitatively mapped in real time. By enabling synchronized measurement of oxidative activation, organelle trafficking, fusion, and degradation, the MitoFlare-LysoTracker system establishes a new benchmark for dynamic mitophagy analysis in physiologically relevant models. This platform provides a powerful foundation for mechanistic interrogation of mitochondrial quality control and for accelerating the discovery of therapeutic strategies aimed at restoring mitophagic fidelity in neurodegenerative, cardiovascular, and metabolic diseases.",

        "abstract": "Voltage-sensing phosphatases (VSPs) provide a conserved framework for dissecting the mechanics of voltage sensing and for engineering genetically encoded voltage indicators (GEVIs). To evaluate how natural sequence diversity shapes function, we compared VSP voltage-sensing domains (VSDs) from multiple species by replacing the phosphatase domain with a fluorescent protein to enable optical detection of VSD responses. Every construct that reached the plasma membrane produced a voltage-dependent optical signal, underscoring the deep conservation of voltage sensing across VSP orthologs. Yet lineage-specific substitutions generated strikingly different phenotypes. A plankton VSP ortholog from <i>Eurytemora carolleeae</i> and the Sea Hare (<i>Aplysia californica</i>) VSP exhibited left-shifted activation ranges, producing robust fluorescence transitions during modest depolarizations of the plasma membrane. The human VSD of hVSP2 yielded weak, sluggish responses with poor recovery, but reintroduction of a conserved arginine in S1 (G95R) partially restored reversibility, implicating lipid-facing residues in conformational stability. The Chinese hamster (<i>Cricetulus griseus</i>) VSD, with atypical S4 sensing charges (RWIR), generated a slow fluorescence increase during depolarization, while reverting to the consensus arginine (RRIR) inverted the polarity to a decrease. These contrasting behaviors show that single residue changes can reshape how VSD movements influence the fluorescent reporter, highlighting the molecular precision revealed by GEVI measurements. Together, these results show that voltage-dependent signaling is deeply conserved across VSPs but shaped by lineage-specific sequence variation, establishing VSPs as powerful models for probing voltage sensing and guiding GEVI design.",

Functional assays to establish pathogenicity of human variants is a key limiting factor in the clinical interpretation of genetic findings. Methods based on radioactive [3H]-GABA uptake come with significant regulatory concerns, cost, and workflow complexity, which could be resolved by an alternate assay. To address this issue, we developed a high-content fluorescence imaging assay of GAT-1-mediated GABA uptake using a genetically encoded GABA sensor, iGABA-Snfr. We demonstrated that pathogenic variants strongly reduced uptake (mean, -89.4% [95% CI, -71.5% to -107.3%]). Some variants of uncertain significance (VUS) were associated with reduced GABA uptake (G111R, S459R, V511M; mean, -101.2% [95% CI -81.1% to -121.3%]), whereas others showed only mild reduction (R211C, R566H, F242V, R419C; mean, -33.6% [95% CI -17.2% to -50.1%]), supporting variant reclassification. Variant-specific effects on iGABA were highly correlated with the results of the radioactive [3H]-GABA assay (R<sup>2</sup>=0.8095, p<0.0001).

The ER is surrounded by a membrane that separates its lumen from the cytoplasm. The ER membrane harbors channels and pumps capable of controlling ion flux and creating a voltage gradient. Because the ER membrane potential is difficult to study experimentally little is known about how voltage influences its many vital functions. Here we introduce optical probes of ER membrane potential derived from the hybrid voltage sensor (hVoS) family of genetically-encoded voltage sensors. Probes were targeted to the ER using motifs from three ER proteins, Sec61β, cytochrome P450, and cytochrome b<sub>5</sub> type A. As shown recently with other types of ER voltage sensors, patch-clamp fluorometry recording with our new probes demonstrated that voltage steps applied to the plasma membrane elicit a voltage change at the ER membrane. These probes exhibited subtle differences in their responses suggesting they target different ER compartments. The steeper voltage dependence of Sec61β-hVoS (mCerulean3-Sec61β) signals suggested that this probe targets an ER compartment rich in voltage-gated ion channels. The ER voltage change is slow, but its onset is virtually synchronous with the plasma membrane voltage step. This suggests a direct electrical coupling into the ER lumen through plasma membrane-ER contacts. Analysis with the aid of an equivalent circuit provided an estimate of the resistance of these contacts. The rapid, direct transmission of voltage changes from the plasma membrane to the ER provides a mechanism for regulating ER function that could be especially important in excitable cells. The sensors introduced here provide researchers with powerful tools for imaging ER voltage and assessing its impact on cellular function.",

A new genetically encoded fluorescent biosensor based on Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) is composed of a JH-binding protein (JHBP) derived from <i>Bombyx mori</i>, which is fused with two fluorescent protein pairs (mTFP1 and mVenus) and exhibits a ratiometric readout. The mTFP1-JHBP-mVenus proteins, flanked by the two fluorescent proteins at the N- and C-termini, respectively, exhibited no discernible FRET as a primary FRET JH sensor. This suggests that inducible FRET by JH binding may have been compromised. Optimizing the insertion of mTFP1 into JHBP enabled inducible FRET in the presence of JH. The resulting construct, the FRET JH Indicator Agent (FREJIA), is the first ratiometric, genetically encoded, and fluorescent biosensor for JH detection. FREJIA interacts with the binding protein and emits a resonance energy transfer signal in response to binding to JH I, II, and III and methoprene at nanomolar ranges. FREJIA enables ratiometric imaging of JH III in live mammalian cells. Our results showed that FRET can be applied to the selective and ratiometric monitoring of JH levels.",

Sensor functionality was confirmed by measuring FRET responses to graded Pi supplies, revealing a consistent reduction in FRET ratios with increasing Pi concentrations, reflecting elevated cytosolic Pi levels. Comparisons with a Pi-insensitive FLIPPi variant confirmed the specificity of the observed changes. Furthermore, live imaging demonstrated rapid and dynamic alterations in cytosolic Pi upon treatment with defense-related hormones and elicitors of immune responses supporting a link between Pi signaling and plant immunity. Finally, the application of phosphite, an analog of Pi, altered Pi dynamics in both <i>Arabidopsis</i> and rice, suggesting an interference with Pi accumulation. Collectively, our findings establish FLIPPi as a reliable tool for in vivo monitoring of Pi in <i>Arabidopsis</i> and rice plants, the model systems for studies in dicotyledonous and monocotyledonous species, respectively.",

We have developed a second generation, genetically encoded intensity-based glucose sensing fluorescent reporter (iGlucoSnFR2). We show that when it is targeted to the cytosol, it reports intracellular glucose consumption and gluconeogenesis in cell culture, along with efflux from the endoplasmic reticulum. It outperforms the original iGlucoSnFR in vivo when observed by fiber photometry in mouse brain and reports transient increase in glucose concentration when stimulated by noradrenaline or electrical stimulation. Last, we demonstrate that membrane localized iGlucoSnFR2 can be calibrated in vivo to indicate absolute changes in extracellular glucose concentration in awake mice. We anticipate iGlucoSnFR2 facilitating previously unobservable measurements of glucose dynamics with high spatial and temporal resolution in living mammals and other experimental organisms.",

        "abstract": "Intracellular H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> levels are tightly regulated and can be modulated by various stimuli. A variety of nanozymes have been revealed with the ability to catalyze substrates of oxidoreductases, mostly including peroxidase (POD), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT), and some of them display multienzyme-like properties, which make them highly attractive for biomedical applications. However, the specific manifestations of nanozyemes within cells remain challenging to predict and detect. In this study, we developed a real-time, dynamic, and highly sensitive live-cell biosensor by expressing HyPer7 probe in the cytosol and mitochondria to monitor the cytosolic and mitochondrial H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> dynamics in a leukemia cell line THP-1. The successful expression of the probes in the cytosol and mitochondria was confirmed using confocal fluorescence microscopy. When the THP-1 cells were exposed to exogenous H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, the fluorescence intensity at 525 nm upon excitation with 405 nm lasers (referred to as F405) decreased, while that upon excitation with 488 nm lasers (referred to as F488) increased. Using this biosensor, we examined the dynamics of cytosolic and mitochondrial H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in response to Daunorubicin, Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> nanozyme with Polyetherimide (PEI)- or Dextran (Dex)-modification, and Prussian blue nanozyme with different diameters. Results indicated that the particle size of PBNPs and surface modification of Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> play critical roles in their intracellular effects on the aspect of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> modulation. The live-cell biosensors thus provide a powerful tool for detecting the variations of cytosolic and mitochondrial H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in response to nanozymes, thereby facilitating a better understanding of the biological effects of nanozymes and their potential biomedical applications.",

In this study, we developed four fluorescence-based biosensors for inhibitors of protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B), a therapeutic target for cancer and diabetes, and compared their performance in the presence of heterologous terpenoid pathways, a promising source of new inhibitors. When expressed in <i>Escherichia coli</i>, all four could reliably detect an exogenously supplied PTP1B inhibitor, but only one remained functional alongside terpenoid pathways, where pathway-derived stress reduced overall fluorescence. This sensor, which links PTP1B inhibition to the assembly of a split T7 RNA polymerase, exhibited a high dynamic range with minimal toxicity, a common liability of T7-based circuits. Variants of this sensor with different sensitivities to inhibition and stress allowed us to separate the terpenoid pathways that made PTP1B inhibitors from those that did not. Our findings show how pathway-specific stresses (e.g., terpene synthase expression) can alter biosensor signals as strongly as their target analytes and provide a framework for disentangling these confounding effects in high-throughput screens.",

        "abstract": "Here, we have linked one of the most common protein-protein interaction events, homodimerisation, to an essential trace metal, copper, through engineering green fluorescent protein. Mutation of H148 to cysteine promotes the neutral phenolic chromophore in the monomer that excites predominantly at ∼400 nm. Homodimerisation <i>via</i> a copper-dependent disulphide bridge switches the chromophore to the charged phenolate that excites at ∼490 nm. The result is a ∼30 fold increase in the fluorescence emission ratio. Homodimerisation kinetics are further improved by optimising the sfGFP homodimer interface, generating the variant termed GFP-diS2. Structures of the monomeric and dimeric GFP-diS2 suggest that charge switching is through peptide bond flipping and the formation of a buried organised water network around the chromophore that spans the interface region. Fusion to a leucine zipper protein dimerisation element greatly increased the GFP-diS2 association rate making it a more effective copper sensor <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> with Cu(i) instigating the signal change quicker and at lower ion concentrations than Cu(ii). Thus, GFP-diS2 provides the framework for generating a sensitive genetically encoded copper sensor and will eventually be adapted to monitor one of the most important protein-protein interactions in biology, homo-oligomerisation.",

Many reporter cell lines were created for generating phenotypic data in assigning the biological impact of large compound libraries. A major requirement of a phenotypic screen is the reporter cell lines for appropriate biomarkers with a good predictive value. Here, we have developed a stable cell expressing TagBFP2-53BP1 as a real-time sensor for DNA damage at the single-cell level that marks 53BP1 foci formation under physiological conditions, as well as toxicant-induced DNA damage. The cells were further engineered to report mitochondrial permeabilization using Smac-RFP, providing a broader application potential for this cellular model. Once the cells are further expressed with the autophagy marker EGFP-LC3, it is possible to image distinct cell fates such as autophagy, mitochondrial permeabilization, and DNA damage at the single-cell level. Using this system, we demonstrate that early cell death induced by telomerase inhibitors involves double-strand breaks and mitochondrial permeabilization. The model also enabled systematic profiling of several toxicants based on clearly noticeable cell fates. The approach of using live single-cell sensors for multiple distinct and diverse phenotypes offers great advantages over independent single-parameter-based assays, with the additional benefit of extracting heterogeneous cell responses over time, revealing more insight into the toxicity and mechanism of action for predictive applications.",

        "abstract": "The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) forms an elaborate contiguous network extending through the cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells. The ER is surrounded by a membrane that separates its lumen from the cytoplasm. The ER membrane harbors channels and pumps capable of controlling ion flux and creating a voltage gradient. Because the ER membrane potential is difficult to study experimentally, little is known about how voltage influences its many vital functions. Here, we introduce optical probes of ER membrane potential derived from the hybrid voltage sensor (hVoS) family of genetically encoded voltage sensors. Probes were targeted to the ER using motifs from three ER proteins, Sec61β, cytochrome P450, and cytochrome b<sub>5</sub> type A. As shown recently with other types of ER voltage sensors, patch-clamp fluorometry recording with our new probes demonstrated that voltage steps applied to the plasma membrane elicit a voltage change at the ER membrane. These probes exhibited subtle differences in their responses suggesting they target different ER compartments. The steeper voltage dependence of Sec61β-hVoS (mCerulean3-Sec61β) signals suggested that this probe targets an ER compartment rich in voltage-gated ion channels. The ER voltage change is slow, but its onset is virtually synchronous with the plasma membrane voltage step. This suggests a direct electrical coupling into the ER lumen through plasma membrane-ER contacts. Analysis with the aid of an equivalent circuit provided an estimate of the resistance of these contacts. The rapid, direct transmission of voltage changes from the plasma membrane to the ER provides a mechanism for regulating ER function that could be especially important in excitable cells. The sensors introduced here provide researchers with powerful tools for imaging ER voltage and assessing its impact on cellular function.",

        "abstract": "Many genetically encoded voltage indicators (GEVIs) rely on fluorescent protein (FP) domains to report changes in membrane potential. Rapid and reversible disruption of steady-state fluorescence during voltage sensor activation revealed transient conformational changes near the chromophore in the FP domain, implicating chromophore flexibility as a potential mechanism of signal modulation. Substitution of a bulky phenylalanine near the chromophore with threonine (F165T) introduced a distinct secondary component in the fluorescence response, consistent with increased chromophore mobility. This effect was tunable: an external, directionally polarized offset (164<i>T</i>/166F) reoriented the internal threonine side chain, restoring steric hindrance and eliminating the secondary signal. Thus, threonine can function as a context-sensitive molecular switch shaped by β-can surface chemistry. A second internal threonine (T203) also acted as a molecular switch under modified external conditions, generating a secondary signal that is susceptible to membrane curvature during depolarization suggesting that plasma membrane geometry can modulate GEVI activity under permissive conformational states. Crystal structures of Super Ecliptic pHluorin (SE), SE A227D, and a new FP variant revealed that external residues can influence internal side chain orientation. In the new variant, pH-dependent rearrangement of the seventh β-strand dramatically repositions D147 from the interior interacting with the chromophore to the external surface, while H148 shifts from the exterior to interact with the chromophore in alkaline conditions. These insights led to the development of a new GEVI, Ulla, which inverts the polarity of the optical signal─becoming brighter upon depolarization─displays reduced pH sensitivity in the physiological range, and performs reliably under low-light, high-speed imaging conditions in vitro and in vivo using widefield and 2-photon microscopy. Together, these findings present a new approach to modulating chromophore behavior offering broad potential for FP-based biosensor development.",

        "abstract": "Iron-sensing is evolutionarily conserved among life on Earth, and mammalian cells are known to sense cellular iron through mechanisms similar to bacteria and marine invertebrates. While iron regulatory proteins (IRPs) function as RNA-binding proteins during iron-limiting conditions and reflect cellular iron status, we lack genetically-encodeable tools to quantify bioavailable intracellular iron status over developmental time and at single-cell resolution. In order to better understand the cellular environment that supports or restricts IRP-active conditions, particularly during complex and dynamic changes leading to differentiated states, we present a ratiometric genetically-encoded biosensor called FEOX. FEOX is a ratiometric fluorescent biosensor of the cellular iron environment based on a mammalian hemerythrin-like domain, acting as an iron-dependent ligand-based regulatory switch. Compared to increased IRP activity in response to iron-limitation, FEOX dynamics demonstrate decreased ratiometric fluorescence representing decreased cellular iron during iron-limitation. Using FEOX we are able to quantify the dynamics of the bioavailable cellular iron environment during early stem cell differentiation by ratiometric measurements at single-cell resolution. Results from FEOX and from an IRP activity sensor during stem cell pluripotency transition and early differentiation provide orthogonal support for an increased iron demand state. Using these genetically-encodeable tools will allow greater insight into cellular iron homeostasis within mammalian systems. IRPs function as RNA-binding proteins during iron-limiting conditions, regulating the stability and translation of messenger RNAs that are essential for cellular iron homeostasis. However, to better understand and study the cell and molecular regulators of the iron-limiting conditions required for IRP RNA-binding activity, new tools are needed to monitor iron-responsive alterations in the intracellular environment at single-cell resolution and over developmental time. We devised a genetically-encoded biosensor called FEOX that depends on molecular iron interactions independent of IRP function and directly gauges bioavailable cellular iron.",

Herein, we construct a dual-color fluorogenic RNA biosensor based on a hairpin allosteric-driven transcription circuit for simple, sensitive, and label-free monitoring of miRNA and pre-miRNA in cells and tissues. In this biosensor, we elaborated a multifunctional hairpin probe that integrates target recognition, transcription amplification, and signal transduction without additional auxiliary primers. The presence of miR-155 and pre-miR-155 can initiate their corresponding hairpin allosteric-driven transcription circuit to generate abundant Corn and Pepper aptamers, respectively, which subsequently bind with DFHO and HBC620 to transmit high fluorescence signals. By leveraging the high specificity and amplification efficiency of hairpin allosteric-driven transcription circuit and superior signal-to-noise ratio of RNA aptamer-fluorophore complexes, this biosensor can achieve isothermal, one-step, and homogeneous detection of miRNA and pre-miR-155 with attomolar sensitivity. Moreover, it enables the accurate quantification of miRNA and pre-miR-155 at the single-cell level and discrimination of their expression profiles between breast cancer and healthy tissues.

        "abstract": "Dopamine (DA) is a critical neurotransmitter that regulates many physiological and behavioral processes. The central dopaminergic system plays a pivotal role in modulating general anesthesia (GA). DA release in the brain is mainly concentrated in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), prefrontal cortex, hypothalamus, and dorsal striatum. Several NAc neuron subtypes are essential for modulating states of consciousness during GA. However, whether NAc DA signal dynamics correlate with different states of consciousness under sevoflurane anesthesia remains to be elucidated. In this study, we measured the dynamic fluctuations of NAc DA levels throughout sevoflurane anesthesia to verify its role. An intensity-based genetically encoded DA indicator, dLight1.1, was employed to track DA release in the NAc. Fiber photometry combined with electroencephalogram/electromyogram recordings was employed to synchronously track NAc DA signal dynamics across different states of consciousness under sevoflurane anesthesia. Under 2.5% sevoflurane exposure, DA release in the NAc significantly increased during the initial 100 s of sevoflurane induction, which was designated as sevo on-1 (mean ± standard error of the mean [SEM]; baseline vs. sevo on-1, <i>p</i> = 0.0261), and continued to decrease in the subsequent anesthesia maintenance phases (sevo on-1 vs. sevo on-4, <i>p</i> = 0.0070). Following the cessation of sevoflurane administration (with intervals denoted as sevooff), NAc DA gradually returned to baseline levels (sevo on-1 vs. sevo off-1, <i>p</i> = 0.0096; sevo on-1 vs. sevo off-3, <i>p</i> = 0.0490; sevo on-1 vs. sevo off-4, <i>p</i> = 0.0059; sevo on-4 vs. sevo off-4, <i>p</i> = 0.0340; sevo off-1 vs. sevo off-4, <i>p</i> = 0.0451). During the induction phase, NAc DA signal dynamics markedly increased during the pre-loss of consciousness (LOC) period (pre-anesthesia baseline vs. pre-LOC, <i>p</i> = 0.0329) and significantly declined after LOC (pre-LOC vs. post-LOC, <i>p</i> = 0.0094). For the emergence period, NAc DA release exhibited a noticeable increase during the initial period after recovery of consciousness (ROC) (anesthesia baseline vs. post-ROC, <i>p</i> = 0.0103; pre-ROC vs. post-ROC, <i>p</i> = 0.0086). Furthermore, the DA signals peaked rapidly upon the initiation of the burst wave and then gradually attenuated, indicating a positive correlation with the burst wave onset during burst suppression events. Our findings revealed that NAc DA neurotransmitter signal dynamics correlate with different states of consciousness throughout sevoflurane anesthesia.",

To elucidate the dynamic role of α-MSH release in regulating appetite, specific, sensitive, and spatiotemporally resolved genetic sensors are required. The melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) scaffold was leveraged for its robust plasma membrane expression, high affinity for melanocortins and low affinity for AgRP to design a α-MSH selective sensor for in vivo use. This was achieved by integrating circularly permuted green fluorescent protein (cpGFP) into the receptor, which we named Fluorescence Amplified Receptor sensor for Melanocortin (FLARE<sub>MC</sub>). The FLARE<sub>MC</sub> sensor has high potency and selectivity in heterologous and homologous expressing cells for α-MSH and the synthetic melanocortin agonist MTII but not to the inverse agonist AgRP. The sensor exhibited impaired signaling, with reduced G protein activation, no β-arrestin coupling, and failed to internalize upon agonist stimulation. In vitro, FLARE<sub>MC</sub> displayed high photostability and reversible photoactivation. These properties suggest that the FLARE<sub>MC</sub> is suitable for long-term activity recording in the brain without desensitizing or interfering with endogenous melanocortin receptor signaling. When expressed in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the mouse hypothalamus, the primary site of anorexigenic α-MSH signaling, FLARE<sub>MC</sub> demonstrated its effectiveness in detecting changes associated with melanocortin responses in vivo. FLARE<sub>MC</sub> enables the study of melanocortin system in cultured cells and in vivo. This first of its class highly sensitive melanocortin sensor will serve as a valuable tool to advance our understanding of the complex dynamics governing melanocortin-dependent appetite regulation and related processes in the brain.",

        "abstract": "Live-cell imaging of intracellular proteins enables real-time observation of protein dynamics under near-physiological conditions, providing pivotal insights for both fundamental life science research and medical applications. However, due to limitations such as poor probe permeability and cytotoxicity associated with conventional antibody-based or genetically encoded labeling techniques, live-cell imaging remains a significant challenging. To address these limitations, here in this study, we developed and rigorously validated a novel aptamer-based fluorescent probe for real-time imaging of NEK9 kinase in living cells. First, through <i>in vitro</i> capture-SELEX, a DNA aptamer termed as Apt-011 which could selectively bind NEK9 was identified. Further, capitalizing on the small size, low immunogenicity, and synthetic flexibility of aptamers, we engineered a \"signal-on\" NEK9-specific aptamer-based fluorescent probe platform. This design leverages the aptamer's target--induced conformational change to physically separate the fluorophore-quencher pair, and it has been validated that this fluorescent probe platform could successfully visualize intracellular NEK9 in live-cells without obvious cytotoxicity (cell viability > 95% at working concentrations), offering new opportunities to study NEK9-associated signaling pathways. This work not only provides a robust tool for kinase research but also establishes a generalizable strategy to overcome key bottlenecks in live-cell imaging through rational aptamer engineering.",

        "abstract": "Agonist-induced interaction of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) with β-arrestins (βarrs) is a critical mechanism that regulates the spatiotemporal pattern of receptor localization and signaling. While the underlying mechanism governing GPCR-βarr interaction is primarily conserved and involves receptor activation and phosphorylation, there are several examples of receptor-specific fine-tuning of βarr-mediated functional outcomes. Considering the key contribution of conformational plasticity of βarrs in driving receptor-specific functional responses, it is important to develop novel sensors capable of reporting distinct βarr conformations in cellular context. Here, we design an intrabody version of a βarr-recognizing nanobody (nanobody32), referred to as intrabody32 (Ib32), in NanoLuc enzyme complementation assay format and measure its ability to recognize βarr1 and 2 in live cells upon activation of a broad set of GPCRs. Ib32 robustly recognizes activated βarr1 and 2 in the plasma membrane and endosomes, and effectively mirrors βarr recruitment profile upon stimulation of selected GPCRs. We also design an Ib32 sensor for polarization microscopy with a change in linear dichroism as readout and demonstrate its utility for monitoring βarr activation upon stimulation of selected GPCRs by natural and biased agonists. Taken together with a previously described sensor of βarr1 activation, Ib32 underscores the inherent flexibility encoded in βarrs and conformational diversity imparted by different GPCRs, which is further corroborated using an orthogonal limited proteolysis assay. Our study presents Ib32 as a sensor of βarr activation and highlights the structural diversity of βarrs, which likely allows their ability to interact with, and regulate, a large repertoire of GPCRs.",

The sensor exhibited a high signal-to-noise ratio, nanomolar affinity, rapid temporal resolution, and submicrometer spatial resolution that collectively enabled precise mapping of chemokine dynamics. Using LoX3-1.0, we monitored the temporal patterns of chemokines shaped by distinct inflammatory states and quantitatively revealed the multidimensional features of chemokine signaling and its potential organizational principles. In vivo, we directly visualized micrometer-scale CXCL10 gradients and their evolution surrounding blood vessels during brain neuroinflammation and also tracked the injury-induced CXCL10 dynamics in the peripheral skin of mice.

However, it has remained difficult to measure intracellular H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> with high specificity and in a quantitative manner. Here, we present a detailed protocol for a chemogenetic method that enables the detection and quantitation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in living cells by converting intracellular H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> into fluorescent or luminescent signals. This is achieved by expressing the engineered heme peroxidase APEX2 in cells and subcellular locations of interest and by providing an appropriate fluorogenic or luminogenic substrate from outside. This method differs fundamentally from previously developed genetically encoded H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> probes; those are reversible and measure the balance between probe thiol oxidation and reduction. By contrast, APEX2 turns over its substrate irreversibly and therefore directly measures endogenous H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> availability. Our detailed step-by-step protocol covers the generation of APEX2-expressing cell lines, the implementation of fluorescent and luminescent measurements and examples for application. Ectopic expression of APEX2 can be achieved in 3 days, while the actual measurements typically require 1-2 h. This protocol is intended for entry-level scientists.",

To address this gap, this research explored the impact of PeAE and PAE on CIN populations and activity, cognitive flexibility, and compulsive drinking behaviors in adult offspring. We first assessed CIN number by staining striatal sections for choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) and observed a significant reduction in CINs within the posterior striatum of adult PeAE offspring.

Behaviorally, PeAE offspring exhibited a significant deficit in adapting to reversed action-outcome contingencies despite intact initial learning capabilities. Moreover, PeAE mice exhibited compulsive alcohol drinking behavior, characterized by elevated consumption and preference for quinine-adulterated alcohol.

        "abstract": "The neurobiology of chronic pain is complex and multifaceted, intertwining with the mesocorticolimbic system to regulate the behavioral and perceptional response to adverse stimuli. Specifically, the ventral tegmental area (VTA), the dopaminergic hub of the reward pathways located deep within the midbrain, is crucial for regulating the release of dopamine (DA) throughout the central nervous system (CNS). To better understand the nuances among chronic pain, VTA response, and therapeutics, implementing progressive approaches for mapping and visualizing the deep brain in real time during nociceptive stimulation is crucial. In this study, we utilize a fluorescence imaging platform with a genetically encoded calcium indicator (GCaMP6s) to directly visualize activity in the VTA during acute nociceptive stimulation in both healthy adult mice and adult mice with partial nerve ligation (PNL)-induced neuropathic pain. We also investigate the visualization of the analgesic properties of morphine. Deep brain imaging using our self-fabricated µ-complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) imaging device allows the tracking of the VTA's response to adverse stimuli. Our findings show that nociceptive stimulation is associated with a reduction in VTA fluorescence activity, supporting the potential of this platform for visualizing pain-related responses in the central nervous system. Additionally, treatment with morphine significantly reduces the neuronal response caused by mechanical stimuli and is observable using the CMOS imaging platform, demonstrating a novel way to potentially assess and treat neuropathic pain.",

Recent studies suggest that the localization of aquaporin-4 (AQP4) in astrocytic endfeet plays a crucial role in regulating blood-brain water transport and cell volume control, particularly along perivascular pathways. However, the signaling mechanisms underlying AQP4 localization remain poorly understood. In this study, we utilized the genetically encoded fluorescent calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) indicator GCaMp6f to investigate Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in astrocytic somata, processes, and endfeet during SE induction and observed enhanced Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in both the somata and perivascular endfeet of astrocytes. We employed genetic knockout of TRPM4 (Trpm4 <sup>-/-</sup> ) and glibenclamide treatment to explore the role of sulfonylurea receptor 1 transient receptor potential melastatin-4 (SUR1-TRPM4) channel in these Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses. Both approaches significantly suppressed the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in the astrocytic endfeet and reduced perivascular expression of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-related signaling pathway sensor calmodulin (CaM). Furthermore, we found that AQP4 localization was no longer confined to the domains of astrocytic endfeet following SE. Inhibition of SUR1-TRPM4 through pharmacological blockade or gene deletion restored the subcellular localization of AQP4, reduced cerebral edema, and improved cognitive outcomes post-SE. Our findings suggest that SUR1-TRPM4 plays a pivotal role in regulating astrocytic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals and mediating the aberrant expression and subcellular localization of astrocytic AQP4 along perivascular pathways.

Therefore, we used the novel genetically-encoded histamine sensor, HisLightG, combined with fiber photometry to measure histamine release in two hypothalamic regions critical for the food-suppressive effects of histamine, the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVH), and the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH). Male mice were tested under different conditions to assess whether hunger, time of day, or the caloric content of the solution they were given affected histamine fluctuations. We found that histamine levels changed rapidly in response to eating. These histamine fluctuations were influenced by experimental conditions, with slightly smaller responses when the test solution was sucralose (both regions) or during the light cycle (PVH only). Notable regional differences were identified, such that in the PVH histamine rebounded to above baseline levels, whereas in the VMH histamine remained lower than baseline for at least 10 s after licking ceased. In a separate cohort of male and female mice, enhancing histamine tone via administration of a histamine precursor (L-histidine) reduced the number of licks across multiple sucrose concentrations. Together, these findings indicate that histaminergic activity is modulated rapidly during ingestive episodes, and that understanding these release patterns will give insight into histamine's role in appetite suppression.",

Based on NanoLuc luciferase complementation (NanoBiT), LAMP sensors are small (22 kD) and provide stable and bright light output that decreases upon phosphorylation and increases upon dephosphorylation. In this report, we designed LAMP biosensors to report spatial and temporal dynamics of cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) signaling. By incorporating both PKA phosphorylation and protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) dephosphorylation motifs into the small component of split NanoLuc (generating PKABiT/pBiT), we achieved a sevenfold dynamic range. LAMP sensors are modular and flexible, allowing the two components, LgBiT and pBiT, to be expressed as part of the same polypeptide (cis) or as part of separate, but interacting polypeptides (trans). With trans LAMP, we show that RIα and RIβ form heterodimers with activities indistinguishable from homodimers of the two PKA regulatory subunit isoforms. Cis PKA LAMP sensors revealed different activation and inactivation kinetics of endogenous, membrane anchored PKA/RI and PKA/RII holoenzymes. They also allowed us to measure kinetics of cAMP diffusion and PKA catalytic subunit translocation to the nucleus. Finally, we used a regeneratively phosphorylated PKA LAMP sensor to identify an autoinhibitory sequence in the PP2A regulatory subunit B56δ.

To date, no versatile technology has been developed to directly label and visualize an active replicase in live plant cells because, in general, replicase function is not retained when it is fused to a protein for fluorescence imaging. We developed a technique to label and image a plant virus replicase during infection using the transiently expressed human influenza hemagglutinin (HA) frankenbody (FB), an antibody fragment that binds the HA epitope. The function of FB was demonstrated by visualizing the targeting of mCherry-fused FB (FB-mCherry) to an HA-tagged and GFP-fused endoplasmic reticulum (ER) marker protein in its native location. The combination of a two-component inducible system with the FB probe enabled FB-mCherry to label an HA epitope-tagged, functional replicase of Plantago asiatica mosaic virus (PlAMV) during its infection in Nicotiana benthamiana cells without affecting virus replication efficiency. The HA-tagged PlAMV replicase forms punctate structures associated with the ER and plasmodesmata and is localized in the vicinity of dsRNA, a hallmark of a viral replication complex. This application of epitope tag-binding intracellular probes for live subcellular imaging in plant cells offers insights into the localization dynamics of an active plant virus replicase during infection and the potential to co-localize host factors with the active replicase in situ.",

        "abstract": "Protein poly-ADP-ribosylation (PARylation) is a post-translational modification formed by transferring successive units of ADP-ribose to target proteins to form poly-ADP-ribose (PAR) chains. PAR plays a critical role in the DNA damage response (DDR) by acting as a signaling platform to promote the recruitment of DNA repair factors to the sites of DNA damage that bind via their PAR-binding domains (PBDs). Several classes of PBD families have been identified, which recognize distinct parts of the PAR chain. Proteins encoding PBDs play an essential role in conveying the PAR-mediated signal through their interaction with PAR chains, which mediates many cellular functions, including the DDR. The WWE domain, encoded in 12 human proteins, identifies the iso-ADP-ribose moiety of the PAR chain. PARylation is a heterogeneous structure that is highly dynamic in cells. Capturing the dynamics of PARylation is essential to understanding its role in the DDR, which can be achieved by expanding the tool kit for PAR detection and tracking mediated by the unique binding capability of various sensors. We recently described the WWE domain of RNF146 as a robust genetically encoded probe, when fused to EGFP, for the detection of PAR in live cells. Expanding on this, we used structural prediction tools to evaluate all of the WWE domains encoded in human proteins, evaluating each as molecular PAR probes in live cells. We demonstrate unique PAR dynamics when tracked by WWE-encoded PAR binding domains, in addition to an engineered macrodomain, that can be exploited for modulation of the PAR-dependent DNA damage response.",

Excessive light can impair growth or induce cell death, making it essential for plants to detect and respond to light fluctuations. While Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling has been linked to high light (HL) acclimation, the subcellular dynamics remain unclear. Here, we investigate Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses to HL exposure in Arabidopsis thaliana. Using a glass bead to simulate light-focusing by water droplets, a biphasic increase of Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration was detected in the chloroplast stroma by the genetically encoded calcium indicator YC3.6 and confirmed using a newly established stroma-localized R-GECO1 (NTRC-R-GECO1). The stromal response was largely independent of light wavelength and unaffected in phot1 phot2 and cry1 cry2 mutants. Chemical inhibition of photosynthetic electron transport, microscopy-based Fv/Fm experiments, and measurement of the reactive oxygen species (ROS)-redox balance with roGFP-based reporters and Singlet Oxygen Sensor Green (SOSG) chemical dye suggested that photodamage and singlet oxygen contribute to the stromal Ca<sup>2+</sup> response.

Genetically tagging fluorescent RNA reporters to an RNA of interest allows for investigating RNA spatiotemporal dynamics. We previously developed a fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM)-based RNA-tagging platform, Riboglow-FLIM. Here, a genetically encoded RNA tag binds a fluorescent probe, causing an increase in both fluorescence intensity and fluorescence lifetime. Importantly, the Riboglow platform is derived from a bacterial riboswitch RNA family and different riboswitch sequences from nature may build the basis for multiplexing capabilities. We previously observed fluorescence lifetime differences for two RNA tags <i>in vitro</i> and in live mammalian cells as a proof-of-concept demonstration. As an in-depth expansion for multiplexing capabilities, here we evaluate the performance of different RNA sequences <i>in vitro</i> for systematically expanding the RNA tag sequence space of Riboglow-FLIM. We use two methods of varying the genetic tag to evaluate multiplexing capabilities, a literature-guided and a rational design approach. The literature-guided approach includes riboswitch sequences with both indirect and direct evidence of probe binding. For this, a phylogenetic tree of riboswitch-derived tags from indirect binding results was constructed, and RNA members from different branches were characterized. We also designed RNA mutations rationally based on insights from established Riboglow RNA tags. Together, nine different RNA tags yielded a wide range of fluorescence lifetimes for the Riboglow-FLIM platform, building the foundation to tag and track several different RNAs simultaneously. These findings will serve as the basis for achieving multiplexed RNA imaging in live cells using a fluorescence lifetime sensor.",

Commonly, DPP8/9 activity is analysed by in vitro assays using artificial substrates, which allow neither continuously monitoring DPP8/9 activity in individual, living cells nor detecting effects from endogenous interactors and posttranslational modifications. Here, we developed DiPAK (for DPP8/9 activity sensor based on AK2), a ratiometric genetically encoded fluorescent sensor, which enables studying DPP8/9 activity in living cells. Using DiPAK, we determined the dynamic range of DPP8/9 activity in cells overexpressing or lacking DPP9. We identified distinct activity levels among melanoma cell lines and found that LPS-induced primary B-cell activation depends on DPP8/9 as the absence of DPP8/9 activity results in apoptotic but not pyroptotic cell death. Consistently, we observed increasing DPP8/9 activity during B-cell maturation.

HypnoS enables real-time visualization of iAdo dynamics in live cultures, acute brain slices, flies, and freely moving mice. Using HypnoS for dual-color mesoscopic imaging in mice, we show that seizure-induced iAdo waves propagated across the cortex, following calcium signals. Additionally, two-photon imaging reveals that iAdo decays more rapidly in astrocytes than in neurons during seizures. Moreover, by recording iAdo dynamics in the basal forebrain during the sleep-wake cycle, we observe that iAdo signals are present during wakefulness and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, regulated by equilibrative nucleoside transporters (ENT1/2).

Here, we optimized two biosensors for thiol-disulfide redox (RoTq-Off and RoTq-On) with opposite changes in fluorescence lifetime in response to oxidation. Using biophysical approaches, we showed that the high-lifetime states of these sensors lock the chromophore more firmly in place than their low-lifetime states do. Two-photon fluorescence lifetime imaging of RoTq-On fused to a glutaredoxin (Grx1) enabled robust, straightforward monitoring of cytosolic glutathione redox state in acute mouse brain slices.

However, progress in developing red-shifted GECIs, despite their advantages over green indicators, has been slower, resulting in fewer options for end users. In this study, we explored topological inversion and soma-targeting strategies, which are complementary to conventional mutagenesis, to re-engineer a red genetically encoded calcium indicator, FRCaMP, for enhanced in vivo performance. The resulting sensors, FRCaMPi and soma-targeted FRCaMPi (SomaFRCaMPi), exhibit up to 2-fold higher dynamic range and peak ΔF/F0 per single AP compared to widely used jRGECO1a in neurons both in culture and in vivo. Compared to jRGECO1a and FRCaMPi, SomaFRCaMPi reduces erroneous correlation of neuronal activity in the brains of mice and zebrafish by two- to 4-fold due to diminished neuropil contamination without compromising the signal-to-noise ratio. Under wide-field imaging in primary somatosensory and visual cortices in mice with high labeling density (80-90%), SomaFRCaMPi exhibits up to 40% higher SNR and decreased artifactual correlation across neurons. Altogether, SomaFRCaMPi improves the accuracy and scale of neuronal activity imaging at single-neuron resolution in densely labeled brain tissues due to a 2-3-fold enhanced automated neuronal segmentation, 50% higher fraction of responsive cells, up to 2-fold higher SNR compared to jRGECO1a.

In this study, we investigated the impact of Q10 on the spatio-temporal patterns of cellular energetics in keratinocyte-derived HaCaT cells, utilizing the genetically-encoded FRET sensor AMPfret. Engineered from the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), this sensor leverages endogenous affinities of the kinase that evolved to detect energy stress, specifically decreases in ATP/ADP and ATP/AMP ratios that pose a threat to cell survival. We successfully established HaCaT cells stably expressing AMPfret, validated their functionality by inducing energy stress with 2-deoxy-D-glucose, and demonstrated that Q10, together with high glucose conditions in culture, can enhance cellular energetics compared to low glucose controls. We then employed AMPfret to analyze the spatio-temporal response of HaCaT keratinocytes to Luperox (tert-butyl peroxide), a potent organic prooxidant, in the presence of varying intracellular levels of Q10. Preloading cells with Q10 was protective, slowing the speed and reducing the extend of the energy stress response. In contrast, preincubation with Simvastatin, an inhibitor of the mevalonate Q10 biosynthesis pathway, depleted cellular Q10 levels, accelerated the onset of energy stress, and led to early cell death as compared to controls. Under all conditions, AMPfret revealed cell-to-cell heterogeneity in energy stress at baseline and in the response to Luperox. Overall, tracking changes in energy state in time and at single-cell level allows further insights into the beneficial role of Q10 in enhancing cellular bioenergetics in skin cells, and a potential role of AMPK in mediating responses to altered Q10 levels.",

While conventional fluorescent proteins typically exhibit nanosecond-scale lifetimes, the development of proteins with longer lifetimes enables time-resolved detection and enhanced signal-to-noise ratios. Here, we designed a novel phosphorescent protein system by incorporating photosensitizing unnatural amino acids (UAAs) proximal to the metal center of a lanthanide binding protein (LanM). Through systematic optimization of the incorporation sites, we achieved considerable enhancement in lanthanide phosphorescence compared with that of the wild-type LanM protein. The subsequent directed evolution of LanM and chemical evolution of UAA yielded variants with an additional muti-fold increase in signal intensity. This iterative optimization strategy generated phosphorescent proteins with extended lifetimes of up to 500 μs and significantly increased brightness. Using this phosphorescence protein platform, a europium sensor with a signal-to-noise ratio of more than 100 for 200 nM Eu(III) and a detection limit of less than 10 nM was developed. In addition, a protease sensor was further designed by inserting a cleavage site into a loop of the phosphorescent protein, achieving remarkable signal-to-noise ratios at nanomolar concentrations. Finally, this phosphorescent protein was fused to the affibody and further used for immunofluorescence imaging. These applications demonstrated a novel platform for developing genetically encoded sensors with enhanced detection sensitivity through time-resolved measurements.",

The sampled mutational landscape unveils an evolutionary convergent solution at one position in the anion binding pocket and nine other mutations across eight positions, of which only one has been previously linked to chloride sensing potential in the GFP family.",

        "abstract": "The spatiotemporal organization of the postsynaptic density (PSD) is a fundamental determinant of synaptic transmission, information processing, and storage in the brain. The major bottleneck that prevents the direct and precise representation of the nanometer-scaled organization of excitatory glutamatergic synapses is the size of antibodies, nanobodies, and the genetically encoded fluorescent tags. Here, we introduce small, high affinity synthetic probes for simplified, high contrast visualization of excitatory synapses without the limitations of larger biomolecules. In vitro binding quantification together with microscopy-based evaluation identified eSylites, a series of fluorescent bivalent peptides comprising a dye, linker, and sequence composition that show remarkable cellular target selectivity. Applied on primary neurons or brain slices at nanomolar concentrations, eSylites specifically report PSD-95, the key orchestrator of glutamate receptor nanodomains juxtaposed to the presynaptic glutamate release sites that mediate fast synaptic transmission. The eSylite design minimizes a spatial dye offset and thereby enables visualization of PSD-95 with improved localization precision and further time-resolved discrimination. In particular, we find that individual dendritic spines can contain separate nanodomains enriched for either PSD-95 or its closest homologues, PSD-93 or SAP102. Collectively, these data establish eSylites as a broadly applicable tool for simplified excitatory synapse visualization, as well as a high-end microscopy compatible probe for resolving the PSD organization with unprecedented resolution.",

In addition to fluorescence imaging, certain chemical bond vibrations are sensitive to membrane potential changes, presenting an alternative imaging strategy; however, challenges in signal sensitivity and membrane specificity highlight the need to develop vibrational spectroscopic GEVIs (vGEVIs) in mammalian cells. To address this need, a vGEVI screening approach is developed that employs hyperspectral stimulated Raman scattering (hSRS) imaging synchronized with an induced transmembrane voltage (ITV) stimulation, revealing unique spectroscopic signatures of sensors expressed on membranes. Specifically, by screening various rhodopsin-based voltage sensors in live mammalian cells, a characteristic peak associated with retinal bound to the sensor is identified in one of the GEVIs, Archon, which exhibited a 70 cm<sup>-1</sup> red shift relative to the membrane-bound retinal. Notably, this peak is responsive to changes in membrane potential. Overall, hSRS-ITV presents a promising platform for screening vGEVIs, paving the way for advancements in vibrational spectroscopic voltage imaging.",

Therefore, we used the novel genetically-encoded histamine sensor, HisLightG, combined with fiber photometry to measure histamine release in two hypothalamic regions critical for the food-suppressive effects of histamine, the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVH), and the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH). Male mice were tested under different conditions to assess whether hunger, time of day, or the caloric content of the solution they were given affected histamine fluctuations. We found that histamine levels changed rapidly in response to eating. These histamine fluctuations were influenced by experimental conditions, with slightly smaller responses when the test solution was sucralose (both regions) or during the light cycle (PVH only). Notable regional differences were identified, such that in the PVH histamine rebounded to baseline levels, whereas in the VMH histamine remained lower than baseline for at least 10 seconds after licking ceased. In a separate cohort of male and female mice, enhancing histamine tone via administration of a histamine precursor (L-histidine) reduced the number of licks across multiple sucrose concentrations. Together, these findings indicate that histaminergic activity is modulated rapidly during ingestive episodes, and that understanding these release patterns will give insight into histamine's role in appetite suppression.",

Here, we present the development and characterization of a genetically encoded fluorescent sensor of D-2-HG (D2HGlo). D2HGlo responds to clinically relevant concentrations of D-2-HG, demonstrates exceptional selectivity and can quantify D-2-HG in various body fluids and glioma tumor supernatants. Additionally, analysis of tumor lysates using D2HGlo accurately predicted the IDH mutational status of gliomas. The successful quantification of D-2-HG within contrived samples suggests that D2HGlo may facilitate the detection and monitoring of IDH mutant cancers through liquid biopsies following further validation. In addition to D2HGlo's potential clinical utility, we also present findings for its adaptation to the cellular environment. To assess D-2-HG production in living immortalized glioma cells, we engineered D2HGlo sensors that localize to subcellular compartments, which yielded findings of elevated D-2-HG in the cytosol, mitochondria, and nucleus of IDH1 mutant cells. D2HGlo was used to perform a side-by-side comparison of cytosolic and secreted D-2-HG to reveal that glycolysis, but not glutamine catabolism, drives D-2-HG production in IDH1 mutant cells.",

To address these limitations, we have developed a novel protocol utilizing genetically encoded voltage indicators (GEVIs).

Among GEVIs, near-infrared-shifted GEVIs offer faster kinetics, better tissue penetration, and compatibility with optogenetic tools, enabling all-optical electrophysiology in complex biological contexts. In our previous work, we employed the directed molecular evolution of microbial rhodopsin Archaerhodopsin-3 (Arch-3) in mammalian cells to develop a voltage sensor called Archon1. Archon1 demonstrated excellent membrane localization, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), sensitivity, kinetics, and photostability, and full compatibility with optogenetic tools. However, Archon1 suffers from low brightness and requires high illumination intensities, which leads to tissue heating and phototoxicity during prolonged imaging. In this study, we aim to improve the brightness of this voltage sensor. We performed random mutation on a bright Archon derivative and identified a novel variant, monArch, which exhibits satisfactory voltage sensitivity (4~5% ΔF/F<sub>AP</sub>) and a 9-fold increase in basal brightness compared with Archon1. However, it is hindered by suboptimal membrane localization and compromised voltage sensitivity.

        "abstract": "Neuronal communication is mediated by synaptic transmission, which depends primarily on the release of neurotransmitters stored in synaptic vesicles (SVs) in response to an action potential (AP). Since SVs are recycled locally at the presynaptic terminal, coordination of SV exocytosis and endocytosis is important for sustained synaptic transmission. A pH-sensitive green fluorescent protein, called pHluorin, provides a powerful tool to monitor SV exo/endocytosis by targeting it to the SV lumen. However, tracking AP-driven SV recycling with the pHluorin-based probes is still largely limited to in vitro culture preparations because the introduction of genetically encoded probes and subsequent optical imaging is technically challenging in general for in vivo animal models or tissue preparations. Zebrafish is a model system offering valuable features, including ease of genetic manipulation, optical clarity, and rapid external development. We recently generated a transgenic zebrafish that highly expresses a pHluorin-labeled probe at motor neuron terminals and developed a protocol to monitor AP-driven SV exo/endocytosis at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ), a well-established synapse model that forms in vivo. In this article, we show how to prepare larval zebrafish NMJ preparation suitable for pHluorin imaging. We also show that the preparation allows time-lapse imaging under conventional upright epifluorescence microscope, providing a cost-effective platform for analyzing NMJ function.",

In this study, we explored topological inversion and soma-targeting strategies, which are complementary to conventional mutagenesis, to re-engineer a red genetically encoded calcium indicator, FRCaMP, for enhanced <i>in vivo</i> performance. The resulting sensors, FRCaMPi and soma-targeted FRCaMPi (SomaFRCaMPi), exhibit up to 2-fold higher dynamic range and peak ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> per single AP compared to widely used jRGECO1a in neurons in culture and <i>in vivo</i>.

This assay enables screening of membrane micropeptides and small molecules that modulate SERCA and Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase activity and may facilitate development of therapies that target cellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling. Of the micropeptides tested, phospholamban (PLB) had the greatest degree of inhibition of SERCA, as measured by a decrease in ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> content compared to control. Sarcolipin (SLN), endoregulin (ELN), and another-regulin (ALN) also decreased ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> content, though less potently than PLB.

The sensor, \"PancACe,\" has a maximum change of ∼2-fold and a response range of ∼10 μM-2 mM acetyl-CoA.

Despite the significant role of Pi, its distribution and response dynamics in mycorrhizal roots remain largely unexplored. While traditional techniques for Pi measurement have shed some light on this, real-time cellular-level monitoring has been a challenge. With the evolution of quantitative imaging with confocal microscopy, particularly the use of genetically encoded fluorescent sensors, live imaging of intracellular Pi concentrations is now achievable. Among these sensors, fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based biosensors stand out for their accuracy. In this study, we employ the Pi-specific biosensor (cpFLIPPi-5.3m) targeted to the cytosol or plastids of <i>Brachypodium distachyon</i> plants, enabling us to monitor intracellular Pi dynamics during AM symbiosis. A complementary control sensor, cpFLIPPi-Null, is introduced to monitor non-Pi-specific changes.

        "abstract": "Oxidative stress is a prominent feature of Alzheimer's disease. Within this context, cholesterol undergoes oxidation, producing the pro-inflammatory product 7-ketocholesterol (7-KC). In this study, we observe elevated levels of 7-KC in the brains of the 3xTg mouse model of AD. To further understand the contribution of 7-KC on the oxidative environment, we developed a method to express a genetically encoded fluorescent hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) sensor in astrocytes, the primary source of cholesterol in the brain. With this sensor, we discovered that 7-KC increases H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> levels in astrocytes in vivo, but not when directly applied to astrocytes in vitro. Interestingly, when 7-KC was applied to a microglia cell line alone or mixed astrocyte and microglia cultures, it resulted in microglia activation and increased oxidative stress in astrocytes. Depletion of microglia from 3xTg mice resulted in reduced 7-KC in the brains of these mice. Taken together, these findings suggest that 7-KC, acting through microglia, contributes to increased astrocyte oxidative stress in AD. This study sheds light on the complex interplay between cholesterol oxidation, microglia activation, and astrocyte oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of AD.",

        "abstract": "The persistence of cocaine-evoked adaptations relies on gene regulations within the reward circuit, especially in the ventral striatum (i.e., nucleus accumbens [NAc]). Notably, activation of the ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) pathway in the striatum is known to trigger a transcriptional program shaping long-term responses to cocaine. Nuclear calcium signaling has also been shown to control multiple forms of transcription-dependent neuroadaptations, but the dynamics and roles of striatal nuclear calcium signaling in preclinical models of addiction remain unknown. A genetically encoded cell type-specific nuclear calcium probe has been developed to monitor calcium dynamics in the nuclei of striatal neurons, including in freely moving mice. A cell type-specific inhibitor of nuclear calcium signaling combined with 3-dimensional imaging of neuronal morphology, immunostaining, and behavior was used to disentangle the roles of nuclear calcium in NAc medium spiny neurons (MSNs) expressing the dopamine D<sub>1</sub> receptor (D1R) or D<sub>2</sub> receptor (D2R) on cocaine-evoked responses. The D1R-mediated potentiation of calcium influx through glutamate NMDA receptors, which shapes cocaine effects, also drives nuclear calcium transients. Fiber photometry revealed that cocaine-treated mice showed a sustained nuclear calcium increase in NAc D1R-MSNs. Disrupting nuclear calcium in D1R-MSNs, but not D2R-MSNs, blocked cocaine-evoked morphological changes of MSNs and gene expression and blunted cocaine's rewarding effects. Our study unravels the dynamics and roles of cocaine-induced nuclear calcium signaling increases in D1R-MSNs on molecular, cellular, and behavioral adaptations to cocaine and represents a significant breakthrough because it could contribute to the development of innovative strategies with therapeutic potential to alleviate addiction symptoms.",

We found that Arg levels in MDA-MB-231 cells decreased after depletion of extracellular Arg with a concomitant decline in cell viability.

However, the inherent features of protein clustering, especially for its reversible behavior and subtle microenvironment variation, present significant hurdles in probe chemistry for tracking protein clustering dynamics. Herein, we report a bilateral-tailored chemigenetic probe, in which an \"amphiphilic\" aggregate-induced emission luminogen (AIEgen) QMSO<sub>3</sub>Cl is covalently conjugated to a protein tag that is genetically fused to protein-of-interest (POI). Prior to target POI, the \"amphiphilic\" AIE-active QMSO<sub>3</sub>Cl achieves a completely dark state in both aqueous biological environment and lipophilic organelles, thereby ensuring an ultra-low intrinsic background interference. Upon reaching POI, the combination of synthetic molecule and genetically encoded protein allows for protein clustering-dependent ultra-sensitive response, with a substantial lighting-up fluorescence (67.5-fold) as protein transitions from disassembling to clustering state. Such ultra-high signal-to-noise ratio enables to monitor the dynamic and fate of inositol requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1) clustering/disassembling under both acute and chronic endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in living cells.

While this is a ubiquitous phenomenon in cell signaling, existing technologies cannot identify its kinetic complexity because specific subpopulations of binding events of different ligands are hidden in the averaging process in an ensemble. In addition, the limited time resolution of prevailing methods makes detecting and discriminating binding events among diverse interacting partners challenging. Here, we utilize a genetically encoded nanopore sensor to disentangle competitive protein-protein interactions (PPIs) in a one-on-one and label-free fashion. Our measurements involve binary mixtures of protein ligands of varying binding affinity against the same receptor, which was externally immobilized on the nanopore tip. We use the resistive-pulse technique to monitor the kinetics and dynamics of reversible PPIs without the nanopore confinement, with a high-time bandwidth, and at titratable ligand concentrations. In this way, we systematically evaluate how individual protein ligands take their turn to reside on the receptor's binding site. Further, our single-molecule determinations of these interactions are quantitatively compared with data generated by a two-ligand, one-receptor queuing model. The outcomes of this work provide a fundamental basis for future developments aimed at a better mechanistic understanding of competitive PPIs.

We used cardiac spheroids containing cardiomyocytes and fibroblasts differentiated from human induced pluripotent stem cells as model tissue. The spheroids were genetically encoded with an optogenetic actuator, CheRiff, and the calcium indicator jRCaMP1b. The Vm indicator was the organic dye RH237.

Fluorescence emission was split and imaged by two cameras (CaT: 595-665 nm; Vm: >700 nm). The spheroids were successfully stimulated optogenetically and Vm and CaT were recorded simultaneously without cross-talk using both excitation light bands. The 525-575 nm band produced higher signal-to-noise ratios than the 558-575 nm band, but caused a slight increase in tissue excitability because of CheRiff activation. The optogenetic actuator and CaT indicator are genetically encoded and can be expressed in engineered tissue constructs. In contrast, the Vm indicator is an organic dye that can stain any tissue.

Here we developed genetically encoded bioluminescent and fluorescent sensors to quantify subcellular NMN in live cells by engineering specific NMN-responsive protein scaffolds fused to luciferase and fluorescent proteins. The sensor dissected the multimechanistic uptake of exogenous NMN and nicotinamide riboside (NR) in live cells and further measured the NMN levels across different subcellular compartments, as well as the perturbed NMN/NAD<sup>+</sup> ratios by external supplements. Moreover, we measured the NMN regulation by NAD(H) hydrolase Nudts and peroxisomal carrier Pxmp2 and identified Slc25a45 as a potential mitochondrial NMN regulator for its unique fingerprint on the local NMN/NAD<sup>+</sup> ratio.

        "abstract": "Optical methods for studying the brain offer powerful approaches for understanding how neural activity underlies complex behavior. These methods typically rely on genetically encoded sensors and actuators to monitor and control neural activity. For microendoscopic calcium imaging, injection of a virus followed by implantation of a lens probe is required to express a calcium sensor and enable optical access to the target brain region. This two-step process poses several challenges, chief among them being the risks associated with mistargeting and/or misalignment between virus expression zone, lens probe and target brain region. Here, an adeno-associated virus (AAV)-eluting polymer coating is engineered for gradient refractive index (GRIN) lenses enabling the expression of a genetically encoded calcium indicator (GCaMP) directly within the brain region of interest upon implantation of the lens. This approach requires only one surgical step and guarantees alignment between GCaMP expression and lens in the brain. Additionally, the slow virus release from these coatings increases the working time for surgical implantation, expanding the brain regions and species amenable to this approach. These enhanced capabilities should accelerate neuroscience research utilizing optical methods and advance the understanding of the neural circuit mechanisms underlying brain function and behavior in health and disease.",

        "abstract": "Measuring ongoing cellular activity is essential to understanding the dynamic functions of biological organisms. The most popular current approach is imaging fluorescence-based genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicators (GECIs). While fluorescent probes are useful in many contexts, bioluminescence-based GECIs-probes that generate light through oxidation of a small-molecule by a luciferase or photoprotein-have several distinct advantages. Because bioluminescent (BL) GECIs do not use the bright extrinsic excitation light required for fluorescence, BL GECIs do not photobleach, do not suffer from nonspecific autofluorescent background, and do not cause phototoxicity. Further, BL GECIs can be applied in contexts where directly shining photons on an imaging target is not possible. Despite these advantages, the use of BL GECIs has to date been limited by their small changes in bioluminescence intensity, high baseline signal at resting Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations, and suboptimal Ca<sup>2+</sup> affinities. Here, we describe a new BL GECI, CaBLAM (Ca<sup>2+</sup> BioLuminescence Activity Monitor), that displays much higher dynamic range than previous BL GECIs and has a Ca<sup>2+</sup> affinity suitable for capturing physiological changes in cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration. With these improvements, CaBLAM captures single-cell and subcellular resolution activity at high frame rates in cultured neurons and <i>in vivo</i>, and allows multi-hour recordings in mice and behaving zebrafish. This new advance provides a robust alternative to traditional fluorescent GECIs that can enable or enhance imaging across many experimental conditions.",

        "abstract": "The calcium cation is a crucial signaling molecule involved in numerous cellular pathways. Beyond its role as a messenger or modulator in intracellular cascades, calcium's function in excitable cells, including nerve impulse transmission, is remarkable. The central role of calcium in nervous activity has driven the rapid development of fluorescent techniques for monitoring this cation in living cells. Specifically, genetically encoded calcium indicators (GECIs) are the most in-demand molecular tools in their class. In this work, we address two issues of calcium imaging by designing indicators based on the successful GCaMP6 backbone and the fluorescent protein BrUSLEE. The first indicator variant (GCaMP6s-BrUS), with a reduced, calcium-insensitive fluorescence lifetime, has potential in monitoring calcium dynamics with a high temporal resolution in combination with advanced microscopy techniques, such as light beads microscopy, where the fluorescence lifetime limits acquisition speed. Conversely, the second variant (GCaMP6s-BrUS-145), with a flexible, calcium-sensitive fluorescence lifetime, is relevant for static measurements, particularly for determining absolute calcium concentration values using fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM). To identify the structural determinants of calcium sensitivity in these indicator variants, we determine their spatial structures. A comparative structural analysis allowed the optimization of the GCaMP6s-BrUS construct, resulting in an indicator variant combining calcium-sensitive behavior in the time domain and enhanced molecular brightness. Our data may serve as a starting point for further engineering efforts towards improved GECI variants with fine-tuned fluorescence lifetimes.",

Disruption of subcellular calcium homeostasis and downstream stress pathways in the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria, including the unfolded protein response (UPR), have been implicated in the pathophysiology of noise-induced hearing loss. However, studies on the association between calcium homeostasis and stress pathways have been limited due to limited ability to measure calcium dynamics in mature-hearing, noise-exposed mice. We used a genetically encoded calcium indicator mouse model in which GCaMP6f is expressed specifically in hair cells or supporting cells under control of Myo15Cre or Sox2Cre, respectively. We performed live calcium imaging and UPR gene expression analysis in 8-week-old mice exposed to levels of noise that cause cochlear synaptopathy (98 db sound pressure level [SPL]) or permanent hearing loss (106 dB SPL). UPR activation occurred immediately after noise exposure, and the pattern of UPR activation was dependent on noise level, with the proapoptotic pathway upregulated only after 106 dB noise exposure. Spontaneous calcium transients in hair cells and intercellular calcium waves in supporting cells, which are present in neonatal cochleae, were quiescent in mature-hearing cochleae but reactivated upon noise exposure. Noise exposure of 106 dB was associated with more persistent and expansive intercellular Ca2+ signaling wave activity. These findings demonstrate a strong and dose-dependent association between noise exposure, UPR activation, and changes in calcium homeostasis in hair cells and supporting cells, suggesting that targeting these pathways may be effective to develop treatments for noise-induced hearing loss.",

The primary conformational descriptors for understanding IDP ensembles-the radius of gyration (<i>R</i><sub>G</sub>), measured by small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), and the root mean square (rms) end-to-end distance (<i>R</i><sub>E</sub>), probed by fluorescent resonance energy transfer (FRET)-are often reported to produce inconsistent results regarding IDP expansion as a function of denaturant concentration in the buffer. This ongoing debate surrounding the FRET-SAXS discrepancy raises questions about the overall reliability of either method for quantitatively studying IDP properties. To address this discrepancy, we introduce a genetically encoded anomalous SAXS (ASAXS) ruler, enabling simultaneous and direct measurements of <i>R</i><sub>G</sub> and <i>R</i><sub>E</sub> without assuming a specific structural model. This ruler utilizes a genetically encoded noncanonical amino acid with two bromine atoms, providing an anomalous X-ray scattering signal for precise distance measurements. Through this approach, we experimentally demonstrate that the ratio between <i>R</i><sub>E</sub> and <i>R</i><sub>G</sub> varies under different denaturing conditions, highlighting the intrinsic properties of IDPs as the primary source of the observed SAXS-FRET discrepancy rather than shortcomings in either of the two established methods.

In this study, we developed a genetically encoded nmTORC1 sensor, termed nTORSEL, based on the phosphorylation of the eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) binding protein 1 (4EBP1) by mTORC1 within the nucleus. nTORSEL, like its predecessor TORSEL, exhibits a fluorescent punctate pattern in the nucleus through multivalent protein-protein interactions between oligomerized 4EBP1 and eIF4E when nmTORC1 activity is low. We validated nTORSEL using biochemical analyses and imaging techniques across representative cell lines with varying levels of nmTORC1 activity. Notably, nTORSEL specifically detects physiological, pharmacological, and genetic inhibition of nmTORC1 in mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells but not in HEK293T cells.

Whilst dormant in humans, their divergent roles during transmission become apparent soon after mosquito feeding with a rapid transformation into gametes - males forming eight motile sperm-like cells aiming to fertilise a single female gamete. Little is known about how the parasite fuels this abrupt change, and the potential role played by their large and elaborate cristate mitochondrion. Using a sex-specific antibody and functional mitochondrial labelling, we show that the male gametocyte mitochondrion is less active than that of female gametocytes and more sensitive to antimalarials targeting mitochondrial energy metabolism. Rather than a vestigial organelle discarded during male gametogenesis, we demonstrate that mitochondrial ATP synthesis is essential for its completion. Additionally, using a genetically encoded ratiometric ATP sensor, we show that gametocytes can maintain cytoplasmic ATP homeostasis in the absence of mitochondrial respiration, indicating the essentiality of the gametocyte mitochondrion for transmission alone. Together, this reveals how gametocytes responsively balance the conflicting demands of a dormant and active lifestyle, highlighting the mitochondria as a rich source of transmission-blocking targets for future drug development.",

We address this gap in knowledge by designing two genetically encoded fluorescence pH sensors and a fluorescence lifetime imaging and analysis pipeline to monitor the pH of individual secretory ISGs within live cells at higher resolution and precision than previously possible. We observed different subpopulations of ISGs based on their pH and subcellular localization. Signals regulating metabolism vs membrane depolarization mobilize different subpopulations of ISGs for secretion, and we confirm that maturation signals acidify ISGs. We conclude that different signaling networks uniquely impact ISG mobilization and secretion.

In the interphase, pSer22 lamin A exists in low abundance and is involved in mechanotransduction, virus infection, and gene expression. Numerous evidences emerge to support lamin A regulation on cell function and fate by phosphorylation. However, live-cell imaging tools for visualizing the dynamics of pSer22 lamin A are yet to be established. Herein, we developed a novel lamin A phosphorylation sensor (LAPS) based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) with high sensitivity and specificity. We observed the dynamic lamin A phosphorylation during the cell cycle progression in single living cells: the increase of pSer22 modification when cells entered the mitosis and recovered upon the mitosis exit. Our biosensor also showed the gradual reduction of pSer22 modification during cell adhesion and in response to hypotonic environment. By applying LAPS, we captured the propagation of pSer22 modification from inside to outside of the inner nuclear membrane, which further led to the breakdown of nuclear envelope. Meanwhile, we found the synchronous phosphorylation of pSer22 lamin A and H3S10ph at mitosis entry. Inhibition of Aurora B, the responsible kinase for H3S10ph, could shorten the mitotic period without obvious effect on the pSer22 modification level of lamin A. Thus, LAPS allows the spatiotemporal visualization of the lamin A pSer22, which will be useful for elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying cell mitosis and mechanoresponsive processes.",

        "title": "Real-Time, Non-Invasive Monitoring of Neuronal Differentiation Using Intein-Enabled Fluorescence Signal Translocation in Genetically Encoded Stem Cell-Based Biosensors.",
        "abstract": "Real-time and non-invasive monitoring of neuronal differentiation will help increase our understanding of neuronal development and help develop regenerative stem cell therapies for neurodegenerative diseases. Traditionally, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), western blotting, and immunofluorescence (IF) staining have been widely used to investigate stem cell differentiation; however, their limitations include endpoint analysis, invasive nature of monitoring, and lack of single-cell-level resolution. Several limitations hamper current approaches to studying neural stem cell (NSC) differentiation. In particular, fixation and staining procedures can introduce artificial changes in cellular morphology, hindering our ability to accurately monitor the progression of the process and fully understand its functional aspects, particularly those related to cellular connectivity and neural network formation. Herein, we report a novel approach to monitor neuronal differentiation of NSCs non-invasively in real-time using cell-based biosensors (CBBs). Our research efforts focused on utilizing intein-mediated protein engineering to design and construct a highly sensitive biosensor capable of detecting a biomarker of neuronal differentiation, hippocalcin. Hippocalcin is a critical protein involved in neurogenesis, and the CBB functions by translocating a fluorescence signal to report the presence of hippocalcin externally. To construct the hippocalcin sensor proteins, hippocalcin bioreceptors, AP2 and glutamate ionotropic receptor AMPA-type subunit 2 (GRIA2), were fused to each split-intein carrying split-nuclear localization signal (NLS) peptides, respectively, and a fluorescent protein was introduced as a reporter. Protein splicing (PS) was triggered in the presence of hippocalcin to generate functional signal peptides, which promptly translocated the fluorescence signal to the nucleus. The stem cell-based biosensor showed fluorescence signal translocation only upon neuronal differentiation. Undifferentiated stem cells or cells that had differentiated into astrocytes or oligodendrocytes did not show fluorescence signal translocation. The number of differentiated neurons was consistent with that measured by conventional IF staining. Furthermore, this approach allowed for the monitoring of neuronal differentiation at an earlier stage than that detected using conventional approaches, and the translocation of fluorescence signal was monitored before the noticeable expression of class III β-tubulin (TuJ1), an early neuronal differentiation marker. We believe that these novel CBBs offer an alternative to current techniques by capturing the dynamics of differentiation progress at the single-cell level and by providing a tool to evaluate how NSCs efficiently differentiate into specific cell types, particularly neurons.",

        "abstract": "A remaining challenge for genetically encoded voltage indicators (GEVIs) is the reliable detection of excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs). Here, we developed ASAP5 as a GEVI with enhanced activation kinetics and responsivity near resting membrane potentials for improved detection of both spiking and subthreshold activity. ASAP5 reported action potentials (APs) in vivo with higher signal-to-noise ratios than previous GEVIs and successfully detected graded and subthreshold responses to sensory stimuli in single two-photon trials. In cultured rat or human neurons, somatic ASAP5 reported synaptic events propagating centripetally and could detect ∼1-mV EPSPs. By imaging spontaneous EPSPs throughout dendrites, we found that EPSP amplitudes decay exponentially during propagation and that amplitude at the initiation site generally increases with distance from the soma. These results extend the applications of voltage imaging to the quantal response domain, including in human neurons, opening up the possibility of high-throughput, high-content characterization of neuronal dysfunction in disease.",

        "abstract": "Pyruvate is central to metabolism across biology. It acts as a metabolic hub linking major pathways including glycolysis, the Krebs cycle, fermentation, and synthesis of amino acids, fatty acids, isoprenoids, and nucleotides. Even though the central role of pyruvate is well established biochemically, there is a remarkable gap in our understanding of how pyruvate levels behave within cells, where pyruvate is distributed across different compartments. Moreover, differential changes in pyruvate pools may occur rapidly upon changes in metabolic fluxes. Recently, this problem has been addressed by the development of a genetically encoded pyruvate biosensor to provide first insights into the pyruvate dynamics in animal cells. Here, we established in vivo biosensing of pyruvate in plants. We provided advanced characterization of the biosensor properties and demonstrated the functionality of the sensor in the cytosol, the mitochondria, and the chloroplasts of Nicotiana benthamiana epidermal cells. Finally, we harnessed the tool to investigate the impact of photosynthesis on pyruvate with unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution, revealing pronounced changes in subcellular pyruvate pools. While highlighting the current limitations of the biosensor, this study provides proof-of-concept for how the dynamics and regulation of central carbon metabolites can be revealed in living plant tissues.",

        "abstract": "Activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein (Arc) plays a crucial role in synaptic plasticity, a process integral to learning and memory. Arc transcription is induced within a few minutes of stimulation, making it a useful marker for neuronal activity. However, the specific neuronal activity patterns that initiate Arc transcription have remained elusive due to the inability to observe mRNA transcription in live cells in real time. Using a genetically encoded RNA indicator (GERI) mouse model that expresses endogenous Arc mRNA tagged with multiple GFPs, we investigated Arc transcriptional activity in response to various electrical field stimulation patterns. The GERI mouse model was generated by crossing the Arc-PBS knock-in mouse, engineered with binding sites in the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of Arc mRNA, and the transgenic mouse expressing the cognate binding protein fused to GFP. In dissociated hippocampal neurons, we found that the pattern of stimulation significantly affects Arc transcription. Specifically, theta-burst stimulation consisting of high-frequency (100 Hz) bursts delivered at 10 Hz frequency induced the highest rate of Arc transcription. Concurrently, the amplitudes of nuclear calcium transients also reached their peak with 10 Hz burst stimulation, indicating a correlation between calcium concentration and transcription. However, our dual-color single-cell imaging revealed that there were no significant differences in calcium amplitudes between Arc-positive and Arc-negative neurons upon 10 Hz burst stimulation, suggesting the involvement of other factors in the induction of Arc transcription. Our live-cell RNA imaging provides a deeper insight into the complex regulation of transcription by activity patterns and calcium signaling pathways.",

        "abstract": "The objective of our study was to develop a genetically encoded biosensor for quantification of Nedd8, a post-translational modifier that regulates cellular signals through conjugation to other proteins. Perturbations in the balance of free (i.e., unconjugated) and conjugated Nedd8 caused by defects in Nedd8 enzymes or cellular stress are implicated in various diseases. Despite the biological and biomedical importance of Nedd8 dynamics, no method exists for direct quantification of free Nedd8, hindering the study of Nedd8 and activities of its associated enzymes. Genetically encoded biosensors are established as tools to study other dynamic systems, but limitations of current biosensor design methods make them poorly suited for free Nedd8 quantification. We have developed a modular method to design genetically encoded biosensors that employs a target binding domain and two reporter domains positioned on opposite sides of the target binding site. Target quantification is based on competition between target binding and the interaction of the reporter domains. We applied our design strategy to free Nedd8 quantification by developing a selective binder for free Nedd8 and combining it with fluorescent or split nanoluciferase reporters. Our sensors produced quantifiable and specific signals for free Nedd8 and enabled real-time monitoring of deneddylation by DEN1 with a physiological substrate. Our sensor design will be useful for high-throughput screening for deneddylation inhibitors, which have potential in treatment of cancers such as acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The modular design strategy can be extended to develop genetically encoded quantitative biosensors for other proteins of interest.",

We sought to genetically encode mammalian transfection sensor (Trensor) circuits and test their utility in HeLa cells for detecting molecules and methods for their propensity to influence transfection. We intended these Trensor circuits to be triggered if their host cell was treated with polyplexed pDNA or certain small-molecule modulators of transfection. We prioritized three promoters, implicated by others in feedback responses as cells import and process foreign material and stably integrated each into the genomes of three different cell lines, each upstream of a green fluorescent protein (GFP) open reading frame within a transgene. All three Trensor circuits showed an increase in their GFP expression when their host HeLa cells were incubated with pDNA and the degraded polyamidoamine dendrimer reagent, SuperFect. We next experimentally demonstrated the modulation of PEI-mediated HeLa cell transient transfection by four different small molecules, with Trichostatin A (TSA) showing the greatest propensity to boost transgene expression. The Trensor circuit based on the <i>TRA2B</i> promoter (Trensor-T) was triggered by incubation with TSA alone and not the other three small molecules.

The sensors powered a high-throughput small molecule compound library screen, revealing multiple compounds in different chemical classes that strongly modulate cellular polyamine levels.

The hermaphroditic nematode Caenorhabditis elegans provides several unique advantages for the study of the OET as it is transparent and has an ordered gonad that produces one mature oocyte every ~23 min at 20 °C. We have modified the genetically encoded calcium indicator jGCaMP7s to fluorescently indicate the moment of fertilization within a living organism. We have termed this reporter \"CaFE\" for Calcium during Fertilization in C. elegans.

Here, a series of protocols is presented for utilizing the CaFE reporter as an in vivo tool for dissecting the OET and embryogenesis. We include methods to synchronize worms, examine the effects of RNAi knockdown, mount worms for imaging, and to visualize calcium in oocytes and embryos. Additionally, we present the generation of additional worm strains to aid in this type of analysis. Demonstrating the utility of the CaFE reporter to visualize the timing of fertilization, we report that double ovulation occurs when ipp-5 is targeted by RNAi and that only the first oocyte undergoes immediate fertilization. Furthermore, the discovery of single-cell calcium transients during early embryogenesis is reported here, demonstrating that the CaFE reporter persists into early development. Importantly, the CaFE reporter in worms is simple enough to use for incorporation into course-based undergraduate research (CURE) laboratory classes. The CaFE reporter, coupled with the ordered gonad and ease of RNAi in worms, facilitates inquiry into the cell-cell dynamics required to regulate internal fertilization and early embryogenesis.",

Here, we create a genetically encoded label-free sensor to identify the interaction between a motif of the MYC transcription factor, a primary cancer driver, and WDR5, a chromatin-associated protein hub. Using an engineered nanopore equipped with this motif, WDR5 is probed through reversible captures and releases in a one-by-one and time-resolved fashion. Our single-molecule kinetic measurements indicate a weak-affinity interaction arising from a relatively slow complex association and a fast dissociation of WDR5 from the tethered motif. Further, we validate this subtle interaction by determinations in an ensemble using single nanodisc-wrapped nanopores immobilized on a biolayer interferometry sensor. This study also provides the proof-of-concept for a sensor that reveals unique recognition signatures of different protein binding sites.

The donor and acceptor subunits associated and dissociated in response to temperature changes, altering the FRET efficiency. Consequently, gMELT functioned as a fluorescence ratiometric indicator. Untagged gMELT was expressed in the cytoplasm, whereas versions fused with specific localization signals were targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or mitochondria. All gMELT variations enabled more sensitive temperature measurements in cellular compartments than those in previous GETIs. The gMELTs, tagged with ER or mitochondrial targeting sequences, were used to detect thermogenesis in organelles stimulated chemically, a method previously known to induce thermogenesis. The observed temperature changes were comparable to previous reports, assuming that the fluorescence readout changes were exclusively due to temperature variations. Furthermore, we demonstrated how macromolecular crowding influences gMELT fluorescence given that this factor can subtly affect the fluorescence readout. Investigating thermogenesis with gMELT, accounting for factors such as macromolecular crowding, will enhance our understanding of intracellular thermogenesis phenomena.",

        "abstract": "During nutrient scarcity, plants can adapt their developmental strategy to maximize their chance of survival. Such plasticity in development is underpinned by hormonal regulation, which mediates the relationship between environmental cues and developmental outputs. In legumes, endosymbiosis with nitrogen-fixing bacteria (rhizobia) is a key adaptation for supplying the plant with nitrogen in the form of ammonium. Rhizobia are housed in lateral root-derived organs termed nodules that maintain an environment conducive to Nitrogenase in these bacteria. Several phytohormones are important for regulating the formation of nodules, with both positive and negative roles proposed for gibberellin (GA). In this study, we determine the cellular location and function of bioactive GA during nodule organogenesis using a genetically encoded second-generation GA biosensor, GIBBERELLIN PERCEPTION SENSOR 2 in Medicago truncatula. We find endogenous bioactive GA accumulates locally at the site of nodule primordia, increasing dramatically in the cortical cell layers, persisting through cell divisions, and maintaining accumulation in the mature nodule meristem. We show, through misexpression of GA-catabolic enzymes that suppress GA accumulation, that GA acts as a positive regulator of nodule growth and development. Furthermore, increasing or decreasing GA through perturbation of biosynthesis gene expression can increase or decrease the size of nodules, respectively. This is unique from lateral root formation, a developmental program that shares common organogenesis regulators. We link GA to a wider gene regulatory program by showing that nodule-identity genes induce and sustain GA accumulation necessary for proper nodule formation.",

Existing genetically encoded force sensors typically rely on fluorescence or bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (FRET or BRET) to visualize tension. However, these force sensing modules are relatively large, and interpreting measurements requires specialized image analysis and careful control experiments. Here, we report a compact molecular tension sensor that generates a bioluminescent signal in response to tension. This sensor (termed PILATeS) makes use of the split NanoLuc luciferase and consists of the <i>H. sapiens</i> titin I10 domain with the insertion of a 10-15 amino acid tag derived from the C-terminal β-strand of NanoLuc. Mechanical load across PILATeS mediates exposure of this tag to recruit the complementary split NanoLuc fragment, resulting in force-dependent bioluminescence. We demonstrate the ability of PILATeS to report biologically meaningful forces by visualizing forces at the interface between integrins and extracellular matrix substrates. We further use PILATeS as a genetically encoded sensor of tension experienced by the mechanosensing protein vinculin. We anticipate that PILATeS will provide an accessible means of visualizing molecular-scale forces in biological systems.",

Here, we developed a new genetically encoded fluorescent sensor, named PLpro-ERNuc, for detection of PLpro activity in living cells using a translocation-based readout. The sensor was designed as follows. A fragment of nsp3 protein was used to direct the sensor on the cytoplasmic surface of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, thus closely mimicking the natural target of PLpro. The fluorescent part included two bright fluorescent proteins-red mScarlet I and green mNeonGreen-separated by a linker with the PLpro cleavage site. A nuclear localization signal (NLS) was attached to ensure accumulation of mNeonGreen into the nucleus upon cleavage. We tested PLpro-ERNuc in a model of recombinant PLpro expressed in HeLa cells. The sensor demonstrated the expected cytoplasmic reticular network in the red and green channels in the absence of protease, and efficient translocation of the green signal into nuclei in the PLpro-expressing cells (14-fold increase in the nucleus/cytoplasm ratio). Then, we used PLpro-ERNuc in a model of Huh7.5 cells infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, where it showed robust ER-to-nucleus translocation of the green signal in the infected cells 24 h post infection. We believe that PLpro-ERNuc represents a useful tool for screening PLpro inhibitors as well as for monitoring virus spread in a culture.",

Herein, we introduce a multiplexed imaging strategy, 'sequential Fluorogenic RNA Imaging-Enabled Sensor' (seqFRIES), which enables live-cell target detection via sequential rounds of imaging-and-stripping. In seqFRIES, multiple orthogonal fluorogenic RNA aptamers are genetically encoded inside cells, and then the corresponding cell membrane permeable dye molecules are added, imaged, and rapidly removed in consecutive detection cycles. As a proof-of-concept, we have identified in this study four fluorogenic RNA aptamer/dye pairs that can be used for highly orthogonal and multiplexed imaging in living bacterial and mammalian cells. After further optimizing the cellular fluorescence activation and deactivation kinetics of these RNA/dye pairs, the whole four-color semi-quantitative seqFRIES process can be completed in ∼20 min. Meanwhile, seqFRIES-mediated simultaneous detection of critical signalling molecules and mRNA targets was also achieved within individual living cells. We expect our validation of this new seqFRIES concept here will facilitate the further development and potential broad usage of these orthogonal fluorogenic RNA/dye pairs for multiplexed and dynamic live-cell imaging and cell biology studies.",

Here we develop and characterize NOPLight, a genetically encoded sensor that sensitively reports changes in endogenous N/OFQ release. We characterized the affinity, pharmacological profile, spectral properties, kinetics, ligand selectivity, and potential interaction with intracellular signal transducers of NOPLight in vitro. Its functionality was established in acute brain slices by exogeneous N/OFQ application and chemogenetic induction of endogenous N/OFQ release from PNOC neurons. In vivo studies with fibre photometry enabled direct recording of NOPLight binding to exogenous N/OFQ receptor ligands, as well as detection of endogenous N/OFQ release within the paranigral ventral tegmental area (pnVTA) during natural behaviors and chemogenetic activation of PNOC neurons.

Using two-photon functional imaging, we mapped the spatial activation patterns representing a wide range of ecologically relevant odors across all six developmental stages. Our findings reveal a functionally ring-shaped organization of the antennal lobe composed of specific glomerular clusters. This configuration establishes an odor-specific chemotopic representation by encoding different chemical classes and ecologically distinct odors in the form of glomerular rings. The ring-shaped glomerular arrangement, which we confirm by selective targeting of OR70a-expressing sensory neurons, occurs throughout development, and the odor-coding pattern within the glomerular population is consistent across developmental stages.

Abnormalities in lysosomal function are closely linked to diseases, such as lysosomal storage disorders, neurodegeneration, intracellular infections, and cancer among others. Emerging body of research suggests the malfunction of lysosomal hydrolase trafficking pathway to be a common denominator of several disease pathologies. However, available conventional tools to assess lysosomal hydrolase trafficking are insufficient and fail to provide a comprehensive picture about the trafficking flux and location of lysosomal hydrolases. To address some of the shortcomings, we designed a genetically-encoded fluorescent reporter containing a lysosomal hydrolase tandemly tagged with pH sensitive and insensitive fluorescent proteins, which can spatiotemporally trace the trafficking of lysosomal hydrolases. As a proof of principle, we demonstrate that the reporter can detect perturbations in hydrolase trafficking, that are induced by pharmacological manipulations and pathophysiological conditions like intracellular protein aggregates. This reporter can effectively serve as a probe for mapping the mechanistic intricacies of hydrolase trafficking pathway in health and disease and is a utilitarian tool to identify genetic and pharmacological modulators of this pathway, with potential therapeutic implications.",

Here we investigate responses of PV interneurons in different layers of primary somatosensory barrel cortex (BC) to different excitatory inputs. With the genetically-encoded hybrid voltage sensor, hVOS, we recorded voltage changes in many L2/3 and L4 PV interneurons simultaneously, with stimulation applied to either L2/3 or L4. A semi-automated procedure was developed to identify small regions of interest corresponding to single responsive PV interneurons. Amplitude, half-width, and rise-time were greater for PV interneurons residing in L2/3 compared to L4. Stimulation in L2/3 elicited responses in both L2/3 and L4 with longer latency compared to stimulation in L4. These differences in latency between layers could influence their windows for temporal integration. Thus, PV interneurons in different cortical layers of BC respond in a layer specific and input specific manner, and these differences have potential roles in cortical computations.",

This OA release requires acetylcholine (ACh) released from Kenyon cells, signaling via nicotinic ACh receptors. Finally, we discovered that OA amplifies aversive learning behavior by augmenting dopamine-mediated punishment signals via Octβ1R in dopaminergic neurons, leading to alterations in synaptic plasticity within the MB.

Optimizing the linkers joining the two domains resulted in a ~fivefold to sixfold improvement in the dynamic range compared to the previous-generation sensor, with excellent discrimination against other analytes, and affinity variants varying from 4 µM to 500 µM. A chimeric version of this sensor fused to either the HaloTag protein or a suitable spectrally separated fluorescent protein provides an optional ratiometric readout allowing comparisons of ATP across cellular regions. Subcellular targeting the sensor to nerve terminals reveals previously uncharacterized single-synapse metabolic signatures, while targeting to the mitochondrial matrix allowed direct quantitative probing of oxidative phosphorylation dynamics.",

        "abstract": "Oligodendrocytes, the myelin-producing glial cells of the central nervous system (CNS), crucially contribute to myelination and circuit function. An increasing amount of evidence suggests that intracellular calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) dynamics in oligodendrocytes mediates activity-dependent and activity-independent myelination. Unraveling how myelinating oligodendrocytes orchestrate and integrate Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals, particularly in relation to axonal firing, is crucial for gaining insights into their role in the CNS development and function, both in health and disease. In this framework, we used the recombinant adeno-associated virus/Olig001 capsid variant to express the genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator jGCaMP8s, under the control of the myelin basic protein promoter. In our study, this tool exhibits excellent tropism and selectivity for myelinating and mature oligodendrocytes, and it allows monitoring Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity in myelin-forming cells, both in isolated primary cultures and organotypic spinal cord explants. By live imaging of myelin Ca<sup>2+</sup> events in oligodendrocytes within organ cultures, we observed a rapid decline in the amplitude and duration of Ca<sup>2+</sup> events across different in vitro developmental stages. Active myelin sheath remodeling and growth are modulated at the level of myelin-axon interface through Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling, and, during early myelination in organ cultures, this phase is finely tuned by the firing of axon action potentials. In the later stages of myelination, Ca<sup>2+</sup> events in mature oligodendrocytes no longer display such a modulation, underscoring the involvement of complex Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in CNS myelination.",

However, there is currently a shortage of such probes designed for ultrasensitive detection of Pb<sup>2+</sup>, and no reported probes exist for the quantitative detection of Pb<sup>2+</sup> in blood samples. This study aims to fill this critical void by developing and evaluating a novel fluorescent protein-based probe that promises accurate and rapid lead quantification in blood. A simple and small-molecule fluorescent protein-based probe was successfully constructed herein using a peptide PbrBD designed for Pb<sup>2+</sup> recognition coupled to a single fluorescent protein, sfGFP. The probe retains a three-coordinate configuration to identify Pb<sup>2+</sup> and has a high affinity for it with a K<sub>d</sub>' of 1.48 ± 0.05 × 10<sup>-17</sup> M. It effectively transfers the conformational changes of the peptide to the chromophore upon Pb<sup>2+</sup> binding, leading to fast fluorescence quenching and a sensitive response to Pb<sup>2+</sup>. The probe offers a broad dynamic response range of approximately 37-fold and a linear detection range from 0.25 nM to 3500 nM. More importantly, the probe can resist interference of metal ions in living organisms, enabling quantitative analysis of Pb<sup>2+</sup> in the picomolar to millimolar range in serum samples with a recovery percentage of 96.64%-108.74 %. This innovative probe, the first to employ a single fluorescent protein-based probe for ultrasensitive and precise analysis of Pb<sup>2+</sup> in animal and human serum, heralds a significant advancement in environmental monitoring and public health surveillance.

In this respect, Drosophila is an outstanding model for studying the impact of CO2 exposure on tissues. In this study we explored the response of intracellular pH (pHi) to a one-minute CO2 pulse using a genetically encoded, ubiquitously expressed pH sensor, tpHusion, to monitor pHi within a live, intact, whole fly. We compared wild-type flies to flies lacking Imaginal disc growth factors (Idgfs), which are chitinase-like proteins that facilitate developmental processes and the innate immune response. Morphogenetic and cytoskeletal defects in Idgf-null flies are enhanced after CO2 exposure. We found that pHi drops sharply within seconds of the beginning of a CO2 pulse and recovers over several minutes. The initial profile was nearly identical in control and Idgf-null flies but diverged as the pHi returned to normal. This study demonstrates the feasibility of monitoring pH in live adult Drosophila.

We introduce a novel small molecule fluorescent agent, termed <b>SERTlight</b>, that specifically labels serotonergic neuronal cell bodies, dendrites, and axonal projections as a serotonin transporter (SERT) fluorescent substrate. SERTlight was developed by an iterative molecular design process, based on an aminoethyl-quinolone system, to integrate structural elements that impart SERT substrate activity, sufficient fluorescent brightness, and a broad absence of pharmacological activity, including at serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5HT) receptors, other G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), ion channels, and monoamine transporters. The high labeling selectivity is not achieved by high affinity binding to SERT itself but rather by a sufficient rate of SERT-mediated transport of SERTlight, resulting in accumulation of these molecules in 5HT neurons and yielding a robust and selective optical signal in the mammalian brain. SERTlight provides a stable signal, as it is not released via exocytosis nor by reverse SERT transport induced by 5HT releasers such as MDMA. SERTlight is optically, pharmacologically, and operationally orthogonal to a wide range of genetically encoded sensors, enabling multiplexed imaging. SERTlight enables labeling of distal 5HT axonal projections and simultaneous imaging of the release of endogenous 5HT using the GRAB<sub>5HT</sub> sensor, providing a new versatile molecular tool for the study of the serotonergic system.",

In this study, the ultrabright, ultrasensitive, and calibratable genetically encoded voltage sensor rEstus is developed using structure-guided engineering. rEstus is most sensitive in the resting voltage range of non-excitable cells and offers a 3.6-fold improvement in brightness change for fast voltage spikes over its precursor ASAP3. Using rEstus, it is uncovered that the membrane voltage in several non-excitable cell lines (A375, HEK293T, MCF7) undergoes spontaneous endogenous alterations on a second to millisecond timescale. Correlation analysis of these optically recorded voltage alterations provides a direct, real-time readout of electrical cell-cell coupling, showing that visually connected A375 and HEK293T cells are also largely electrically connected, while MCF7 cells are only weakly coupled. The presented work provides enhanced tools and methods for non-invasive voltage imaging in living cells and demonstrates that spontaneous endogenous membrane voltage alterations are not limited to excitable cells but also occur in a variety of non-excitable cell types.",

        "abstract": "To monitor the Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics in cells, various genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicators (GECIs) based on Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) between fluorescent proteins are widely used for live imaging. Conventionally, cyan and yellow fluorescent proteins have been often used as FRET pairs. Meanwhile, bathochromically shifted indicators with green and red fluorescent protein pairs have various advantages, such as low toxicity and autofluorescence in cells. However, it remains difficult to develop them with a similar level of dynamic range as cyan and yellow fluorescent protein pairs. To improve this, we used Gamillus, which has a unique trans-configuration chromophore, as a green fluorescent protein. Based on one of the best high-dynamic-range GECIs, Twitch-NR, we developed a GECI with 1.5-times higher dynamic range (253%), Twitch-GmRR, using RRvT as a red fluorescent protein. Twitch-GmRR had high brightness and photostability and was successfully applied for imaging the Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics in live cells. Our results suggest that Gamillus with trans-type chromophores contributes to improving the dynamic range of GECIs. Therefore, selection of the cis-trans isomer of the chromophore may be a fundamental approach to improve the dynamic range of green-red FRET indicators, unlimited by GECIs.",

Calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) transients mediated signaling is known to be essential in cytokinesis across eukaryotic cells. However, the detailed spatiotemporal dynamics of Ca<sup>2+</sup> during plant cytokinesis remain largely unexplored. In this study, we employed GCaMP5, a genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor, to investigate cytokinetic Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients during cytokinesis in Nicotiana tabacum Bright Yellow-2 (BY-2) cells. We validated the effectiveness of GCaMP5 to capture fluctuations in intracellular free Ca<sup>2+</sup> in transgenic BY-2 cells. Our results reveal that Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics during BY-2 cell cytokinesis are distinctly different from those observed in embryonic and yeast cells. It is characterized by an initial significant Ca<sup>2+</sup> spike within the phragmoplast region. This spike is followed by a decrease in Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration at the onset of cytokinesis in phragmoplast, which then remains elevated in comparison to the cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> until the completion of cell plate formation. At the end of cytokinesis, Ca<sup>2+</sup> becomes uniformly distributed in the cytosol. This pattern contrasts with the typical dual waves of Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes observed during cytokinesis in animal embryonic cells and fission yeasts. Furthermore, applications of pharmaceutical inhibitors for either Ca<sup>2+</sup> or microtubules revealed a close correlation between Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients and microtubule organization in the regulation of cytokinesis.

Here we introduce LanTERN, a lanthanide-responsive fluorescent protein. LanTERN was designed based on GCaMP, a genetically encoded calcium indicator that couples the ion binding of four EF hand motifs to increased GFP fluorescence. We engineered eight mutations across the parent construct's four EF hand motifs to switch specificity from calcium to lanthanides.

We provide an overview of the mouse olfactory bulb (OB) and discuss recent studies using the GEVI ArcLight to study different cell types within the bulb using both widefield and two-photon microscopy. Specific emphasis is placed on using GEVIs to begin to study the principles of concentration coding in the OB, how to interpret the optical signals from population measurements in the <i>in vivo</i> brain, and future developments that will push the field forward.",

        "abstract": "The utility of genetically encoded biosensors for sensing the activity of signaling proteins has been hampered by a lack of strategies for matching sensor sensitivity to the physiological concentration range of the target. Here we used computational protein design to generate intracellular sensors of Ras activity (LOCKR-based Sensor for Ras activity (Ras-LOCKR-S)) and proximity labelers of the Ras signaling environment (LOCKR-based, Ras activity-dependent Proximity Labeler (Ras-LOCKR-PL)). These tools allow the detection of endogenous Ras activity and labeling of the surrounding environment at subcellular resolution. Using these sensors in human cancer cell lines, we identified Ras-interacting proteins in oncogenic EML4-Alk granules and found that Src-Associated in Mitosis 68-kDa (SAM68) protein specifically enhances Ras activity in the granules. The ability to subcellularly localize endogenous Ras activity should deepen our understanding of Ras function in health and disease and may suggest potential therapeutic strategies.",

        "abstract": "The voltage sensing domain (VSD) is a four-helix modular protein domain that converts electrical signals into conformational changes, leading to open pores and active enzymes. In most voltage sensing proteins, the VSDs do not interact with one another and the S1-S3 helices are considered mainly as scaffolding. The two exceptions are the voltage sensing phosphatase (VSP) and the proton channel (Hv). VSP is a voltage-regulated enzyme and Hvs are channels that only have VSDs. To investigate the S1 contribution to VSP function, we individually mutated four hydrophobic amino acids in S1 to alanine (F127, I131, I134 and L137). We also combined these mutations to generate quadruple mutation designated S1-Q. Most of these mutations shifted the voltage dependence of activity to higher voltages though interestingly, not all substrate reactions were the same. The kinetics of enzymatic activity were also altered with some mutations significantly slowing down dephosphorylation. The voltage dependence of VSD motions were consistently shifted to lower voltages and indicated a second voltage dependent motion. Co-immunoprecipitation demonstrated that none of the mutations broke the VSP dimer indicating that the S1 impact could stem from intrasubunit and/or intersubunit interactions. Lastly, when the same alanine mutations were introduced into a genetically encoded voltage indicator, they dramatically altered the optical readings, making some of the kinetics faster and shifting the voltage dependence. These results indicate that the S1 helix in VSP plays a critical role in tuning the enzymes conformational response to membrane potential transients and influencing the function of the VSD.",

However, recent findings of necroptosis, a programmed form of necrosis, shed a new light on necrosis. It has been challenging to detect necrosis reliably in vivo, partly due to the lack of genetically encoded sensors to detect necrosis. This is in stark contrast with the availability of many genetically encoded biosensors for apoptosis. Here we developed Necrosensor, a genetically encoded fluorescent sensor that detects necrosis in Drosophila, by utilizing HMGB1, which is released from the nucleus as a damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP). We demonstrate that Necrosensor is able to detect necrosis induced by various stresses in multiple tissues in both live and fixed conditions. Necrosensor also detects physiological necrosis that occurs during spermatogenesis in the testis. Using Necrosensor, we discovered previously unidentified, physiological necrosis of hemocyte progenitors in the hematopoietic lymph gland of developing larvae.

To develop intensiometric sensors with the capacity for ratiometric quantification, dual-FP Matryoshka sensors were generated by using a single cassette with a large Stokes shift (LSS) reference FP nested within the reporter FP (cpEGFP). Here, we present a genetically encoded calcium sensor that employs green apple (GA) Matryoshka technology by incorporating a newly designed red LSSmApple fluorophore. LSSmApple matures faster and provides an optimized excitation spectrum overlap with cpEGFP, allowing for monochromatic coexcitation with blue light. The LSS of LSSmApple results in improved emission spectrum separation from cpEGFP, thereby minimizing fluorophore bleed-through and facilitating imaging using standard dichroic and red FP (RFP) emission filters. We developed an image analysis pipeline for yeast (<i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>) timelapse imaging that utilizes LSSmApple to segment and track cells for high-throughput quantitative analysis.

However, the classical quorum sensing paradigm is that Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria generally communicate via homoserine lactones (HSLs) or oligopeptide molecular signals, respectively, to elicit population responses. Here, we create synthetic HSL sensors for Gram-positive <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> 168 using allosteric LuxR-type regulators (RpaR, LuxR, RhlR, and CinR) and synthetic promoters. Promoters were combinatorially designed from different sequence elements (-35, -16, -10, and transcriptional start regions). We quantified the effects of these combinatorial promoters on sensor activity and determined how regulator expression affects its activation, achieving up to 293-fold activation. Using the statistical design of experiments, we identified significant effects of promoter regions and pairwise interactions on sensor activity, which helped to understand the sequence-function relationships for synthetic promoter design. We present the first known set of functional HSL sensors (≥20-fold dynamic range) in <i>B. subtilis</i> for four different HSL chemical signals: <i>p</i>-coumaroyl-HSL, 3-oxohexanoyl-HSL, <i>n</i>-butyryl-HSL, and <i>n</i>-(3-hydroxytetradecanoyl)-HSL.

These methods typically rely on genetically encoded sensors and actuators to monitor and control neural activity. For microendoscopic calcium imaging, injection of a virus followed by implantation of a lens probe is required to express a calcium sensor and enable optical access to the target brain region. This two-step process poses several challenges, chief among them being the risks associated with mistargeting and/or misalignment between virus expression zone, lens probe and target brain region. Here, we engineer an adeno-associated virus (AAV)-eluting polymer coating for gradient refractive index (GRIN) lenses enabling expression of a genetically encoded calcium indicator (GCaMP) directly within the brain region of interest upon implantation of the lens. This approach requires only one surgical step and guarantees alignment between GCaMP expression and lens in the brain. Additionally, the slow virus release from these coatings increases the working time for surgical implantation, expanding the brain regions and species amenable to this approach. These enhanced capabilities should accelerate neuroscience research utilizing optical methods and advance our understanding of the neural circuit mechanisms underlying brain function and behavior in health and disease.",

In tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) pollen tubes, which naturally display coordinated spatial and temporal Ca2+ fluctuations, CPK21-FRET, but not CPK23-FRET, reported oscillatory emission ratio changes mirroring cytosolic Ca2+ changes, pointing to the isoform-specific Ca2+-sensitivity and reversibility of the conformational change. In Arabidopsis guard cells, CPK21-FRET-monitored conformational dynamics suggest that CPK21 serves as a decoder of signal-specific Ca2+ signatures in response to abscisic acid and the flagellin peptide flg22.

Here, the vast mutational landscape of proteins constitutes a significant obstacle that slows GEFI development, particularly for sensors that rely on mammalian host systems for testing. To overcome these obstacles, we developed a multiplexed high-throughput engineering platform called the optogenetic microwell array screening system (Opto-MASS) that functionally tests thousands of GEFI variants in parallel in mammalian cells. Opto-MASS represents the next step for engineering optogenetic tools as it can screen large variant libraries orders of magnitude faster than current methods. We showcase this system by testing over 13,000 dopamine and 21,000 opioid sensor variants. We generated a new dopamine sensor, dMASS<sup>1</sup>, with a >6-fold signal increase to 100 nM dopamine exposure compared to its parent construct. Our new opioid sensor, μMASS<sup>1</sup>, has a ∼4.6-fold signal increase over its parent scaffold's response to 500 nM DAMGO. Thus, Opto-MASS can rapidly engineer new sensors while significantly shortening the optimization time for new sensors with distinct biophysical properties.",

        "abstract": "Genetically encoded calcium ion (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) indicators (GECIs) are powerful tools for monitoring intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration changes in living cells and model organisms. In particular, GECIs have found particular utility for monitoring the transient increase of Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration that is associated with the neuronal action potential. However, the palette of highly optimized GECIs for imaging of neuronal activity remains relatively limited. Expanding the selection of available GECIs to include new colors and distinct photophysical properties could create new opportunities for <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> fluorescence imaging of neuronal activity. In particular, blue-shifted variants of GECIs are expected to have enhanced two-photon brightness, which would facilitate multiphoton microscopy. We describe the development and applications of T-GECO1 - a high-performance blue-shifted GECI based on the <i>Clavularia sp.</i>-derived mTFP1. We used protein engineering and extensive directed evolution to develop T-GECO1. We characterize the purified protein and assess its performance <i>in vitro</i> using one-photon excitation in cultured rat hippocampal neurons, <i>in vivo</i> using one-photon excitation fiber photometry in mice, and <i>ex vivo</i> using two-photon Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging in hippocampal slices. The Ca<sup>2+</sup>-bound state of T-GECO1 has an excitation peak maximum of 468 nm, an emission peak maximum of 500 nm, an extinction coefficient of 49,300 M<sup>-1</sup>cm<sup>-1</sup>, a quantum yield of 0.83, and two-photon brightness approximately double that of EGFP. The Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent fluorescence increase is 15-fold and the apparent <i>K</i><sub>d</sub> for Ca<sup>2+</sup> is 82 nM. With two-photon excitation conditions at 850 nm, T-GECO1 consistently enabled detection of action potentials with higher signal-to-noise (SNR) than a late generation GCaMP variant. T-GECO1 is a high performance blue-shifted GECI that, under two-photon excitation conditions, provides advantages relative to late generation GCaMP variants.",

        "abstract": "Acrosome exocytosis (AE), in which the sperm's single exocytotic vesicle fuses with the plasma membrane, is a complex, calcium-dependent process essential for fertilization. However, our understanding of how calcium signaling regulates AE is still incomplete. In particular, the interplay between intra-acrosomal calcium dynamics and the intermediate steps leading to AE is not well-defined. Here, we describe a method that provides spatial and temporal insights into acrosomal calcium dynamics and their relationship to membrane fusion and subsequent exocytosis of the acrosome vesicle. The method utilizes a novel transgenic mouse expressing an Acrosome-targeted Sensor for Exocytosis (AcroSensE). The sensor combines a genetically encoded calcium indicator (GCaMP) fused with mCherry. This fusion protein was specifically designed to enable the concurrent observation of acrosomal calcium dynamics and membrane fusion events. Real-time monitoring of acrosomal calcium dynamics and AE in live AcroSensE sperm is achieved using a combination of high frame-rate imaging and a stimulant delivery system that can target single sperm. This protocol also provides several examples of basic methods to quantify and analyze the raw data. Because the AcroSensE model is genetically encoded, its scientific significance can be augmented by using readily available genetic tools, such as crossbreeding with other mouse genetic models or gene-editing (CRISPR) based methods. With this strategy, the roles of additional signaling pathways in sperm capacitation and fertilization can be resolved. In summary, the method described here provides a convenient and effective tool to study calcium dynamics in a specific subcellular compartment-the sperm acrosome-and how those dynamics regulate the intermediate steps leading to membrane fusion and acrosome exocytosis.",

        "abstract": "Biochemical processes within the living cell occur in a highly crowded environment, where macromolecules, first of all proteins and nucleic acids, occupy up to 30% of the volume. The phenomenon of macromolecular crowding is not an exclusive feature of the cytoplasm and can be observed in the densely protein-packed, nonhomogeneous cellular membranes and at the membrane interfaces. Crowding affects diffusional and conformational dynamics of proteins within the lipid bilayer, alters kinetic and thermodynamic properties of biochemical reactions, and modulates the membrane organization. Despite its importance, the non-invasive quantification of the membrane crowding is not trivial. Here, we developed a genetically-encoded fluorescence-based sensor for probing the macromolecular crowding at the membrane interfaces. Two sensor variants, both composed of fluorescent proteins and a membrane anchor, but differing by flexible linker domains were characterized in vitro, and the procedures for the membrane reconstitution were established. Steric pressure induced by membrane-tethered synthetic and protein crowders altered the sensors' conformation, causing increase in the intramolecular Förster's resonance energy transfer. Notably, the effect of protein crowders only weakly correlated with their molecular weight, suggesting that other factors, such as shape and charge contribute to the crowding via the quinary interactions. Finally, measurements performed in inner membrane vesicles of Escherichia coli validated the crowding-dependent dynamics of the sensors in the physiologically relevant environment. The sensors offer broad opportunities to study interfacial crowding in a complex environment of native membranes, and thus add to the toolbox of methods for studying membrane dynamics and proteostasis.",

To test this, we first evaluated dLight photometry in mouse brain slices with simultaneous FSCV and found that both techniques yielded comparable results, but notable differences in responses to dopamine transporter inhibitors, including cocaine. We then used in vivo fiber photometry with dLight in mice to examine responses to cocaine in DLS. We also compared dopamine responses during Pavlovian conditioning across the striatum. We show that dopamine increases were readily detectable in DLS and describe transient dopamine kinetics, as well as slowly developing signals during conditioning.

GEFIs are complex proteins with multiple dynamic states, rendering optimization by trial-and-error mutagenesis a challenging problem. We applied an alternative approach using machine learning to predict the outcomes of sensor mutagenesis by analyzing established libraries that link sensor sequences to functions. Using the GCaMP calcium indicator as a scaffold, we developed an ensemble of three regression models trained on experimentally derived GCaMP mutation libraries. We used the trained ensemble to perform an in silico functional screen on 1423 novel, uncharacterized GCaMP variants. As a result, we identified the novel ensemble-derived GCaMP (eGCaMP) variants, eGCaMP and eGCaMP+, that achieve both faster kinetics and larger fluorescent responses upon stimulation than previously published fast variants. Furthermore, we identified a combinatorial mutation with extraordinary dynamic range, eGCaMP2+, that outperforms the tested 6th, 7th, and 8th generation GCaMPs. These findings demonstrate the value of machine learning as a tool to facilitate the efficient pre-screening of mutants for functional characteristics.

We termed this tool the 'CaFE' reporter, for 'calcium during fertilization in C. elegans'.

        "abstract": "Inadequate folic acid intake is linked to diseases such as megaloblastic anemia, neural tube defects, and hyperhomocysteinemia, increasing the risk of vascular disease and thrombosis. Folic acid, a cofactor in various enzymes, can be produced by plants and bacteria, but not by humans and other animals. L-5-methyl-tetrahydrofolate (L-5-methyl-THF) is the primary dietary folate form, transported in circulation for cellular metabolism. Traditional methods of determining folic acid levels are unreliable and time-consuming. SenFol (Sensor for folic acid) is a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based nanosensor that we have developed by inserting folic acid-binding protein (FolT) as the folate detecting domain between the pair of enhanced cyan fluorescent protein (ECFP) and Venus. The developed sensor is highly specific, produces a quick signal, which is pH stable, and delivers precise, ratiometric readings in cell-based experiments. The projected affinity score of folic acid with FolT was -7.4 kcal/mol. The apparent affinity (K<sub>d</sub>) of SenFol for folic acid is 28.49 × 10<sup>-9</sup> M, with a detection range of 5 × 10<sup>-9</sup> M to 5 × 10<sup>-7</sup> M, and a maximum FRET ratio change of 0.45. WT SenFol, a highly efficient folic acid nanosensor, can dynamically detect intracellular folic acid content in E. coli, yeast, and HEK-293 T cells, confirming its potential.",

        "title": "Detection of endogenous NPY release determined by novel GRAB sensor in cultured cortical neurons.",
        "abstract": "Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is an abundantly expressed peptide in the nervous system. Its widespread distribution along with its receptors, both centrally and peripherally, indicates its broad functions in numerous biological processes. However, the low endogenous concentration and diffuse distribution of NPY make it challenging to study its actions and dynamics directly and comprehensively. Studies on the role of NPY have primarily been limited to exogenous application, transgene expression, or knock-out in biological systems, which are often combined with pharmacological probes to delineate the involvement of specific NPY receptors. Therefore, to better understand the function of NPY in time and space, direct visualization of the real-time dynamics of endogenous NPY is a valuable and desired tool. Using the first-generation and newly developed intensiometric green fluorescent G-protein-coupled NPY sensor (GRAB NPY1.0), we, for the first time, demonstrate and characterize the direct detection of endogenously released NPY in cultured cortical neurons. A dose-dependent fluorescent signal was observed upon exogenous NPY application in nearly all recorded neurons. Pharmacologically evoked neuronal activity induced a significant increase in fluorescent signal in 32% of neurons, reflecting the release of NPY, despite only 3% of all neurons containing NPY. The remaining pool of neurons expressing the sensor were either non-responsive or displayed a notable decline in the fluorescent signal. Such decline in fluorescent signal was not rescued in cortical cultures transduced with an NPY overexpression vector, where 88% of the neurons were NPY-positive. Overexpression of NPY did, however, result in sensor signals that were more readily distinguishable. This may suggest that biological factors, such as subtle changes in intracellular pH, could interfere with the fluorescent signal, and thereby underestimate the release of endogenous NPY when using this new sensor in its present configuration. However, the development of next-generation NPY GRAB sensor technology is expected soon, and will eventually enable much-wanted studies on endogenous NPY release dynamics in both cultured and intact biological systems.",

        "title": "Genetically encoded phosphatidylserine biosensor for in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo labelling.",
        "abstract": "The dynamics of phosphatidylserine in the plasma membrane is a tightly regulated feature of eukaryotic cells. Phosphatidylserine (PS) is found preferentially in the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane. Disruption of this asymmetry leads to the exposure of phosphatidylserine on the cell surface and is associated with cell death, synaptic pruning, blood clotting and other cellular processes. Due to the role of phosphatidylserine in widespread cellular functions, an efficient phosphatidylserine probe is needed to study them. Currently, a few different phosphatidylserine labelling tools are available; however, these labels have unfavourable signal-to-noise ratios and are difficult to use in tissues due to limited permeability. Their application in living tissue requires injection procedures that damage the tissue and release damage-associated molecular patterns, which in turn stimulates phosphatidylserine exposure. For this reason, we developed a novel genetically encoded phosphatidylserine probe based on the C2 domain of the lactadherin (MFG-E8) protein, suitable for labelling exposed phosphatidylserine in various research models. We tested the C2 probe specificity to phosphatidylserine on hybrid bilayer lipid membranes by observing surface plasmon resonance angle shift. Then, we analysed purified fused C2 proteins on different cell culture lines or engineered AAVs encoding C2 probes on tissue cultures after apoptosis induction. For in vivo experiments, neurotropic AAVs were intravenously injected into perinatal mice, and after 2 weeks, brain slices were collected to observe C2-SNAP expression. The biophysical analysis revealed the high specificity of the C2 probe for phosphatidylserine. The fused recombinant C2 proteins were suitable for labelling phosphatidylserine on the surface of apoptotic cells in various cell lines. We engineered AAVs and validated them in organotypic brain tissue cultures for non-invasive delivery of the genetically encoded C2 probe and showed that these probes were expressed in the brain in vivo after intravenous AAV delivery to mice. We have demonstrated that the developed genetically encoded PS biosensor can be utilised in a variety of assays as a two-component system of C2 and C2m2 fusion proteins. This system allows for precise quantification and PS visualisation at directly specified threshold levels, enabling the evaluation of PS exposure in both physiological and cell death processes.",

With Pepper, we engineered various sensors for metabolites, synthetic compounds, proteins and metal ions in vitro and in living cells. In addition, these sensors show high activation and selectivity, demonstrating their universality and robustness. In the case of sensors responding to S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), a metabolite produced by methionine adenosyltransferase (MATase), we showed that our sensors exhibited positively correlated fluorescence responding to different SAM levels. Importantly, we revealed the SAM biosynthesis pathway and monitored MATase activity and gene expression spatiotemporally in living individual human cells. Additionally, we constructed a ratiometric SAM sensor to determine the inhibition efficacy of a MATase inhibitor in living cells. Together, these sensors comprising Pepper provide a useful platform for imaging diverse cellular targets and their signaling pathway.",

However, one- and two-photon voltage imaging over prolonged periods with the same GEVI has not yet been demonstrated. Here, we report engineering of ASAP family GEVIs to enhance photostability by inversion of the fluorescence-voltage relationship. Two of the resulting GEVIs, ASAP4b and ASAP4e, respond to 100-mV depolarizations with ≥180% fluorescence increases, compared with the 50% fluorescence decrease of the parental ASAP3. With standard microscopy equipment, ASAP4e enables single-trial detection of spikes in mice over the course of minutes. Unlike GEVIs previously used for one-photon voltage recordings, ASAP4b and ASAP4e also perform well under two-photon illumination. By imaging voltage and calcium simultaneously, we show that ASAP4b and ASAP4e can identify place cells and detect voltage spikes with better temporal resolution than commonly used calcium indicators. Thus, ASAP4b and ASAP4e extend the capabilities of voltage imaging to standard one- and two-photon microscopes while improving the duration of voltage recordings.",

In addition, picosecond dynamics of intermolecular energy transfer in fluorescent proteins has been observed. Here, we present the development of a genetically encoded fluorescent sensor that can detect changes in hydrophobicity by monitoring ultrafast fluorescence depolarisation. Our sensor is composed of a pair of dimeric enhanced green fluorescent proteins (dEGFPs) linked by a flexible amino-acid linker. We show dimerisation is perturbed by the addition of glycerol which interferes with the hydrophobic interaction of the two proteins. Time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy revealed a systematic attenuation of ultrafast fluorescence depolarisation when the sensor was exposed to increasing glycerol concentrations. This suggests that as hydrophobicity increases, dEGFP pairing decreases within a tandem dimer. Un-pairing of the protein fluorophores dramatically alters the rate of energy transfer between the proteins, resulting in an increase in the limiting anisotropy of the sensor.",

Our work reveals temporal dynamics of FAK activity during FA turnover. Most importantly, our study unveils polarized FAK activity at the distal tip of newly formed single FAs in the leading edge of a migrating cell. By combining FAK-SPARK with DNA tension probes, we show that tensions applied to FAs precede FAK activation and that FAK activity is proportional to the strength of tension. These results suggest tension-induced polarized FAK activity in single FAs, advancing the mechanistic understanding of cell migration.",

Despite its importance, the neuromodulatory transmission in most tissues and organs remains poorly understood due to the limitations of current tools for direct measurement of neuromodulatory transmitters. In order to study the functional roles of neuromodulatory transmitters in animal behaviors and brain disorders, new fluorescent sensors based on bacterial periplasmic binding proteins (PBPs) and G-protein coupled receptors have been developed, but their results have not been compared to or multiplexed with traditional methods such as electrophysiological recordings. In this study, a multiplexed method was developed to measure acetylcholine (ACh), norepinephrine (NE), and serotonin (5-HT) in cultured rat hippocampal slices using simultaneous whole-cell patch clamp recordings and genetically encoded fluorescence sensor imaging. The strengths and weaknesses of each technique were compared, and the results showed that both techniques did not interfere with each other. In general, genetically encoded sensors GRAB<sub><i>NE</i></sub> and GRAB<sub>5<i>HT</i>1</sub>.<sub>0</sub> showed better stability compared to electrophysiological recordings in detecting NE and 5-HT, while electrophysiological recordings had faster temporal kinetics in reporting ACh.

Despite substantial advances in the field of neurotoxicology, there remain significant knowledge gaps in our understanding of cellular targets and molecular mechanisms that mediate the neurotoxicological endpoints associated with exposure to both legacy contaminants and emerging contaminants of concern. Zebrafish are a powerful neurotoxicological model given their high degree sequence conservation with humans and the similarities they share with mammals in micro- and macro-level brain structures. Many zebrafish studies have effectively utilized behavioral assays to predict the neurotoxic potential of different compounds, but behavioral phenotypes are rarely able to predict the brain structures, cell types, or mechanisms affected by chemical exposures. Calcium-modulated photoactivatable ratiometric integrator (CaMPARI), a recently developed genetically-encoded calcium indicator, undergoes a permanent green to red switch in the presence of elevated intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations and 405-nm light, which allows for a \"snapshot\" of brain activity in freely-swimming larvae. To determine whether behavioral results are predictive of patterns of neuronal activity, we assessed the effects of three common neurotoxicants, ethanol, 2,2',3,5',6-pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB 95), and monoethylhexyl phthalate (MEHP), on both brain activity and behavior by combining the behavioral light/dark assay with CaMPARI imaging. We demonstrate that brain activity profiles and behavioral phenotypes are not always concordant and, therefore, behavior alone is not sufficient to understand how toxicant exposure affects neural development and network dynamics. We conclude that pairing behavioral assays with functional neuroimaging tools such as CaMPARI provides a more comprehensive understanding of the neurotoxic endpoints of compounds while still offering a relatively high throughput approach to toxicity testing.",

However, the unfavorable characteristics of FR impede sensor applications. Here, we describe a strategy for converting Pepper fluorescent RNA into a series of fluorescent sensors to detect their cognate targets both in vitro and in live cells. Compared to previously developed FR-based sensors, Pepper-based sensors exhibited expanded emission of up to 620 nm and markedly improved cellular brightness, allowing robust and real-time monitoring of the pharmacologic-triggered dynamics changes in the intracellular level of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) and the optogenetic manipulated protein translocation in live mammalian cells. Furthermore, signal amplification in fluorescence imaging of the target was achieved using the CRISPR-display strategy by incorporating a Pepper-based sensor into the sgRNA scaffold. Together, these results demonstrate that Pepper can be readily developed into high-performance FR-based sensors to detect various cellular targets.",

        "abstract": "A variety of protein tags are available for genetically encoded protein labeling, which allow their precise localization and tracking inside the cells. A new dimension in protein imaging can be offered by combining protein tags with polarity-sensitive fluorescent probes, which provide information about local nanoscale environments of target proteins within the subcellular compartments (organelles). Here, we designed three fluorescent probes based on solvatochromic nile red dye, conjugated to a HaloTag reactive targeting group through polyethylene glycol linkers of varying lengths. The probe with medium linker length, NR12-Halo, was found to label specifically a large variety of proteins localized in defined cell compartments, such as plasma membranes (outer and inner leaflets), endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, cytosol, microtubules, actin, and chromatin. Owing to its polarity-sensitive fluorophore, the probe clearly distinguished the proteins localized within apolar lipid membranes from other proteins. Moreover, it revealed dramatic changes in the environment during the life cycle of proteins from biosynthesis to their expected localization and, finally, to recycling inside lysosomes. Heterogeneity in the local polarity of some membrane proteins also suggested a formation of low-polar protein aggregates, for example, within cell-cell contacts. The approach also showed that mechanical stress (cell shrinking by osmotic shock) induced a general polarity decrease in membrane proteins, probably due to the condensation of biomolecules. Finally, the nanoenvironment of some membrane proteins was affected by a polyunsaturated fatty acid diet, which provided the bridge between organization of lipids and proteins. The developed solvatochromic HaloTag probe constitutes a promising tool for probing nanoscale environments of proteins and their interactions within subcellular structures.",

However, due to the spectral overlap of common fluorophores, multiplexed fluorescence imaging beyond two-to-three targets inside living cells remains a technical challenge. Herein, we introduce a multiplexed imaging strategy that enables live-cell target detection via sequential rounds of imaging-and-stripping process, which is named as \"sequential Fluorogenic RNA Imaging-Enabled Sensor\" (seqFRIES). In seqFRIES, multiple orthogonal fluorogenic RNA aptamers are genetically encoded inside cells, and then the corresponding cell membrane permeable dye molecules are added, imaged, and rapidly removed in consecutive detection cycles. As a proof-of-concept, we have identified in this study five <i>in vitro</i> orthogonal fluorogenic RNA aptamer/dye pairs (>10-fold higher fluorescence signals), four of which can be used for highly orthogonal and multiplexed imaging in living bacterial and mammalian cells. After further optimizing the cellular fluorescence activation and deactivation kinetics of these RNA/dye pairs, the whole four-color semi-quantitative seqFRIES process can now be completed in ~20 min. Meanwhile, seqFRIES-mediated simultaneous detection of two critical signaling molecules, guanosine tetraphosphate and cyclic diguanylate, was also achieved within individual living cells.

H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> can diffuse across membranes, has a low reactivity, and is very stable. Deprotonated cysteine residues in proteins can be oxidized by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> into a highly reactive sulfenic acid derivative (-SOH), which can react with another cysteine to form a disulfide. Under higher oxidative stress the sulfenic acid undergo further oxidation to sulfinic acid (Cys-SO<sub>2</sub>H), which can subsequently be reduced. The sulfinic acid can be hyperoxidized to sulfonic acid (Cys-SO<sub>3</sub>H), whose reduction is irreversible. Formation of sulfenic acids can have a role in sensing oxidative stress, signal transduction, modulating localization and activity to regulate protein functions. Therefore, there is an emerging interest in trying to understand the pool of proteins that result in these sorts of modification in response to oxidative stress. This is known as the sulfenome and several approaches have been developed in animal and plant cells to analyze the sulfenome under different stress responses. These approaches can be proteomic, molecular, immunological (i.e., antibodies), or expressing genetically encoded probes that specifically react to sulfenic modifications. In this chapter, we describe an additional approach that allows visualization of sulfenic modification in vivo.

Under pathophysiological conditions, disturbances in these pools have been linked to altered intracellular communication and cellular dysfunction. To facilitate studies of subcellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in beta cells and, particularly, signaling between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria, we designed a novel dual Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor which we termed DS-1. DS-1 encodes two stoichiometrically fluorescent proteins within a single plasmid, G-CEPIA-er, targeted to the ER and R-CEPIA3-mt, targeted to mitochondria. Our goal was to simultaneously measure the ER and mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> in cells in real time. The <i>K<sub>ds</sub></i> of G-CEPIA-er and R-CEPIA3-mt for Ca<sup>2+</sup> are 672 and 3.7 μM, respectively. Confocal imaging of insulin-secreting INS-1 832/13 expressing DS-1 confirmed that the green and red fluorophores correctly colocalized with organelle-specific fluorescent markers as predicted. Further, we tested whether DS-1 exhibited the functional properties expected by challenging an INS-1 cell to glucose concentrations or drugs having well-documented effects on the ER and mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling. The data obtained were consistent with those seen using other single organelle targeted probes. These results taken together suggest that DS-1 is a promising new approach for investigating Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling within multiple organelles of the cell.",

Still, the exact mechanism governing magnesium transport by this protein complex is not well understood. Herein, we have developed a genetically encoded intracellular magnesium-specific reporter and demonstrate that the CNNM family inhibits the function of the TRPM7 magnesium channel. We show that the small GTPase ARL15 increases CNNM3/TRPM7 protein complex formation to reduce TRPM7 activity. Conversely, PRL-2 overexpression counteracts ARL15 binding to CNNM3 and enhances the function of TRPM7 by preventing the interaction between CNNM3 and TRPM7. Moreover, while TRPM7-induced cell signaling is promoted by PRL-1/2, it is reduced when CNNM3 is overexpressed. Lowering cellular magnesium levels reduces the interaction of CNNM3 with TRPM7 in a PRL-dependent manner, whereby knockdown of PRL-1/2 restores the protein complex formation. Cotargeting of TRPM7 and PRL-1/2 alters mitochondrial function and sensitizes cells to metabolic stress induced by magnesium depletion. These findings reveal the dynamic regulation of TRPM7 function in response to PRL-1/2 levels, to coordinate magnesium transport and reprogram cellular metabolism.",

Exosomes originating from cancer cells have promising biomarkers for the early detection and assessment of the therapeutic response to cancer. The exosomal epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a potential biomarker which is overexpressed in cancer; thus, the level of EGFR expression is investigated by so many methods in a liquid and solid biopsy. The optimal method for isolating pure exosomal EGFRs has not been well understood so far. Current approaches are complicated and time-consuming, therefore hampering their clinical applications. Here, we demonstrate the creation of an innovative fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) sensor, named ExoSen (exosome sensor), which can be implemented to determine the concentration of exosomal EGFRs at in vitro as well as in vivo levels. In this study, a sensing element for A549 exosomes, mitogen-inducible gene 6 (MIG6), has been employed between the FRET pair ECFP and Venus. MIG6 binding to ExoSen induced a conformational change that can be monitored by a variation in the FRET ratio. Moreover, the developed sensor, expressed in bacterial, yeast, and HEK-293T cells, demonstrates an increased FRET ratio with the addition of A549 exosomes, which can quantify the A549 exosomes noninvasively. The ExoSen enables rapid detection of A549 exosomes with great sensitivity at a concentration of 3.5 × 10<sup>9</sup> particles/mL.

The genetic encodability permitted a straightforward protein engineering process to derive a red fluorescent biosensor that can specifically bind uridine diphosphate N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc), an important nucleotide sugar involved in metabolic sensing and cell signaling. We further characterized the resultant boronic acid-and peptide-assisted UDP-GlcNAc sensor (bapaUGAc) both in vitro and in live mammalian cells. Because UDP-GlcNAc in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus plays essential roles in glycosylating biomolecules in the secretory pathway, we genetically expressed bapaUGAc in the ER and Golgi and validated the sensor for its responses to metabolic disruption and pharmacological inhibition. In addition, we combined bapaUGAc with UGAcS, a recently reported green fluorescent UDP-GlcNAc sensor based on an alternative sensing mechanism, to monitor UDP-GlcNAc level changes in the ER and cytosol simultaneously. We expect our work to facilitate the future development of specific boronolectins for carbohydrates. In addition, this newly developed genetically encoded bapaUGAc sensor will be a valuable tool for studying UDP-GlcNAc and glycobiology.",

        "abstract": "Adenosine 5' triphosphate (ATP) is the energy currency of life, which is produced in mitochondria (~90%) and cytosol (less than 10%). Real-time effects of metabolic changes on cellular ATP dynamics remain indeterminate. Here we report the design and validation of a genetically encoded fluorescent ATP indicator that allows for real-time, simultaneous visualization of cytosolic and mitochondrial ATP in cultured cells. This dual-ATP indicator, called smacATPi (simultaneous mitochondrial and cytosolic ATP indicator), combines previously described individual cytosolic and mitochondrial ATP indicators. The use of smacATPi can help answer biological questions regarding ATP contents and dynamics in living cells. As expected, 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG, a glycolytic inhibitor) led to substantially decreased cytosolic ATP, and oligomycin (a complex V inhibitor) markedly decreased mitochondrial ATP in cultured HEK293T cells transfected with smacATPi. With the use of smacATPi, we can also observe that 2-DG treatment modestly attenuates mitochondrial ATP and oligomycin reduces cytosolic ATP, indicating the subsequent changes of compartmental ATP. To evaluate the role of ATP/ADP carrier (AAC) in ATP trafficking, we treated HEK293T cells with an AAC inhibitor, Atractyloside (ATR). ATR treatment attenuated cytosolic and mitochondrial ATP in normoxia, suggesting AAC inhibition reduces ADP import from the cytosol to mitochondria and ATP export from mitochondria to cytosol. In HEK293T cells subjected to hypoxia, ATR treatment increased mitochondrial ATP along with decreased cytosolic ATP, implicating that ACC inhibition during hypoxia sustains mitochondrial ATP but may not inhibit the reversed ATP import from the cytosol. Furthermore, both mitochondrial and cytosolic signals decrease when ATR is given in conjunction with 2-DG in hypoxia. Thus, real-time visualization of spatiotemporal ATP dynamics using smacATPi provides novel insights into how cytosolic and mitochondrial ATP signals respond to metabolic changes, providing a better understanding of cellular metabolism in health and disease.",

Here, we developed the first pan-neuronal genetic driver in a Hymenopteran model organism, the honey bee, and expressed the calcium indicator GCaMP6f under the control of the honey bee synapsin promoter. We show that GCaMP6f is widely expressed in the honey bee brain, allowing to record neural activity from multiple brain regions. To assess the power of this tool, we focused on the olfactory system, recording simultaneous responses from the antennal lobe, and from the more poorly investigated lateral horn (LH) and mushroom body (MB) calyces. Neural responses to 16 distinct odorants demonstrate that odorant quality (chemical structure) and quantity are faithfully encoded in the honey bee antennal lobe. In contrast, odor coding in the LH departs from this simple physico-chemical coding, supporting the role of this structure in coding the biological value of odorants. We further demonstrate robust neural responses to several bee pheromone odorants, key drivers of social behavior, in the LH. Combined, these brain recordings represent the first use of a neurogenetic tool for recording large-scale neural activity in a eusocial insect and will be of utility in assessing the neural underpinnings of olfactory and other sensory modalities and of social behaviors and cognitive abilities.",

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a highly aggressive hematopoietic malignancy characterized by aberrant levels of reduced and oxidized GSH due to oxidative stress. Therefore, the real-time, dynamic, and highly sensitive detection of GSH/GSSG in AML cells is of great interest for the clinical diagnosis and treatment of leukemia. The application of genetically encoded sensors to monitor GSH/GSSG levels in AML cells is not explored, and the underlying mechanism of how the drugs affect GSH/GSSG dynamics remains unclear. In this study, we developed subcellular compartment-specific sensors to monitor GSH/GSSG combined with high-resolution fluorescence microscopy that provides insights into basal GSH/GSSG levels in the cytosol, mitochondria, nucleus, and endoplasmic reticulum of AML cells, in a decreasing order, revealing substantial heterogeneity of GSH/GSSG level dynamics in different subcellular compartments. Further, we investigated the response of GSH/GSSG ratio in AML cells caused by Prussian blue and Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> nanoparticles, separately and in combination with cytarabine, pointing to steep gradients. Moreover, cytarabine and doxorubicin downregulated the GSH/GSSG levels in different subcellular compartments. Similarly, live-cell imaging showed a compartment-specific decrease in response to various drugs, such as CB-839, parthenolide (PTL), and piperlongumine (PLM). The enzymatic activity assay revealed the mechanism underlying fluctuations in GSH/GSSG levels in different subcellular compartments mediated by these drugs in the GSH metabolic pathway, suggesting some potential therapeutic targets in AML cells.",

A bottleneck, however, exists in observing calcium dynamics in a noninvasive manner because of the optical inaccessibility of the mammalian liver. Here, we aimed to take advantage of the transparency of the zebrafish larvae to image hepatocyte calcium dynamics in vivo at cellular resolution. We developed a transgenic model expressing a calcium sensor, GCaMP6s, specifically in zebrafish hepatocytes. Using this, we provide a quantitative assessment of intracellular calcium dynamics during multiple contexts, including growth, feeding, ethanol-induced stress, and cell ablation. Specifically, we show that synchronized calcium oscillations are present in vivo , which are lost upon starvation. Starvation induces lipid accumulation in the liver. Feeding recommences calcium waves in the liver, but in a spatially restricted manner, as well as resolves starvation-induced hepatic steatosis. By using a genetically encoded scavenger for calcium, we show that dampening of calcium signaling accelerates the accumulation of starvation-related lipid droplets in the liver. Furthermore, ethanol treatment, as well as cell ablation, induces calcium flux, but with different dynamics. The former causes asynchronous calcium oscillations, whereas the latter leads to a single calcium spike. We demonstrate the presence of oscillations, waves, and spikes in vivo .

This unique property was previously used to label neurons based upon their tuning properties in order to map synaptic connectivity and to record large-scale neuronal activity in freely moving mice without attaching any mechanical device to them. The latest version of CaMPARI (CaMPARI2) was engineered to enhance the contrast generated by photoconverting the green protein to the activity-dependent red form and to reduce the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent photoconversion rate compared to the first generation of CaMPARI (CaMPARI1). However, here we show that this optimization process also resulted in reduced photoconversion efficiency of active neurons in the mouse cortex and hippocampus. Through side-by-side comparison of the two CaMPARI sensors under several experimental conditions, we show that CaMPARI1 exhibits a substantially higher red-to-green ratio in active cells than CaMPARI2. In addition, we show that CaMPARI1 also functions as a more sensitive traditional Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor than CaMPARI2 by producing larger activity-driven dynamic fluorescence changes in the observed neurons. Therefore, we conclude that during the optimization process of CaMPARI2, some of the sensor's characteristics were not predicted properly by <i>in vitro</i> screening assays, and therefore <i>in vivo</i> screening and validation steps should be included in future optimization attempts to increase the predictability of screening pipelines.",

This indicator exhibits a maximal fluorescence change of 200% and a <i>K</i><sub>D</sub> of ∼300 μM. The fluorescence is not affected by other monocarboxylates. The lactate indicator was not significantly affected by Ca<sup>2+</sup> at the physiological concentrations prevailing in the cytosol, endoplasmic reticulum, and extracellular space, but was affected by Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the low micromolar range. Targeting the indicator to the endoplasmic reticulum revealed for the first time sub-cellular lactate dynamics. Its improved lactate-induced fluorescence response permitted the development of a multiwell plate assay to screen for inhibitors of the monocarboxylate transporters MCTs, a pharmaceutical target for cancer and inflammation. The functionality of the indicator in living tissue was demonstrated in the brain of <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> larvae. CanlonicSF is well suited to explore lactate dynamics with sub-cellular resolution in intact systems.",

Here, we screen existing genetically encoded cAMP sensors and further develop the best performer to derive three improved variants, called cAMPFIREs. Compared with their parental sensor, these sensors exhibit up to 10-fold increased sensitivity to cAMP and a cytosolic distribution. cAMPFIREs are compatible with both ratiometric and fluorescence lifetime imaging and can detect cAMP dynamics elicited by norepinephrine at physiologically relevant, nanomolar concentrations. Imaging of cAMPFIREs in awake mice reveals tonic levels of cAMP in cortical neurons that are associated with wakefulness, modulated by opioids, and differentially regulated across subcellular compartments. Furthermore, enforced locomotion elicits neuron-specific, bidirectional cAMP dynamics. cAMPFIREs also function in Drosophila.

        "abstract": "Flavin-based fluorescent proteins (FbFPs) are a class of fluorescent reporters that undergo oxygen-independent fluorophore incorporation, which is an important advantage over green fluorescent proteins (GFPs) and mFruits. A FbFP derived from <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> (CreiLOV) is a promising platform for designing new metal sensors. Some FbFPs are intrinsically quenched by metal ions, but the question of where metals bind and how to tune metal affinity has not been addressed. We used site-directed mutagenesis of CreiLOV to probe a hypothesized copper(II) binding site that led to fluorescence quenching. Most mutations changed the fluorescence quenching level, supporting the proposed site. One key mutation introducing a second cysteine residue in place of asparagine (CreiLOV<sub>N41C</sub>) significantly altered metal affinity and selectivity, yielding a zinc sensor. The fluorescence intensity and lifetime of CreiLOV<sub>N41C</sub> were reversibly quenched by Zn<sup>2+</sup> ions with a biologically relevant affinity (apparent dissociation constant, <i>K</i><sub>d</sub>, of 1 nM). Copper quenching of CreiLOV<sub>N41C</sub> was retained but with several orders of magnitude higher affinity than CreiLOV (<i>K</i><sub>d</sub> = 0.066 fM for Cu<sup>2+</sup>, 5.4 fM for Cu<sup>+</sup>) and partial reversibility. We also show that CreiLOV<sub>N41C</sub> is an excellent intensity- and lifetime-based zinc sensor in aerobic and anaerobic live bacterial cells. Zn<sup>2+</sup>-induced fluorescence quenching is reversible over several cycles in <i>Escherichia coli</i> cell suspensions and can be imaged by fluorescence microscopy. CreiLOV<sub>N41C</sub> is a novel oxygen-independent metal sensor that significantly expands the current fluorescent protein-based toolbox of metal sensors and will allow for studies of anaerobic and low oxygen systems previously precluded by the use of oxygen-dependent GFPs.",

        "abstract": "Heme is both an essential cofactor and an abundant source of nutritional iron for the human pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis. While heme is required for M. tuberculosis survival and virulence, it is also potentially cytotoxic. Since M. tuberculosis can both synthesize and take up heme, the <i>de novo</i> synthesis of heme and its acquisition from the host may need to be coordinated in order to mitigate heme toxicity. However, the mechanisms employed by M. tuberculosis to regulate heme uptake, synthesis, and bioavailability are poorly understood. By integrating ratiometric heme sensors with mycobacterial genetics, cell biology, and biochemistry, we determined that <i>de novo</i>-synthesized heme is more bioavailable than exogenously scavenged heme, and heme availability signals the downregulation of heme biosynthetic enzyme gene expression. Ablation of heme synthesis does not result in the upregulation of known heme import proteins. Moreover, we found that <i>de novo</i> heme synthesis is critical for survival from macrophage assault. Altogether, our data suggest that mycobacteria utilize heme from endogenous and exogenous sources differently and that targeting heme synthesis may be an effective therapeutic strategy to treat mycobacterial infections. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Mycobacterium tuberculosis infects ~25% of the world's population and causes tuberculosis (TB), the second leading cause of death from infectious disease. Heme is an essential metabolite for M. tuberculosis, and targeting the unique heme biosynthetic pathway of M. tuberculosis could serve as an effective therapeutic strategy. However, since M. tuberculosis can both synthesize and scavenge heme, it was unclear if inhibiting heme synthesis alone could serve as a viable approach to suppress M. tuberculosis growth and virulence. The importance of this work lies in the development and application of genetically encoded fluorescent heme sensors to probe bioavailable heme in M. tuberculosis and the discovery that endogenously synthesized heme is more bioavailable than exogenously scavenged heme. Moreover, it was found that heme synthesis protected M. tuberculosis from macrophage killing, and bioavailable heme in M. tuberculosis is diminished during macrophage infection. Altogether, these findings suggest that targeting M. tuberculosis heme synthesis is an effective approach to combat M. tuberculosis infections.",

A major challenge impeding the implementation of this strategy has been the difficulty to engineer the necessary whole-cell biosensors. Creation of transcription factor-based biosensors in a clinically-relevant strain often requires significant tuning of the genetic parts and gene expression to achieve the dynamic range and sensitivity required. Here, we propose an approach to efficiently engineer transcription-factor based metabolite biosensors that uses a design prototyping construct to quickly assay the gene expression design space and identify an optimal genetic design. We demonstrate this approach using the probiotic bacterium <i>Escherichia coli</i> Nissle 1917 (EcN) and two neuroactive gut metabolites: the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and the short-chain fatty acid propionate. The EcN propionate sensor, utilizing the PrpR transcriptional activator from <i>E. coli</i>, has a large 59-fold dynamic range and >500-fold increased sensitivity that matches biologically-relevant concentrations<i>.</i> Our EcN GABA biosensor uses the GabR transcriptional repressor from <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> and a synthetic GabR-regulated promoter created in this study. This work reports the first known synthetic microbial whole-cell biosensor for GABA, which has an observed 138-fold activation in EcN at biologically-relevant concentrations.

Apoptosis is a well-studied model of cell death wherein the cell destroys itself employing a predefined form of active signaling without the release of soluble cytoplasmic contents to the external environment. Compared to apoptosis, necrosis is a nonspecific form of sudden cell death in response to an invasive external stimulus which in turn is devoid of active programmed intracellular signaling leading to the sudden release of the soluble cellular contents consequent to the rupture of the cell membrane. This fundamental difference between apoptosis and necrosis made us believe that the former is the safe form of cell death and the latter is an undesirable one which often elicits an inflammatory response to the adjacent cells. Recent studies have shown that necrosis also involves a few defined cellular and complex biochemical events similar to apoptosis rendering it difficult to distinguish these two events at the single-cell level using the currently used popular assays.Here we provide a newly described detailed methodology encompassing cell system development along with a multiparametric flow cytometry-based approach to discriminate apoptotic cells from necrotic cells using a stable cell line expressing genetically encoded probe for detecting caspase activation and DsRed targeted at the mitochondria.",

However, most existing fluorescent protein-based BiFC (FP-BiFC) assays still suffer from relatively low specificity or imaging signal-to-noise (S/N) ratios. Thus, developing high S/N ratio BiFC probes, especially in the widely used bright green-yellow region of the spectrum is very meaningful. In addition, synthetic engineering of BiFC probes which can be readily used for multiplexing imaging is also highly valuable for uncovering more or new layers of information on PPIs. In this report, we developed a bright stable green fluorescent protein Springgreen-M based on our previously evolved fast reversible photoswitching fluorescent protein (RSFP) GMars-T. We then established a novel BiFC assay based on Springgreen-M for imaging PPIs in live cells with high specificity.

A somewhat generalizable approach for this challenge is demonstrated here by evolving a naturally occurring chemically induced heterodimer into a genetically encoded sensor for herbicides. The interaction between PYRABACTIN-RESISTANT-like receptors and type-2C protein phosphatases is induced by abscisic acid─a small-molecule hormone in plants. We considered abscisic acid receptors as a potential scaffold for the development of biosensors because of past successes in their engineering, a structurally defined ligand cavity and the availability of large-scale assays for their activation. A panel of 475 receptor variants, mutated at ligand-proximal residues, was screened for activation by 37 herbicides from several classes. Twelve compounds activated at least one member of the mutant panel. To facilitate the subsequent improvement of herbicide receptors through directed evolution, we engineered a yeast two-hybrid platform optimized for sequential positive and negative selection using fluorescence-activated cell sorting. By utilizing this system, we were able to isolate receptors with low nanomolar sensitivity and a broad dynamic range in sensing a ubiquitous group of chloroacetamide herbicides.

The advantage of this approach is that partial photoconversion of the FP makes FCS measurements possible when studying enzymatic reactions. To investigate the process, in vivo we used HeLa cell line expressing the engineered FRET sensor, SAASoti-23-KFP. This FRET sensor has a cleavable (DEVD) sequence in the linker between two FPs for the detection of one of the key enzymes of apoptosis, caspase-3. Caspase-3 activity was detected by registering the increase in the fluorescent lifetimes of the sensor, whereas the diffusion coefficient of SAASoti decreased. This can be explained by an increase in the total cell viscosity during apoptosis. We can suppose that in the moment of detectible caspase-3 activity, cell structure already has crucial changes in viscosity.",

Here, we designed two genetically encoded fluorescent sensors for the real-time detection of PLpro activity in live cells.

A linker with the PLpro recognition site LKGG in between made this FRET pair sensitive to PLpro cleavage. Upon the co-expression of mScarlet-LKGG-miRFP670 and PLpro in HeLa cells, we observed a gradual increase in the donor fluorescence intensity of about 1.5-fold. In the second sensor, both PLpro and its target-green mNeonGreen and red mScarletI fluorescent proteins separated by an LKGG-containing linker-were attached to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. Upon cleavage by PLpro, mScarletI diffused from the ER throughout the cell. About a two-fold increase in the nucleus/cytoplasm ratio was observed as a result of the PLpro action.

        "abstract": "The baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS) has become an important platform for the expression of recombinant proteins and is especially useful for the production of large protein complexes such as virus-like particles (VLPs). An important application for VLPs is their use as vehicles for targeted delivery of drugs or toxins which requires the development of methods for efficient loading with the intended cargo. Our research intends to employ the BEVS for the production of VLPs for the delivery of insecticidal dsRNA molecules to targeted insect pests (as \"dsRNA-VLPs\"). A convenient strategy would be the co-expression of long dsRNAs with viral capsid proteins and their simultaneous encapsulation during VLP assembly but the capacity of the BEVS for the production of long dsRNA has not been assessed so far. In this study, the efficiency of production of long RNA hairpins targeting the <i>luciferase</i> gene (\"dsLuc\") by the <i>polyhedrin</i> promoter during baculovirus infection was evaluated. However, RNAi reporter assays could not detect significant amounts of dsLuc in Hi5 cells infected with recombinant baculovirus, even in the presence of co-expressed dsRNA-binding protein B2-GFP or the employment of the MS2-MCP system. Nevertheless, dot blot analyses using anti-dsRNA antibody revealed that baculovirus-mediated expression of B2-GFP resulted in significant increases in dsRNA levels in infected cells that may correspond to hybridized complementary viral transcripts. Using B2-GFP as a genetically encoded sensor, dsRNA foci were detected in the nuclei that partially co-localized with DAPI staining, consistent with their localization at the virogenic stroma. Co-localization experiments with the baculovirus proteins vp39, Ac93, ODV-E25 and gp64 indicated limited overlap between B2-GFP and the ring zone compartment where assembly of nucleocapsids and virions occurs. Stability experiments showed that exogenous dsRNA is resistant to degradation in extracts of non-infected and infected Hi5 cells and it is proposed that strong unwinding activity at the virogenic stroma in the infected nuclei may neutralize the annealing of complementary RNA strands and block the production of long dsRNAs. Because the strong stability of exogenous dsRNA, transfection can be explored as an alternative method for delivery of cargo for dsRNA-VLPs during their assembly in baculovirus-infected Hi5 cells.",

Because of their spectral characteristics, the use of NIR GECIs helps to avoid signal loss from the absorption by body pigments, light-scattering, and autofluorescence in mammalian tissues. In addition, NIR GECIs do not suffer from cross-excitation artifacts when used with common fluorescent indicators and optogenetics actuators. Although several NIR GECIs have been developed, there is no NIR GECI currently available that would combine the high brightness in cells and photostability with small size and fast response kinetics.

The spatiotemporal distribution and homeostasis of Zn<sup>2+</sup> can be monitored through photoluminescence imaging using zinc sensors. Among such biosensors, genetically encoded fluorescent sensor proteins are attractive tools owing to their subcellular localization advantage and high biocompatibility. However, the limited fluorescent properties of these proteins, such as their insufficient quantum yield and dynamic range, restrict their practical use. In this study, we developed an expression-screening-directed evolution system and used it to improve ZapCY1, a genetically encoded fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) sensor. After four rounds of directed evolution, the FRET dynamic range of the modified sensor (designated ZapTV-EH) was increased by 1.5-1.7-fold. With its enhanced signal-to-noise ratio and ability to detect a wide Zn<sup>2+</sup> concentration range, ZapTV-EH proves to be a better visualization tool for monitoring Zn<sup>2+</sup> at the subcellular level.

Detecting synaptic dysfunctions at the earliest stage of AD would be desirable in both clinic and research settings. Population voltage imaging allows monitoring of synaptic depolarizations, to which calcium imaging is relatively blind. We developed an AD mouse model (APPswe/PS1dE9 background) expressing a genetically-encoded voltage indicator (GEVI) in the neocortex. GEVI was restricted to the excitatory pyramidal neurons (unlike the voltage-sensitive dyes). Expression of GEVI did not disrupt AD model formation of amyloid plaques. GEVI expression was stable in both AD model mice and Control (healthy) littermates (CTRL) over 247 days postnatal. Brain slices were stimulated in layer 2/3. From the evoked voltage waveforms, we extracted several parameters for comparison AD versus CTRL. Some parameters (e.g., temporal summation, refractoriness, and peak latency) were weak predictors, while other parameters (e.g., signal amplitude, attenuation with distance, and duration (half-width) of the evoked transients) were stronger predictors of the AD condition. Around postnatal age 150 days (P150) and especially at P200, synaptically-evoked voltage signals in brain slices were weaker in the AD groups versus the age- and sex-matched CTRL groups, suggesting an AD-mediated synaptic weakening that coincides with the accumulation of plaques. However, at the youngest ages examined, P40 and P80, the AD groups showed differentially stronger signals, suggesting \"hyperexcitability\" prior to the formation of plaques. Our results indicate bidirectional alterations in cortical physiology in AD model mice; occurring both prior (P40-80), and after (P150-200) the amyloid deposition.",

While interactors for the class I interaction, which involves binding of a SUMO-interacting motif (SIM) to a hydrophobic groove in SUMO-1 and SUMO-2/3, are widely abundant, only a couple of examples have been reported for the other two types of interactions. Class II binding is conveyed by the E67 loop region on SUMO-1. Many previous studies to identify SUMO binders using pull-down or microarray approaches did not strategize on the SUMO binding mode. Identification of SUMO binding partners is further complicated due to the typically transient and low affinity interactions with the modifier. Here we aimed to identify SUMO-1 binders selectively enriched for class II binding. Using a genetically encoded photo-crosslinker approach, we have designed SUMO-1 probes to covalently capture class II SUMO-1 interactors by strategically positioning the photo-crosslinking moiety on the SUMO-1 surface. The probes were validated using known class II and class I binding partners. We utilized the probe with p-benzoyl-phenylalanine (BzF, also termed BpF or Bpa) at the position of Gln69 to identify binding proteins from mammalian cell extracts using mass spectrometry. By comparison with results obtained with a similarly designed SUMO-1 probe to target SIM-mediated binders of the class I type, we identified 192 and 96 proteins specifically enriched by either probe, respectively. The implicated preferential class I or class II binding modes of these proteins will further contribute to unveiling the complex interplay of SUMO-1-mediated interactions.",

However, the mechanisms leading to and regulating this complex process are controversial. In particular, poor understanding of Ca2+ dynamics between sperm subcellular compartments and regulation of membrane fusion mechanisms have led to competing models of AE. Here, we developed a transgenic mouse expressing an Acrosome-targeted Sensor for Exocytosis (AcroSensE) to investigate the spatial and temporal Ca2+ dynamics in AE in live sperm. AcroSensE combines a genetically encoded Ca2+ indicator (GCaMP) fused with an mCherry indicator to spatiotemporally resolve acrosomal Ca2+ rise (ACR) and membrane fusion events, enabling real-time study of AE. We found that ACR is dependent on extracellular Ca2+ and that ACR precedes AE. In addition, we show that there are intermediate steps in ACR and that AE correlates better with the ACR rate rather than absolute Ca2+ amount. Finally, we demonstrate that ACR and membrane fusion progression kinetics and spatial patterns differ with different stimuli and that sites of initiation of ACR and sites of membrane fusion do not always correspond. These findings support a model involving functionally redundant pathways that enable a highly regulated, multistep AE in heterogeneous sperm populations, unlike the previously proposed \"acrosome reaction\" model.",

They showed selective expression at the plasma membrane and responded to physiological concentrations of lactate. However, these sensors lost the original ability of HCAR1 to selectively respond to lactate versus other related small carboxylic acid molecules. Therefore, while representing a promising building block for a lactate biosensor, HCAR1 was found to be sensitive to perturbations of its structure, affecting its ability to distinguish between related carboxylic molecules.",

However, the relationships between the redox status and ROS production during apoptosis remain poorly explored. In this study, we present an investigation on the correlations between the production of ROS, the redox ratio FAD/NAD(P)H, the proportions of the reduced nicotinamide cofactors NADH and NADPH, and caspase-3 activity in cancer cells at the level of individual cells. Two-photon excitation fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) was applied to monitor simultaneously apoptosis using the genetically encoded sensor of caspase-3, mKate2-DEVD-iRFP, and the autofluorescence of redox cofactors in colorectal cancer cells upon stimulation of apoptosis with staurosporine, cisplatin or hydrogen peroxide. We found that, irrespective of the apoptotic stimulus used, ROS accumulation correlated well with both the elevated pool of mitochondrial, enzyme-bound NADH and caspase-3 activation. Meanwhile, a shift in the contribution of bound NADH could develop independently of the apoptosis, and this was observed in the case of cisplatin. An increase in the proportion of bound NADPH was detected only in staurosporine-treated cells, this likely being associated with a high level of ROS production and their resulting detoxification. The results of the study favor the discovery of new therapeutic strategies based on manipulation of the cellular redox balance, which could help improve the anti-tumor activity of drugs and overcome apoptotic resistance.",

Although our method showed quasi-quantitative predictive power in the design of cAMP and cGMP sensors, it remains intricate and requires specific computational skills. Here, we provide a simplified computer-aided protocol to design tailor-made CUTie sensors based on arbitrary cyclic nucleotide-binding domains. As a proof of concept, we applied this method to construct a new CUTie sensor with a significantly higher cAMP sensitivity (EC50 = 460 nM).This simple protocol, which integrates our previous experience, only requires free web servers and can be straightforwardly used to create cAMP sensors adapted to the physicochemical characteristics of known cyclic nucleotide-binding domains.",

A plethora of synthetic switches, circuits, and even higher order networks has been implemented in different organisms, such as bacteria and mammalian cells, and facilitates the study of signaling and metabolic pathways. However, the application of such tools in plants lags behind, and thus only a few genetically encoded biosensors and switches have been engineered toward the quantitative investigation of plant signaling. Here, we present a protocol for the quantitative analysis of auxin signaling in Arabidopsis thaliana protoplasts. We implemented genetically encoded, ratiometric, degradation-based luminescent biosensors and applied them for studying auxin perception dynamics. For this, we utilized three different Aux/IAAs as sensor modules and analyzed their degradation behavior in response to auxin. Our experimental approach requires simple hardware and experimental reagents and can thus be implemented in every plant-related or cell culture laboratory. The system allows for the analysis of auxin perception and signaling aspects on various levels and can be easily expanded to other hormones, as for example strigolactones.

Over the last few years, various biosensors for a variety of applications were engineered and enhanced to match the organism and cellular environments, which should be investigated. In this context, the unicellular intraerythrocytic parasite <i>Plasmodium</i>, the causative agent of malaria, represents a challenge, as the small size of the organism results in weak fluorescence signals that complicate precise measurements, especially for cell compartment-specific observations. To address this, we have functionally and structurally characterized an enhanced redox biosensor superfolder roGFP2 (sfroGFP2). <b><i>Results:</i></b> SfroGFP2 retains roGFP2-like behavior, yet with improved fluorescence intensity (FI) <i>in cellulo</i>. SfroGFP2-based redox biosensors are pH insensitive in a physiological pH range and show midpoint potentials comparable with roGFP2-based redox biosensors. Using crystallography and rigidity theory, we identified the superfolding mutations as being responsible for improved structural stability of the biosensor in a redox-sensitive environment, thus explaining the improved FI <i>in cellulo</i>. <b><i>Innovation:</i></b> This work provides insight into the structure and function of GFP-based redox biosensors.

Even though a variety of genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicators have been developed to study astrocyte calcium signaling, understanding the dynamics of endoplasmic reticulum calcium signaling is greatly limited by the currently available tools. To address this, we developed an endoplasmic reticulum-targeted calcium indicator, ER-GCaMP6f, which is anchored to the cytosolic side of the organelle and measures signaling that occurs in close proximity to the endoplasmic reticulum of astrocytes. Using a combination of confocal and super-resolution microscopy techniques, we demonstrate the localization of the indicator in the endoplasmic reticulum in both cell soma and processes of astrocytes. Combining ER-GCaMP6f with total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy, we show that Ca<sup>2+</sup> fluctuations in small astrocytic processes can be detected, which are otherwise not observable with existing indicators and standard wide-field and confocal techniques. We also compared the ER-GCaMP6f indicator against currently used plasma membrane-tethered and cytosolic GCaMP6f indicators. ER-GCaMP6f identifies dynamics in calcium signaling of endoplasmic reticulum resident receptors that are missed by plasma membrane-anchored indicators. We also generated an adeno-associated virus (AAV5) and demonstrate that ER-GCaMP6f can be expressed <i>in vivo</i> and by measured calcium activity in brain slices.

To address these dynamics, we performed in vivo imaging of neuronal activity in the CA1 field of the mouse hippocampus using genetically encoded green calcium indicators, including the novel NCaMP7 and FGCaMP7, designed specifically for in vivo calcium imaging. Mice were injected with a viral vector encoding calcium sensor, head-mounted with an NVista HD miniscope, and allowed to explore a completely novel environment (circular track surrounded by visual cues) without any reinforcement stimuli, in order to avoid potential interference from reward-related behavior. First, we calculated the average time required for each CA1 cell to acquire its place field. We found that 25% of CA1 place fields were formed at the first arrival in the corresponding place, while the average tuning latency for all place fields in a novel environment equaled 247 s. After 24 h, when the environment was familiar to the animals, place fields formed faster, independent of retention of cognitive maps during this session. No cumulation of selectivity score was observed between these two sessions. Using dimensionality reduction, we demonstrated that the population activity of rapidly tuned CA1 place cells allowed the reconstruction of the geometry of the navigated circular maze; the distribution of reconstruction error between the mice was consistent with the distribution of the average place field selectivity score in them. Our data thus show that neuronal activity recorded with genetically encoded calcium sensors revealed fast behavior-dependent plasticity in the mouse hippocampus, resulting in the rapid formation of place fields and population activity that allowed the reconstruction of the geometry of the navigated maze.",

We created a SweetTrac1 sensor by inserting a circularly permutated green fluorescent protein into the <i>Arabidopsis</i> SWEET1, resulting in a chimera that translates substrate binding during the transport cycle into detectable changes in fluorescence intensity. We demonstrate that a combination of cell sorting and bioinformatics can accelerate the design of biosensors and formulate a mass action kinetics model to correlate the fluorescence response of SweetTrac1 with the transport of glucose.

In this work, we employed this method to monitor the early change in the PMP of yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae with intact cell wall, immediately following hyperosmotic up-shock due to various stress agents. The results pointed to differential effects of NaCl, sorbitol and polyethylene glycol (PEG) 6000. Yeast PMP was more responsive toward PEG 6000 than NaCl and sorbitol at comparable osmotic pressure, and PEG 6000 stimulated the largest response magnitude, followed by sorbitol and NaCl, respectively. After prolonged treatment, PEG 6000 also instigated distinct cell morphology from NaCl and sorbitol. Accordingly, this study presents new evidence supporting multiple pathways underlying yeast adaptation to varying hyperosmotic conditions, enabled through the optical physiology approach.

To detect RNAP2 Ser2 phosphorylation (RNAP2 Ser2ph) in living cells, we developed a genetically encoded modification-specific intracellular antibody (mintbody) probe.

An in vitro binding assay using phosphopeptides confirmed the mintbody's specificity. RNAP2 Ser2ph-mintbody foci were colocalized with proteins associated with elongating RNAP2 compared with factors involved in the initiation. These results support the view that mintbody localization represents the sites of RNAP2 Ser2ph in living cells. RNAP2 Ser2ph-mintbody foci showed constrained diffusional motion like chromatin, but they were more mobile than DNA replication domains and p300-enriched foci, suggesting that the elongating RNAP2 complexes are separated from more confined chromatin domains.",

To monitor extra- and intracellular glutamate concentrations in plants, we generated Arabidopsis lines expressing genetically encoded fluorescent glutamate sensors. In contrast to cytosolically localized sensors, extracellularly displayed variants inhibited plant growth and proper development. Phenotypic analyses of high-affinity display sensor lines revealed that root meristem development, particularly the quiescent center, number of lateral roots, vegetative growth, and floral architecture were impacted. Notably, the severity of the phenotypes was positively correlated with the affinity of the display sensors, intimating that their ability to sequester glutamate at the surface of the plasma membrane was responsible for the defects. Root growth defects were suppressed by supplementing culture media with low levels of glutamate. Together, the data indicate that sequestration of glutamate at the cell surface either disrupts the supply of glutamate to meristematic cells and/or impairs localized glutamatergic signaling important for developmental processes.",

We observed spontaneous compartmentalized eCB transients in cultured neurons and eCB transients from single axonal boutons in acute brain slices, suggesting constrained, localized eCB signaling. When GRAB<sub>eCB2.0</sub> was expressed in the mouse brain, we observed foot shock-elicited and running-triggered eCB signaling in the basolateral amygdala and hippocampus, respectively. In a mouse model of epilepsy, we observed a spreading wave of eCB release that followed a Ca<sup>2+</sup> wave through the hippocampus. GRAB<sub>eCB2.0</sub> is a robust probe for eCB release in vivo.",

Fluorescent organic dyes are often used for chromosome labelling in vivo. The mode of binding of these dyes to DNA cause its distortion, elongation, and partial unwinding. The structural changes induce DNA damage and interfere with the binding dynamics of chromatin-associated proteins, consequently perturbing gene expression, genome replication, and cell cycle progression. We have developed a minimally-perturbing, genetically encoded fluorescent DNA label consisting of a (photo-switchable) fluorescent protein fused to the DNA-binding domain of H-NS - a bacterial nucleoid-associated protein.

However, a comprehensive view on the spatio-temporal pattern of SL signaling has not been established, and tools for a systematic in planta analysis do not exist. Here, we present Strigo-D2, a genetically encoded ratiometric SL signaling sensor that enables the examination of SL signaling distribution at cellular resolution and is capable of rapid response to altered SL levels in intact Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) plants. By monitoring the abundance of a truncated and fluorescently labeled SUPPRESSOR OF MAX2 1-LIKE 6 (SMXL6) protein, a proteolytic target of the SL signaling machinery, we show that all cell types investigated have the capacity to respond to changes in SL levels but with very different dynamics. In particular, SL signaling is pronounced in vascular cells but low in guard cells and the meristematic region of the root. We also show that other hormones leave Strigo-D2 activity unchanged, indicating that initial SL signaling steps work in isolation from other hormonal signaling pathways. The specificity and spatio-temporal resolution of Strigo-D2 underline the value of the sensor for monitoring SL signaling in a broad range of biological contexts with highly instructive analytical depth.",

Dysfunction in the organelle Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling appears to be involved in several pathological conditions, ranging from neurodegenerative diseases, cardiac failure and malignant transformation. In the past years, several targeted green fluorescent protein (GFP)-based genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicators (GECIs) have been developed to study Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics inside mitochondria of living cells. Surprisingly, while there is a number of transgenic mice expressing different types of cytosolic GECIs, few examples are available expressing mitochondria-localized GECIs, and none of them exhibits adequate spatial resolution. Here we report the generation and characterization of a transgenic mouse line (hereafter called mt-Cam) for the controlled expression of a mitochondria-targeted, Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based Cameleon, 4mtD3cpv. To achieve this goal, we engineered the mouse <i>ROSA26</i> genomic locus by inserting the optimized sequence of 4mtD3cpv, preceded by a <i>loxP</i>-STOP-<i>loxP</i> sequence. The probe can be readily expressed in a tissue-specific manner upon Cre recombinase-mediated excision, obtainable with a single cross. Upon ubiquitous Cre expression, the Cameleon is specifically localized in the mitochondrial matrix of cells in all the organs and tissues analyzed, from embryos to aged animals. Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging experiments performed <i>in vitro</i> and <i>ex vivo</i> in brain slices confirmed the functionality of the probe in isolated cells and live tissues. This new transgenic mouse line allows the study of mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics in different tissues with no invasive intervention (such as viral infection or electroporation), potentially allowing simple calibration of the fluorescent signals in terms of mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]).",

Despite a large calcium-dependent change in fluorescence intensity, the quantification of calcium concentrations with GECIs is problematic, which is further complicated by the sensitivity of all GECIs to changes in the pH in the biological range. Here, we report on a sensing strategy in which a conformational change directly modifies the fluorescence quantum yield and fluorescence lifetime of a circular permutated turquoise fluorescent protein. The fluorescence lifetime is an absolute parameter that enables straightforward quantification, eliminating intensity-related artifacts. An engineering strategy that optimizes lifetime contrast led to a biosensor that shows a 3-fold change in the calcium-dependent quantum yield and a fluorescence lifetime change of 1.3 ns. We dub the biosensor Turquoise Calcium Fluorescence LIfeTime Sensor (Tq-Ca-FLITS). The response of the calcium sensor is insensitive to pH between 6.2-9. As a result, Tq-Ca-FLITS enables robust measurements of intracellular calcium concentrations by fluorescence lifetime imaging.

Despite their physiological importance, untangling the relationship between DA and NE in the fine control of output function is currently challenging, primarily due to a lack of techniques to allow the observation of spatiotemporal dynamics with sufficiently high selectivity. Although genetically encoded fluorescent biosensors have been developed to detect DA, their poor selectivity prevents distinguishing DA from NE. Here, we report the development of a red fluorescent genetically encoded GPCR (G protein-coupled receptor)-activation reporter for DA termed 'R-GenGAR-DA'. More specifically, a circular permutated red fluorescent protein (cpmApple) was replaced by the third intracellular loop of human DA receptor D1 (DRD1) followed by the screening of mutants within the linkers between DRD1 and cpmApple. We developed two variants: R-GenGAR-DA1.1, which brightened following DA stimulation, and R-GenGAR-DA1.2, which dimmed. R-GenGAR-DA1.2 demonstrated a reasonable dynamic range (ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> = - 43%), DA affinity (EC<sub>50</sub> = 0.92 µM) and high selectivity for DA over NE (66-fold) in HeLa cells. Taking advantage of the high selectivity of R-GenGAR-DA1.2, we monitored DA in presence of NE using dual-color fluorescence live imaging, combined with the green-NE biosensor GRAB<sub>NE1m</sub>, which has high selectivity for NE over DA (> 350-fold) in HeLa cells and hippocampal neurons grown from primary culture. Thus, this is a first step toward the multiplex imaging of these neurotransmitters in, for example, freely moving animals, which will provide new opportunities to advance our understanding of the high spatiotemporal dynamics of DA and NE in normal and abnormal brain function.",

While fluorescent reporters have been widely used, photostability and phototoxicity have hindered their use in long-term experiments. Bioluminescence overcomes some of these challenges but requires the addition of an exogenous luciferin limiting its use. Using a modular approach, Autonomous Molecular BioluminEscent Reporter (AMBER), an indicator of membrane potential is engineered. Unlike other bioluminescent systems, AMBER is a voltage-gated luciferase coupling the functionalities of the Ciona voltage-sensing domain (VSD) and bacterial luciferase, luxAB. When co-expressed with the luciferin-producing genes, AMBER reversibly switches the bioluminescent intensity as a function of membrane potential. Using biophysical and biochemical methods, it is shown that AMBER switches its enzymatic activity from an OFF to an ON state as a function of the membrane potential. Upon depolarization, AMBER switches from a low to a high enzymatic activity state, showing a several-fold increase in the bioluminescence output (ΔL/L). AMBER in the pharyngeal muscles and mechanosensory touch neurons of Caenorhabditis elegans is expressed. Using the compressed sensing approach, the electropharingeogram of the C. elegans pharynx is reconstructed, validating the sensor in vivo.

To address this, we developed a genetically encoded macromolecular crowding sensor CRONOS (crowding sensor with mNeonGreen and mScarlet-I) that senses the degree of macromolecular crowding in MLOs using a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) system. CRONOS is a bright biosensor with a wide dynamic range and successfully detects changes in the macromolecular volume fraction in solution. By fusing to the scaffold protein of each MLO, we delivered CRONOS to MLO of interest and detected previously undescribed differences in the degree of crowding in each MLO.

        "abstract": "Body temperature is maintained at around 37 °C in humans, but may rise to 40 °C or more during high-grade fever, which occurs in most adults who are seriously ill. However, endogenous temperature sensors, such as ion channels and heat-shock promoters, are fully activated only at noxious temperatures above this range, making them unsuitable for medical applications. Here, a genetically encoded protein thermometer (human enhanced gene activation thermometer; HEAT) is designed that can trigger transgene expression in the range of 37-40 °C by linking a mutant coiled-coil temperature-responsive protein sensor to a synthetic transcription factor. To validate the construct, a HEAT-transgenic monoclonal human cell line, FeverSense, is generated and it is confirmed that it works as a fever sensor that can temperature- and exposure-time-dependently trigger reporter gene expression in vitro and in vivo. For translational proof of concept, microencapsulated designer cells stably expressing a HEAT-controlled insulin production cassette in a mouse model of type-1 diabetes are subcutaneously implanted and topical heating patches are used to apply heat corresponding to a warm sensation in humans. Insulin release is induced, restoring normoglycemia. Thus, HEAT appears to be suitable for practical electrothermal control of cell-based therapy, and may also have potential for next-generation treatment of fever-associated medical conditions.",

        "abstract": "In type 1 diabetes (T1D) development, proinflammatory cytokines (PIC) released by immune cells lead to increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in β-cells. Nonetheless, the temporality of the events triggered and the role of different ROS sources remain unclear. Isolated islets from C57BL/6J wild-type (WT), NOX1 KO and NOX2 KO mice were exposed to a PIC combination. We show that cytokines increase O<sub>2</sub><sup>•-</sup> production after 2 h in WT and NOX1 KO but not in NOX2 KO islets. Using transgenic mice constitutively expressing a genetically encoded compartment specific H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> sensor, we show, for the first time, a transient increase of cytosolic/nuclear H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in islet cells between 4 and 5 h during cytokine exposure. The H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> increase coincides with the intracellular NAD(P)H decrease and is absent in NOX2 KO islets. NOX2 KO confers better glucose tolerance and protects against cytokine-induced islet secretory dysfunction and death. However, NOX2 absence does not counteract the cytokine effects in ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> depletion, Store-Operated Calcium Entry (SOCE) increase and ER stress. Instead, the activation of ER stress precedes H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production. As early NOX2-driven ROS production impacts β-cells' function and survival during insulitis, NOX2 might be a potential target for designing therapies against early β-cell dysfunction in the context of T1D onset.",

Gene perturbation screens could provide a powerful approach to probe the molecular mechanisms of protein trafficking, but only if protein localization or mislocalization can be tied to a simple and robust phenotype for cell selection, such as cell proliferation or fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). To empower the study of protein trafficking processes with gene perturbation, we developed a genetically encoded molecular tool named HiLITR (High-throughput Localization Indicator with Transcriptional Readout). HiLITR converts protein colocalization into proteolytic release of a membrane-anchored transcription factor, which drives the expression of a chosen reporter gene. Using HiLITR in combination with FACS-based CRISPRi screening in human cell lines, we identified genes that influence the trafficking of mitochondrial and ER tail-anchored proteins. We show that loss of the SUMO E1 component SAE1 results in mislocalization and destabilization of many mitochondrial tail-anchored proteins. We also demonstrate a distinct regulatory role for EMC10 in the ER membrane complex, opposing the transmembrane-domain insertion activity of the complex. Through transcriptional integration of complex cellular functions, HiLITR expands the scope of biological processes that can be studied by genetic perturbation screening technologies.",

However, GETIs have suffered from poor temperature sensitivity, which may not be sufficient to resolve small heat production from a biological process. Here, we develop a highly-sensitive GETI, denoted as ELP-TEMP, comprised of a temperature-responsive elastin-like polypeptide (ELP) fused with a cyan fluorescent protein (FP), mTurquoise2 (mT), and a yellow FP, mVenus (mV), as the donor and acceptor, respectively, of Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET). At elevated temperatures, the ELP moiety in ELP-TEMP undergoes a phase transition leading to an increase in the FRET efficiency. In HeLa cells, ELP-TEMP responded to the temperature from 33 to 40 °C with a maximum temperature sensitivity of 45.1 ± 8.1%/°C, which was the highest ever temperature sensitivity among hitherto-developed fluorescent nanothermometers. Although ELP-TEMP showed sensitivity not only to temperature but also to macromolecular crowding and self-concentration, we were able to correct the output of ELP-TEMP to achieve accurate temperature measurements at a subcellular resolution. We successfully applied ELP-TEMP to accurately measure temperature changes in cells induced by a local heat spot, even if the temperature difference was as small as < 1 °C, and to visualize heat production from stimulated Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx in live HeLa cells induced by a chemical stimulation. Furthermore, we investigated temperatures in the nucleus and cytoplasm of live HeLa cells and found that their temperatures were almost the same within the temperature resolution of our measurement.

Aberrant changes involving lysine acetylation modification are commonly reported in multiple types of cancers. Currently, whether it is for in vivo or in vitro, there are limited approaches for the detection of H4 lysine acetylation levels. In particular, the main problems are the high cost and the cumbersome detection process, such as for radioactive <sup>14</sup>C isotope detection. Therefore, there is an important need to develop a simple, fast, and low-cost means of detection. In this study, we reported the development of a gene-coding protein sensor. This protein sensor was designed based on the mechanism of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). The four kinds of sensors, varying from substrate and linker length, were evaluated, with ~20% increases in response efficiency. Next, sensors with different lysine mutation sites in the substrate sequence or mutation of key amino acids in the binding domain were also analyzed to determine site specificity. We found single-site lysine mutant could not cause a significant decrease in response efficiency. Furthermore, addition of MG149, a histone acetyltransferase inhibitor, resulted in a decrease in the ratio change value. Moreover, histone deacetylase1 HDAC1 was also found to reduce the ratio change values when added to reaction system. Finally, the optimized sensor was applied to living cells and established to provide a sensitive response with overexpression and knockdown of MOF (males absent on the first). These results indicated that the sensor can be used for screening chemical drugs regulating H4 N-terminal lysine acetylation level in vitro, as well as monitoring dynamic changes of lysine acetylation levels in living cells.",

For three resulting sensor constructs the corresponding glucose induced conformational changes were measured by small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and compared to recently published single molecule FRET results (Höfig et al., <i>ACS Sensors</i>, 2018). For one construct which exhibits a high change in energy transfer and a large change of the radius of gyration upon ligand binding, we performed coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations for the ligand-free and the ligand-bound state. Our analysis indicates that a carefully designed attachment of the donor FP is crucial for the proper transfer of the glucose induced conformational change of the glucose binding protein into a well pronounced FRET signal change as measured in this sensor construct. Since the other FP (acceptor) does not experience such a glucose induced alteration, it becomes apparent that only one of the FPs needs to have a well-adjusted attachment to the glucose binding protein.",

Commercially, it is used in the production of antiviral drugs, infant milk formulas, cosmetics, dietary supplements, and pharmaceutical products. Because of the rapidly increasing demand, metabolic engineering approach has attracted increasing attention for NeuAc biosynthesis. However, knowledge of metabolite flux in biosynthetic pathways is one of the major challenges in the practice of metabolic engineering. So, an understanding of the flux of NeuAc is needed to determine its cellular level at real time. The analysis of the flux can only be performed using a tool that has the capacity to measure metabolite level in cells without affecting other metabolic processes. A Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET)-based genetically-encoded nanosensor has been generated in this study to monitor the level of NeuAc in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. Sialic acid periplasmic binding protein (SiaP) from <i>Haemophilus influenzae</i> was exploited as a sensory element for the generation of nanosensor. The enhanced cyan fluorescent protein (ECFP) and Venus were used as Fluroscence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) pair.

The expressed protein of the nanosensor was isolated and purified. The purified nanosensor protein was characterized to assess the affinity, specificity, and stability in the pH range. The developed nanosensor exhibited FRET change after addition to NeuAc. The developed nanosensor was highly specific, exhibited pH stability, and detected NeuAc levels in the nanomolar to milimolar range. FLIP-SA was successfully introduced in bacterial and yeast cells and reported the real-time intracellular levels of NeuAc non-invasively. The FLIP-SA is an excellent tool for the metabolic flux analysis of the NeuAc biosynthetic pathway and, thus, may help unravel the regulatory mechanism of the metabolic pathway of NeuAc.

The synthesis and storage of melanin occurs in unique lysosome-related organelles called melanosomes, which regulate melanin production via complex regulatory mechanisms. Maintenance of the melanosome luminal ionic environment and pH is crucial for proper function of the main melanogenic enzymes. Defects in genes encoding pH-regulating melanosomal proteins result in oculocutaneous albinism, which is characterized by hypopigmentation, impaired vision, and increased susceptibility to skin and eye cancers. We recently uncovered several ion channels and transporters that modulate melanin synthesis by acidifying or neutralizing the luminal pH of melanosomes. However, our understanding of how melanosomes and other related organelles maintain their luminal pH is far from complete. The study of melanosome pH regulation requires robust imaging and quantification tools. Despite recent advances in the development of such methods, many limitations remain, particularly for quantitative analysis of individual organelle pH. In this chapter, we will provide an overview of the available methods used for melanosome pH determination, including their advantages, limitations, and challenges. To address the critical, unmet need for reliable melanosome pH quantification tools, we engineered a novel genetically encoded, ratiometric pH sensor for melanosomes that we named RpHiMEL. Here, we describe the design and optimization of RpHiMEL, and provide a pH quantification method for individual melanosomes in live cells.

MCS between any known intercellular organelles, including endoplasmic reticulum (ER), mitochondria, Golgi, endosomes, peroxisomes, lysosomes, lipid droplets, and the plasma membrane (PM), have been largely documented and in some cases the molecules responsible for the tethering also identified. They represent specific membrane hubs where a tightly coordinated exchange of ions, lipids, nutrients, and factors required to maintain proper cellular homeostasis takes place. Their delicate, dynamic, and sometimes elusive nature prevented and/or delayed the development of tools to easily image interorganelle proximity under physiological conditions and in living organisms. Nowadays, this aspect received great momentum due to the finding that MCSs' dysregulation is involved in several pathological conditions.

This hybrid labeling system integrating chemical probes with genetically encoded techniques enables molecular position reconstructions of ER morphologies through direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM) imaging. The super-resolution imaging reveals several never-known ultrastructural changes responding to different ER stresses, i.e. the formation of peripheral ER sheets to restore the immunogenicity, and the long flattened ER tubules under inflammation.",

Ca<sup>2+</sup> is a versatile intracellular messenger involved in sensing a wide variety of stresses and regulating the subsequent cellular responses. So far, our understanding for calcium signaling was mostly obtained from ex vivo tissues and cultured cell lines, and the in vivo spatiotemporal dynamics of stress-triggered calcium signaling in a vertebrate remains to be characterized. Here, we describe the generation and characterization of a transgenic zebrafish line with ubiquitous expression of GCaMP6s, a genetically encoded calcium indicator (GECI). We developed a method to investigate the spatiotemporal patterns of Ca<sup>2+</sup> events induced by heat stress. Exposure to heat stress elicited immediate and transient calcium signaling in developing zebrafish. Cells extensively distributed in the integument of the head and body trunk were the first batch of responders and different cell populations demonstrated distinct response patterns upon heat stress. Activity of the heat stress-induced calcium signaling peaked at 30 s and swiftly decreased to near the basal level at 120 s after the beginning of exposure. Inhibition of the heat-induced calcium signaling by LaCl<sub>3</sub> and capsazepine and treatment with the inhibitors for CaMKII (Ca²<sup>2</sup>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II) and HSF1 (Heat shock factor 1) all significantly depressed the enhanced heat shock response (HSR).

The cellular devices can be used for sensing and responding to natural and artificial signals. However, a major challenge in the field is that the crosstalk between many cellular signaling pathways use the same signaling endogenous molecules that can result in undesired activation. To overcome this problem, we utilized a specific promoter that can activate genes with a natural, non-toxic ligand at a highly-induced transcription level with low background or undesirable off-target expression. Here we used the orphan aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), a ligand-activated transcription factor that upon activation binds to specific AHR response elements (AHRE) of the Cytochrome P450, family 1, subfamily A, polypeptide 1 (CYP1A1) promoter. Flavonoids have been identified as AHR ligands. Data presented here show the successful creation of a synthetic gene \"off\" switch that can be monitored directly using an optical reporter gene.

As a result of the depletion of its natural sources, researchers have tried to employ metabolic engineering to enhance α-tocopherol production to meet the human consumption demand. However, the metabolic engineering approach relies on the metabolic flux of a metabolite in its biosynthetic pathway. Analysis of the metabolic flux of a metabolite needs a method that can monitor the α-tocopherol level in living cells. This study was undertaken to construct a FRET (fluorescence resonance energy transfer)-based nanosensor for monitoring the α-tocopherol flux in prokaryotic and eukaryotic living cells. The human α-TTP was sandwiched between a pair of FRET fluorophores to construct the nanosensor, which was denoted as FLIP-α (the fluorescence indicator for α-tocopherol). FLIP-α showed excellence in monitoring the α-tocopherol flux with high specificity. The sensor was examined for its pH stability for physiological applications, where it shows no pH hindrance to its activity. The calculated affinity of this nanosensor was 100 μM. It monitored the real-time flux of α-tocopherol in bacterial and yeast cells, proving its biocompatibility in monitoring the α-tocopherol dynamics in living cells.

While recent advancements of fluorescence microscopy including super-resolution microscopy have enabled us to determine the positions of fluorophores with unprecedented accuracy, monitoring the orientation of fluorescently labeled molecules within living cells in real time is challenging. Fluorescence polarization microscopy (FPM) reports the orientation of emission dipoles and is therefore a promising solution.

Furthermore, depleting an important cellular H2O2 source, NADPH oxidase (NOX), impairs nervous system development such as the differentiation, axonal growth, and guidance of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) both in vivo and in vitro. Here, we describe a method for imaging intracellular H2O2 levels in cultured zebrafish neurons and whole larvae during development using the genetically encoded H2O2-specific biosensor, roGFP2-Orp1. This probe can be transiently or stably expressed in zebrafish larvae. Furthermore, the ratiometric readout diminishes the probability of detecting artifacts due to differential gene expression or volume effects. First, we demonstrate how to isolate and culture RGCs derived from zebrafish embryos that transiently express roGFP2-Orp1. Then, we use whole larvae to monitor H2O2 levels at the tissue level. The sensor has been validated by the addition of H2O2. Additionally, this methodology could be used to measure H2O2 levels in specific cell types and tissues by generating transgenic animals with tissue-specific biosensor expression. As zebrafish facilitate genetic and developmental manipulations, the approach demonstrated here could serve as a pipeline to test the role of H2O2 during neuronal and general embryonic development in vertebrates.",

        "abstract": "Ca<sup>2+</sup> cycling plays a critical role in regulating cardiomyocyte (CM) function under both physiological and pathological conditions. Mitochondria have been implicated in Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling in adult cardiomyocytes (ACMs). However, little is known about their role in the regulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics in human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs). In the present study, we developed a multifunctional genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> probe capable of simultaneously measuring cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> in real time. Using this novel probe, we determined and compared mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity and the coupling with cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics in hiPSC-CMs and ACMs. Our data showed that while ACMs displayed a highly coordinated beat-by-beat response in mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> in sync with cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup>, hiPSC-CMs showed high cell-wide variability in mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity that is poorly coordinated with cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup>. We then revealed that mitochondrial-sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) tethering, as well as the inter-mitochondrial network connection, is underdeveloped in hiPSC-CM compared to ACM, which may underlie the observed spatiotemporal decoupling between cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics. Finally, we showed that knockdown of mitofusin-2 (Mfn2), a protein tethering mitochondria and SR, led to reduced cytosolic-mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> coupling in ACMs, albeit to a lesser degree compared to hiPSC-CMs, suggesting that Mfn2 is a potential engineering target for improving mitochondrial-cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> coupling in hiPSC-CMs. Physiological relevance: The present study will advance our understanding of the role of mitochondria in Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling and cycling in CMs, and guide the development of hiPSC-CMs for healing injured hearts.",

Herein, we investigated the fluorescence depolarization dynamics of recently developed ionic strength biosensors (mCerulean3-linker-mCitrine) in Hofmeister salt (KCl, NaCl, NaI, and Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>) solutions. The mCerulean3-mCitrine acts as a Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) pair, tethered together by two oppositely charged α-helices in the linker region. We developed a time-resolved fluorescence depolarization anisotropy approach for FRET analyses, in which the donor (mCerulean3) is excited by 425-nm laser pulses, followed by fluorescence depolarization analysis of the acceptor (mCitrine) in KE (lysine-glutamate), arginine-aspartate, and arginine-glutamate ionic strength sensors with variable amino acid sequences. Similar experiments were carried out on the cleaved sensors as well as an E6G2 construct, which has neutral α-helices in the linker region, as a control. Our results show distinct dynamics of the intact and cleaved sensors. Importantly, the FRET efficiency decreases and the donor-acceptor distance increases as the environmental ionic strength increases. Our chemical equilibrium analyses of the collapsed-to-stretched conformational state transition of KE reveal that the corresponding equilibrium constant and standard Gibbs free energy changes are ionic strength dependent. We also tested the existing theoretical models for FRET analyses using steady-state anisotropy, which reveal that the angle between the dipole moments of the donor and acceptor in the KE sensor are sensitive to the ionic strength. These results help establish the time-resolved depolarization dynamics of these genetically encoded donor-acceptor pairs as a quantitative means for FRET analysis, which complement traditional methods such as time-resolved fluorescence for future in vivo studies.",

Despite considerable progress made to elucidate the players and mechanisms involved in histone ubiquitination, there remains a lack of tools to monitor these PTMs, especially in live cells. To address this, we combined an avidity-based strategy with in silico approaches to design sensors for specifically ubiquitinated nucleosomes. By linking Ub-binding domains to nucleosome-binding peptides, we engineered proteins that target H2AK13/15Ub and H2BK120Ub with Kd values from 10-8 to 10-6 M; when fused to fluorescent proteins, they work as PTM sensors in cells.

To non-invasively monitor progression of cell cycle in vivo, a family of genetically encoded fluorescent indicators, FUCCI (fluorescent ubiquitination-based cell cycle indicator), has been developed. Existing versions of FUCCI are based on fluorescent proteins of two or more different colors fused to cell-cycle-dependent degradation motifs. Thus, FUCCI-expressing cells emit light of different colors in different phases providing a robust way to monitor cell cycle progression by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry but limiting the possibility to simultaneously visualize other markers. To overcome this limitation, we developed a single-color variant of FUCCI, called FUCCI-Red, which utilizes two red fluorescent proteins with distinct fluorescence lifetimes, mCherry and mKate2. Similarly to FUCCI, these proteins carry cell cycle-dependent degradation motifs to resolve G1 and S/G2/M phases. We showed utility of FUCCI-Red by visualizing cell cycle progression of cancer cells in 2D and 3D cultures and monitoring development of tumors in vivo by confocal and fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM). Single-channel registration and red-shifted spectra make FUCCI-Red sensor a promising instrument for multiparameter in vivo imaging applications, which was demonstrated by simultaneous detection of cellular metabolic state using endogenous fluorescence in the blue range.",

We developed a genetically encoded probe to identify glutamatergic synaptic vesicles at the levels of both light and electron microscopy (EM) by fusing the mini singlet oxygen generator (miniSOG) probe to an intralumenal loop of the vesicular glutamate transporter-2. We then used a 3D imaging method, serial block-face scanning EM, combined with a deep learning approach for automatic segmentation of labeled synaptic vesicles to assess the subcellular distribution of transporter-defined vesicles at nanometer scale.

By fusing a nuclear localization signal to jGCaMP7f, we achieved highly efficient nuclear-specific targeting. Comparing the jGCaMP7f-NLS probe with the previous GCaMP6f-NLS calcium sensor showed clearly that jGCaMP7f-NLS is more sensitive and reverses significantly quicker thereby reflecting rapid nuclear calcium transients in a closely physiological manner. We further confirm that nuclear calcium transients precede nuclear actin polymerization by several seconds. Our data show that calcium-triggered nuclear actin assembly in fibroblasts is independent of the actin nucleating Arp2/3 complex. Together, jGCaMP7f-NLS represents an easy to use, reliable and highly sensitive nuclear calcium sensor that allows to tightly interrogate real-time, spatiotemporal calcium signalling and calcium-elicited effects in the nucleus of living cells.",

While C. albicans is a heme prototroph, we show here that it can also efficiently utilise external heme as a cellular heme source. Using genetically encoded ratiometric fluorescent heme sensors, we show that heme extracted from haemoglobin and free hemin enter the cells with different kinetics. Heme supplied as haemoglobin is taken up via the Common in Fungal Extracellular Membrane (CFEM) hemophore cascade, and reaches the cytoplasm over several hours, whereas entry of free hemin via CFEM-dependent and independent pathways is much faster, less than an hour. To prevent an influx of extracellular heme from reaching toxic levels in the cytoplasm, the cells deploy Hmx1, a heme oxygenase. Hmx1 was previously suggested to be involved in utilisation of haemoglobin and hemin as iron sources, but we find that it is primarily required to prevent heme toxicity. Taken together, the combination of novel heme sensors with genetic analysis revealed new details of the fungal mechanisms of heme import and homeostasis, necessary to balance the uses of heme as essential cofactor and potential iron source against its toxicity.",

However, their calcium-binding domain is restricted by calmodulin from metazoans. In this study, we developed red GECI, called FRCaMP, using calmodulin (CaM) from <i>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</i> fungus as a calcium binding domain. Compared to the R-GECO1 indicator in vitro, the purified protein FRCaMP had similar spectral characteristics, brightness, and pH stability but a 1.3-fold lower ΔF/F calcium response and 2.6-fold tighter calcium affinity with K<sub>d</sub> of 441 nM and 2.4-6.6-fold lower photostability. In the cytosol of cultured HeLa cells, FRCaMP visualized calcium transients with a ΔF/F dynamic range of 5.6, which was similar to that of R-GECO1. FRCaMP robustly visualized the spontaneous activity of neuronal cultures and had a similar ΔF/F dynamic range of 1.7 but 2.1-fold faster decay kinetics vs. NCaMP7. On electrically stimulated cultured neurons, FRCaMP demonstrated 1.8-fold faster decay kinetics and 1.7-fold lower ΔF/F values per one action potential of 0.23 compared to the NCaMP7 indicator. The fungus-originating CaM of the FRCaMP indicator version with a deleted M13-like peptide did not interact with the cytosolic environment of the HeLa cells in contrast to the metazoa-originating CaM of the similarly truncated version of the GCaMP6s indicator with a deleted M13-like peptide. Finally, we generated a split version of the FRCaMP indicator, which allowed the simultaneous detection of calcium transients and the heterodimerization of bJun/bFos interacting proteins in the nuclei of HeLa cells with a ΔF/F dynamic range of 9.4 and a contrast of 2.3-3.5, respectively.",

In this study, we performed a systematic comparison of five different vesicular proteins to target the fluorescent protein mCherry and a Zn<sup>2+</sup> Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) sensor to secretory vesicles. We found that motifs derived from vesicular cargo proteins, including chromogranin A (CgA), target vesicular puncta with greater efficacy than transmembrane proteins.

        "abstract": "Oxygen levels in plant tissues may vary, depending on metabolism, diffusion barriers, and environmental availability. Current techniques to assess the oxic status of plant cells rely primarily on invasive microoptodes or Clark-type electrodes, which are not optimally suited for experiments that require high spatial and temporal resolution. In this case, a genetically encoded oxygen biosensor is required instead. This article reports the design, test, and optimization of a hypoxia-signaling reporter, based on five-time repeated hypoxia-responsive promoter elements (HRPE) driving the expression of different reporter proteins. Specifically, this study aimed to improve its performance as a reporter of hypoxic conditions by testing the effect of different untranslated regions (UTRs) at the 5' end of the reporter coding sequence. Next, we characterized an optimized version of the <i>HRPE</i> promoter (<i>HRPE-Ω</i>) in terms of hypoxia sensitivity and time responsiveness. We also observed that severe oxygen deficiency counteracted the reporter activity due to inhibition of GFP maturation, which requires molecular oxygen. To overcome this limitation, we therefore employed an oxygen-independent UnaG fluorescent protein-coupled to an O<sub>2</sub>-dependent mCherry fluorophore under the control of the optimized <i>HRPE-Ω</i> promoter. Remarkably, this sensor, provided a different mCherry/UnaG ratiometric output depending on the externally imposed oxygen concentration, providing a solution to distinguish between different degrees of tissue hypoxia. Moreover, a ubiquitously expressed UnaG-mCherry fusion could be used to image oxygen concentrations directly, albeit at a narrow range. The luminescent and fluorescent hypoxia-reporters described here can readily be used to conduct studies that involve anaerobiosis in plants.",

The H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> also acts as a central signaling molecule and regulates numerous pathways in living cells. To better understand the generation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in environmental responses and its role in cellular signaling, there is a need to study the flux of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> at high spatio-temporal resolution in a real-time fashion. Herein, we developed a genetically encoded Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET)-based nanosensor (FLIP-H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) by sandwiching the regulatory domain (RD) of OxyR between two fluorescent moieties, namely ECFP and mVenus. This nanosensor was pH stable, highly selective to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, and showed insensitivity to other oxidants like superoxide anions, nitric oxide, and peroxynitrite. The FLIP-H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> demonstrated a broad dynamic range and having a binding affinity (Kd) of 247 µM. Expression of sensor protein in living bacterial, yeast, and mammalian cells showed the localization of the sensor in the cytosol. The flux of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> was measured in these live cells using the FLIP-H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> under stress conditions or by externally providing the ligand. Time-dependent FRET-ratio changes were recorded, which correspond to the presence of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Using this sensor, real-time information of the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> level can be obtained non-invasively.

The morphology of corneal nerves has been studied extensively. However, corneal nerve function has only been studied in a limited fashion owing to a lack of tools. Here, we present a new system for studying corneal nerve function. Optical imaging was performed on the cornea of excised murine globes taken from a model animal expressing a genetically encoded calcium indicator, GCaMP6f, to record calcium transients. A custom perfusion and imaging chamber for ex vivo murine globes was designed to maintain and stabilize the cornea, while allowing the introduction of chemical stimulation during imaging. Imaging of calcium signals in the ex vivo murine cornea was demonstrated. Strong calcium signals with minimal photobleaching were observed in experiments lasting up to 10 minutes. Concentrated potassium and lidocaine solutions both modulated corneal nerve activity. Similar responses were observed in the same neurons across multiple chemical stimulations, suggesting the feasibility of using chemical stimulations to test the response of the corneal nerves. Our studies suggest that this tool will be of great use for studying functional changes to corneal nerves in response to disease and ocular procedures. This process will enable preclinical testing of new ocular procedures to minimize damage to corneal innervation and therapies for diminished neural function.",

Recently, red and green genetically encoded sensors for DA (dLight, GRAB-DA) were developed and now provide the ability to track release dynamics at a subsecond resolution, with submicromolar affinity and high molecular specificity. Combined with rapid developments in in vivo imaging, these sensors have the potential to transform the field of DA sensing and DA-based drug discovery. When implementing these tools in the laboratory, it is important to consider there is not a 'one-size-fits-all' sensor. Sensor properties, most importantly their affinity and dynamic range, must be carefully chosen to match local DA levels. Molecular specificity, sensor kinetics, spectral properties, brightness, sensor scaffold and pharmacology can further influence sensor choice depending on the experimental question. In this review, we use DA as an example; we briefly summarize old and new techniques to monitor DA release, including DA biosensors. We then outline a map of DA heterogeneity across the brain and provide a guide for optimal sensor choice and implementation based on local DA levels and other experimental parameters. Altogether this review should act as a tool to guide DA sensor choice for end-users.",

However, the exploration of plant nanobiotechnology is still in its outset. The search for novel tools to monitor plant biomolecules is an emerging issue for the nanobiotechnologists. Given this, a genetically encoded FRET-based nanobiosensor has been developed to monitor the popular plant cardiac glycoside - digoxin, which is used as the most common prescription drug for heart-related illnesses across the world. Digoxin is sourced from the leaves of the foxglove plant (Digitalis purpurea L.) and has a significant demand in the medical sector. Moreover, with the rising popularity of the herbal formulations in the global market, attention towards the authentication and quality control of the herbal drugs is important. Furthermore, digoxin has a very narrow therapeutic range, i.e., 0.6 nM - 2.6 nM. Therefore, strict monitoring of blood digoxin levels is necessary. Besides, previously used techniques for drug authentication and quantification of small-molecule drugs in blood samples are not the best choice available. The nanobiosensor is based on the FRET (Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer) mechanism, and it is constructed in such a way that it gives a changed FRET output in the presence of digoxin. Two fluorophores, enhanced cyan fluorescent protein (ECFP) and Venus, were attached on either end of the sensory domain - human nuclear receptor ROR-gamma (RORγt). The developed nanobiosensor was named as fluorescent indicator protein for digoxin, (FLIP-digoxin). The ligand binding affinity of FLIP-digoxin was calculated as 425 μM. Affinity mutants of the FLIP-digoxin were also generated to measure digoxin in wide concentration ranges. This sensor offers high-throughput qualitative analysis of digoxin in Digitalis preparations procured from local drug stores. It confirms the authenticity of the preparations through the detection of digoxin. The FLIP-1n was also able to monitor digoxin concentration in serum samples in lesser than 5 min. The nanobiosensor was found pH stable, digoxin-specific, non- interfered by the biological serum species and can perform high throughput screening of the Digitalis powder, infusion and tincture preparations.",

The systolic ratio change decreased in cells expressing high biosensor concentration, possibly caused by Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffering.

        "abstract": "Sleep and wakefulness are homeostatically regulated by a variety of factors, including adenosine. However, how neural activity underlying the sleep-wake cycle controls adenosine release in the brain remains unclear. Using a newly developed genetically encoded adenosine sensor, we found an activity-dependent rapid increase in the concentration of extracellular adenosine in mouse basal forebrain (BF), a critical region controlling sleep and wakefulness. Although the activity of both BF cholinergic and glutamatergic neurons correlated with changes in the concentration of adenosine, optogenetic activation of these neurons at physiological firing frequencies showed that glutamatergic neurons contributed much more to the adenosine increase. Mice with selective ablation of BF glutamatergic neurons exhibited a reduced adenosine increase and impaired sleep homeostasis regulation. Thus, cell type-specific neural activity in the BF dynamically controls sleep homeostasis.",

        "abstract": "The ability to identify specific cell-cell contact in the highly heterogeneous mammalian body is crucial to revealing precise control of the body plan and correct function. To visualize local connections, we previously developed a genetically encoded fluorescent indicator, GRAPHIC, which labels cell-cell contacts by restricting the reconstituted green fluorescent protein (GFP) signal to the contact site. Here, we modify GRAPHIC to give the reconstituted GFP motility within the membrane, to detect cells that make contact with other specific cells. Removal of leucine zipper domains, located between the split GFP fragment and glycophosphatidylinositol anchor domain, allowed GFP reconstituted at the contact site to diffuse throughout the entire plasma membrane, revealing cell morphology. Further, depending on the structural spacers employed, the reconstituted GFP could be selectively targeted to N terminal (NT)- or C terminal (CT)-probe-expressing cells. Using these novel constructs, we demonstrated that we can specifically label NT-probe-expressing cells that made contact with CT-probe-expressing cells in an epithelial cell culture and in Xenopus 8-cell-stage blastomeres. Moreover, we showed that diffusible GRAPHIC (dGRAPHIC) can be used in neuronal circuits to trace neurons that make contact to reveal a connection map. Finally, application in the developing brain demonstrated that the dGRAPHIC signal remained on neurons that had transient contacts during circuit development to reveal the contact history. Altogether, dGRAPHIC is a unique probe that can visualize cells that made specific cell-cell contact.",

        "abstract": "Intracellular calcium can be monitored by various calcium-specific fluorescent dyes including gene-encoded calcium indicators (GECI). GCaMP is a widely-used GECI that emits green fluorescence proportional to the level of intracellular calcium. However, since many tagging proteins also emit green fluorescence, GCaMP cannot be used with another green fluorescent protein. Therefore, it would be ideal to develop a GECI that has a distinct color profile other than green. In this regard, we developed a novel blue fluorescent calcium indicator modified from GCaMP called Ser<sup>222</sup>-Ala<sup>229</sup>-Cys<sup>330</sup>-BCaMP3. Specifically, a simple threonine to histidine substitution to a green fluorescent Cys<sup>330</sup>-GCaMP3 successfully changed its fluorescence to blue (Cys<sup>330</sup>-BCaMP3, B for blue). Furthermore, a couple of additional amino acid substitutions resulted in more enhanced blue fluorescence intensity. Among other Cys<sup>330</sup>-BCaMP3 variants, it was found that Ser<sup>222</sup>-Ala<sup>229</sup>-Cys<sup>330</sup>-BCaMP3 exhibited the strongest blue fluorescence intensity. When Ser<sup>222</sup>-Ala<sup>229</sup>-Cys<sup>330</sup>-BCaMP3 was co-expressed with TRPA1 - a non-selective cation channel - in HEK293T cells, it showed moderate blue fluorescence. One of the drawbacks of Ser<sup>222</sup>-Ala<sup>229</sup>-Cys<sup>330</sup>-BCaMP3 was that the fluorescence intensity was not enough when cells were cultured under 37°C. However, this limitation was circumvented by lowering cell culture temperature to 28°C, allowing much more enhanced blue fluorescence. Although Ser<sup>222</sup>-Ala<sup>229</sup>-Cys<sup>330</sup>-BCaMP3 mandates further optimization, the present study has found a promising blue fluorescent GECI that is derived from GCaMP3.",

To deliver protein-specific contrast, we developed a new class of genetically encoded peptide tags called versatile interacting peptide (VIP) tags. VIP tags deliver a reporter to a target protein via the formation of a heterodimer between the peptide tag and an exogenously added probe peptide. We report herein a new VIP tag named MiniVIPER, which is comprised of a MiniE-MiniR heterodimer. We first demonstrated the selectivity of MiniVIPER by labeling three cellular targets: transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1), histone protein H2B, and the mitochondrial protein TOMM20. We showed that either MiniE or MiniR could serve as the genetically encoded tag. Next, we demonstrated MiniVIPER's versatility by generating five spectrally distinct probe peptides to label tagged TfR1 on live cells. Lastly, we demonstrated two new applications for VIP tags. First, we used MiniVIPER in combination with another VIP tag, VIPER, to selectively label two different proteins in a single cell (e.g., TfR1 with H2B or TOMM20). Second, we used MiniVIPER to translocate a fluorescent protein to the nucleus through in situ dimerization of mCherry with H2B-mEmerald. In summary, MiniVIPER is a new peptide tag that enables multitarget imaging and artificial dimerization of proteins in cells.",

Current redox sensitive dyes and fluorescent proteins can quantify spatially distinct changes in reactive oxygen species levels, but multicolor probes are needed to accurately analyze compartment-specific redox dynamics in single cells that can be masked by population averaging. We previously engineered genetically encoded red-shifted redox-sensitive fluorescent protein sensors using a Förster resonance energy transfer relay strategy. Here, we developed a second-generation excitation ratiometric sensor called rogRFP2 with improved red emission for quantitative live-cell imaging. Using this sensor to measure activity-dependent redox changes in individual cultured neurons, we observed an anticorrelation in which mitochondrial oxidation was accompanied by a concurrent reduction in the cytosol. This behavior was dependent on the activity of Complex I of the mitochondrial electron transport chain and could be modulated by the presence of cocultured astrocytes. We also demonstrated that the red fluorescent rogRFP2 facilitates ratiometric one- and two-photon redox imaging in rat brain slices and Drosophila retinas. Overall, the proof-of-concept studies reported here demonstrate that this new rogRFP2 redox sensor can be a powerful tool for understanding redox biology both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> across model organisms.",

        "abstract": "Carotenoid biosynthesis in <i>Corynebacterium</i><i>glutamicum</i> is controlled by the MarR-type regulator CrtR, which represses transcription of the promoter of the <i>crt</i> operon (P<i>crtE</i>) and of its own gene (P<i>crtR</i>). Geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP), and to a lesser extent other isoprenoid pyrophosphates, interfere with the binding of CrtR to its target DNA in vitro, suggesting they act as inducers of carotenoid biosynthesis. CrtR homologs are encoded in the genomes of many other actinobacteria. In order to determine if and to what extent the function of CrtR, as a metabolite-dependent transcriptional repressor of carotenoid biosynthesis genes responding to GGPP, is conserved among <i>actinobacteria</i>, five CrtR orthologs were characterized in more detail. EMSA assays showed that the CrtR orthologs from <i>Corynebacterium</i><i>callunae</i>, <i>Acidipropionibacterium</i><i>jensenii</i>, <i>Paenarthrobacter</i><i>nicotinovorans</i>, <i>Micrococcus</i><i>luteus</i> and <i>Pseudarthrobacter</i><i>chlorophenolicus</i> bound to the intergenic region between their own gene and the divergently oriented gene, and that GGPP inhibited these interactions. In turn, the CrtR protein from <i>C. glutamicum</i> bound to DNA regions upstream of the orthologous <i>crtR</i> genes that contained a 15 bp DNA sequence motif conserved between the tested bacteria. Moreover, the CrtR orthologs functioned in <i>C. glutamicum</i> in vivo at least partially, as they complemented the defects in the pigmentation and expression of a P<i>crtE</i>_<i>gfp</i>uv transcriptional fusion that were observed in a <i>crtR</i> deletion mutant to varying degrees. Subsequently, the utility of the P<i>crtE</i>_<i>gfp</i>uv transcriptional fusion and chromosomally encoded CrtR from <i>C. glutamicum</i> as genetically encoded biosensor for GGPP was studied.

        "abstract": "To understand the role of intracellular metabolites in cellular processes, it is important to measure the dynamics and fluxes of small molecules in living cells. Although conventional metabolite sensors composed of fluorescent proteins have been made to detect some metabolites, an emerging approach is to use genetically encoded sensors composed of RNA. Because of the ability to rapidly generate metabolite-binding RNA aptamers, RNA-based sensors have the potential to be designed more readily than protein-based sensors. Numerous strategies have been developed to convert the green-fluorescent Spinach or Broccoli fluorogenic RNA aptamers into metabolite-regulated sensors. Nevertheless, red fluorescence is particularly desirable because of the low level of red background fluorescence in cells. However, the red fluorescent variant of the Broccoli aptamer, Red Broccoli, does not exhibit red fluorescence in cells when imaged with its cognate fluorophore. It is not known why Red Broccoli is fluorescent <i>in vitro</i> but not in live mammalian cells. Here, we develop a new fluorophore, OBI (3,5-difluoro-4-hydroxybenzylidene-imidazolinone-2-oxime-1-benzoimidazole), which binds Red Broccoli with high affinity and makes Red Broccoli resistant to thermal unfolding. We show that OBI enables Red Broccoli to be readily detected in live mammalian cells. Furthermore, we show that Red Broccoli can be fused to a <i>S</i>-adenosyl methionine (SAM)-binding aptamer to generate a red fluorescent RNA-based sensor that enables imaging of SAM in live mammalian cells. These results reveal a red fluorescent fluorogenic aptamer that functions in mammalian cells and that can be readily developed into red fluorescent RNA-based sensors.",

To determine yeast membrane potential change, optical methods involving potentiometric dyes have been supplemental to the direct electrode-based method. However, the hydrophobic nature of the dyes and their slow distribution across the membrane still limits their utilization. Genetically encoded voltage indicator (GEVI) proteins employed in neuroscience offer a tantalizing alternative for monitoring yeast membrane potential change. In this work, several widely used GEVI proteins were assessed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae for their expression and function as a voltage reporter. Among them, only ArcLight and Accelerated Sensor of Action Potential (ASAP) proteins could be expressed and transported to the plasma membrane. While the voltage-sensing capability was demonstrated for both ArcLight and ASAP, ArcLight fluorescence was sensitive to the intracellular pH change concurrently with the voltage change. Therefore, we established that ASAP is the more suitable GEVI protein for reporting yeast membrane potential change. This voltage-sensing reporter for yeast based on ASAP offers a new effective strategy for real-time optical detection of yeast membrane potential change, which potentially facilitates many areas of yeast research including optimizing growth conditions for industrial use and investigating yeast ion transport system.",

        "abstract": "Changes in transcellular bioelectrical patterns are known to play important roles during developmental and regenerative processes. The Drosophila follicular epithelium has proven to be an appropriate model system for studying the mechanisms by which bioelectrical signals emerge and act. Fluorescent indicator dyes in combination with various inhibitors of ion-transport mechanisms have been used to investigate the generation of membrane potentials (V<sub>mem</sub>) and intracellular pH (pH<sub>i</sub>). Both parameters as well as their anteroposterior and dorsoventral gradients were affected by the inhibitors which, in addition, led to alterations of microfilament and microtubule patterns equivalent to those observed during follicle-cell differentiation. We expressed two genetically-encoded fluorescent sensors for V<sub>mem</sub> and pH<sub>i</sub>, ArcLight and pHluorin-Moesin, in the follicular epithelium of Drosophila. By means of the respective inhibitors, we obtained comparable effects on V<sub>mem</sub> and/or pH<sub>i</sub> as previously described for V<sub>mem</sub>- and pH<sub>i</sub>-sensitive fluorescent dyes. In a RNAi-knockdown screen, five genes of ion-transport mechanisms and gap-junction subunits were identified exerting influence on ovary development and/or oogenesis. Loss of ovaries or small ovaries were the results of soma knockdowns of the innexins inx1 and inx3, and of the DEG/ENaC family member ripped pocket (rpk). Germline knockdown of rpk also resulted in smaller ovaries. Soma knockdown of the V-ATPase-subunit vha55 caused size-reduced ovaries with degenerating follicles from stage 10A onward. In addition, soma knockdown of the open rectifier K<sup>+</sup>channel 1 (ork1) resulted in a characteristic round-egg phenotype with altered microfilament and microtubule organisation in the follicular epithelium. The genetic tool box of Drosophila provides means for a refined and extended analysis of bioelectrical phenomena. Tissue-specifically expressed V<sub>mem</sub>- and pH<sub>i</sub>-sensors exhibit some practical advantages compared to fluorescent indicator dyes. Their use confirms that the ion-transport mechanisms targeted by inhibitors play important roles in the generation of bioelectrical signals. Moreover, modulation of bioelectrical signals via RNAi-knockdown of genes coding for ion-transport mechanisms and gap-junction subunits exerts influence on crucial processes during ovary development and results in cytoskeletal changes and altered follicle shape. Thus, further evidence amounts for bioelectrical regulation of developmental processes via the control of both signalling pathways and cytoskeletal organisation.",

Using a Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based screening strategy, we found that the orphan transcriptional factor <i>LutR</i> from <i>Bacillus licheniformis</i> is an endogenous sensor of the lactate/pyruvate ratio, suitable for use as a binding moiety to develop a lactate/pyruvate ratio FRET-based genetically encoded indicator, Lapronic. The sensitivity of the indicator to lactate and pyruvate was characterized through changes in the fluorescence FRET ratio and validated with isothermal titration calorimetry. Lapronic was insensitive to physiological pH and temperature and did not respond to structurally related molecules acetate and β-hydroxybutyrate or cofactors NAD<sup>+</sup> and NADH. Lapronic was expressed in HEK 293 cells showing a homogeneous cytosolic localization and was also targeted to the mitochondrial matrix.

Little is known about whether and how Orai1 channel activity may vary between individual puncta. Previously, we developed and validated optical recording of Orai channel activity, using genetically encoded Ca2+ indicators fused to Orai1 or Orai3 N or C termini. We have now combined total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy with whole-cell recording to map functional properties of channels at individual puncta. After Ca2+ store depletion in HEK cells cotransfected with mCherry-STIM1 and Orai1-GCaMP6f, Orai1-GCaMP6f fluorescence increased progressively with increasingly negative test potentials and robust responses could be recorded from individual puncta. Cell-wide fluorescence half-rise and -fall times during steps to -100 mV test potential indicated probe response times of <50 ms. The in situ Orai1-GCaMP6f affinity for Ca2+ was 620 nM, assessed by monitoring fluorescence using buffered Ca2+ solutions in \"unroofed\" cells. Channel activity and temporal activation profile were tracked in individual puncta using image maps and automated puncta identification and recording. Simultaneous measurement of mCherry-STIM1 fluorescence uncovered an unexpected gradient in STIM1/Orai1 ratio that extends across the cell surface. Orai1-GCaMP6f channel activity was found to vary across the cell, with inactive channels occurring in the corners of cells where the STIM1/Orai1 ratio was lowest; low-activity channels typically at edges displayed a slow activation phase lasting hundreds of milliseconds. Puncta with high STIM1/Orai1 ratios exhibited a range of channel activity that appeared unrelated to the stoichiometric requirements for gating.

        "abstract": "Intratumoural hypoxia is a common characteristic of malignant treatment-resistant cancers. However, hypoxia-modification strategies for the clinic remain elusive. To date, little is known on the behaviour of individual hypoxic tumour cells in their microenvironment. To explore this issue in a spatial and temporally controlled manner, we developed a genetically encoded sensor by fusing the O<sub>2</sub>-labile hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) protein to eGFP and a tamoxifen-regulated Cre recombinase. Under normoxic conditions, HIF-1α is degraded but, under hypoxia, the HIF-1α-GFP-Cre-ER<sup>T2</sup> fusion protein is stabilised and in the presence of tamoxifen activates a tdTomato reporter gene that is constitutively expressed in hypoxic progeny. We visualise the random distribution of hypoxic tumour cells from hypoxic or necrotic regions and vascularised areas using immunofluorescence and intravital microscopy. Once tdTomato expression is induced, it is stable for at least 4 weeks. Using this system, we could show <i>in vivo</i> that the post-hypoxic cells were more proliferative than non-labelled cells. Our results demonstrate that single-cell lineage tracing of hypoxic tumour cells can allow visualisation of their behaviour in living tumours using intravital microscopy. This tool should prove valuable for the study of dissemination and treatment response of post-hypoxic tumour cells <i>in vivo</i> at single-cell resolution.This article has an associated First Person interview with the joint first authors of the paper.",

Following almost 2 decades of steady improvements in the <i>Aequorea victoria</i> GFP-based GCaMP series of GECIs, the performance of the most recent generation (i.e., jGCaMP7) may have reached its practical limit due to the inherent properties of GFP. In an effort to sustain the steady progression toward ever-improved GECIs, we undertook the development of a new GECI based on the bright monomeric GFP, mNeonGreen (mNG). The resulting indicator, mNG-GECO1, is 60% brighter than GCaMP6s in vitro and provides comparable performance as demonstrated by imaging Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics in cultured cells, primary neurons, and in vivo in larval zebrafish.

Today, major efforts are devoted toward optimizing red-emitting [red fluorescent protein (RFP)-based] GECIs (R-GECI), as these provide several advantages over GFP-based reporters, for instance, increased imaging depth, reduced photodamage by longer imaging wavelengths and, in principle, are better suited for use with prevalent blue-absorbing optogenetic tools (e.g., channelrhodopsin). However, excessive fluorescence from intersecting neighboring cells in very dense tissues, notably the brain, hinders the ability to collect signals from single cells and their processes. This challenge can be addressed by photoactivatable (PA) fluorescent proteins that can be rendered fluorescent <i>on demand</i> by user-defined targeted light. This allows activation and, thereby, collection of fluorescent signals exclusively from desired cells and their processes, while leaving all neighboring cells in the dark (i.e., non-fluorescent). Nevertheless, there are no PA R-GECIs. Here, we sought to develop PA-R-GECIs. To do so, we initially explored a recently discovered phenomenon of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent increases in fluorescence (i.e., artifacts) in an emerging R-GECI, which has led us to rationally engineer several functional PA-R-GECIs.

        "abstract": "Linking neural circuitry to behavior by mapping active neurons <i>in vivo</i> is a challenge. Both genetically encoded calcium indicators (GECIs) and intermediate early genes (IEGs) have been used to pinpoint active neurons during a stimulus or behavior but have drawbacks such as limiting the movement of the organism, requiring <i>a priori</i> knowledge of the active region or having poor temporal resolution. Calcium-modulated photoactivatable ratiometric integrator (CaMPARI) was engineered to overcome these spatial-temporal challenges. CaMPARI is a photoconvertible protein that only converts from green to red fluorescence in the presence of high calcium concentration and 405 nm light. This allows the experimenter to precisely mark active neurons within defined temporal windows. The photoconversion can then be quantified by taking the ratio of the red fluorescence to the green. CaMPARI promises the ability to trace active neurons during a specific stimulus; however, CaMPARI's uses in adult <i>Drosophila</i> have been limited to photoconversion during fly immobilization. Here, we demonstrate a method that allows photoconversion of multiple freely-moving intact adult flies during a stimulus. Flies were placed in a dish with filter paper wet with acetic acid (pH = 2) or neutralized acetic acid (pH = 7) and exposed to photoconvertible light (60 mW) for 30 min (500 ms on, 200 ms off). Immediately following photoconversion, whole flies were fixed and imaged by confocal microscopy. The red:green ratio was quantified for the DC4 glomerulus, a bundle of neurons expressing <i>Ir64a</i>, an ionotropic receptor that senses acids in the <i>Drosophila</i> antennal lobe. Flies exposed to acetic acid showed 1.3-fold greater photoconversion than flies exposed to neutralized acetic acid. This finding was recapitulated using a more physiological stimulus of apple cider vinegar. These results indicate that CaMPARI can be used to label neurons in intact, freely-moving adult flies and will be useful for identifying the circuitry underlying complex behaviors.",

Although previous studies demonstrated the potential for using 7-HCAA as an acceptor for tryptophan, this approach has not yet been explored within a single protein containing multiple tryptophan residues. A structure-based analysis of a hexokinase enzyme with multiple native tryptophan residues identified glutamate 50 as a potential site of 7-HCAA incorporation; Glu50 moves closer to the native tryptophans upon substrate binding. Substitution of 7-HCAA at residue 50 led to an increase in FRET efficiency in the presence of the substrate; this effect was not observed in a control protein where no change in distance between 7-HCAA and the native tryptophans occurs on substrate binding. This system was then used to directly observe differences in binding affinity of the hexokinase that occur at a number of pH values. Our approach builds on previous research in that it eliminates the need for the incorporation of multiple fNCAAs or fluorescent labels within a target protein and can be used to study substrate binding with native ligands. As such, it serves to expand the versatility of FRET-based techniques.",

Genetically encoded RNA-based sensors are emerging powerful tools for this purpose. However, it was challenging to use these sensors to precisely determine the intracellular concentrations of target analytes. To solve this problem, we have recently developed ratiometric sensors using an orthogonal pair of RNA/fluorophore conjugates: Broccoli/DFHBI-1T (3,5-difluoro-4-hydroxybenzylidene-1-trifluoroethyl-imidazolinone) and DNB (dinitroaniline-binding aptamer)/SR-DN (sulforhodamine B-dinitroaniline). The cellular DNB-to-Broccoli fluorescence intensity ratio can be directly applied to quantify the target concentrations at the single-cell level. Unfortunately, due to the instability of the SR-DN dye, this ratiometric sensor is difficult to use for monitoring target dynamics. Herein, by replacing SR-DN with a stable TMR (tetramethylrhodamine)-DN dye, we developed a ratiometric sensor system based on Broccoli/DFHBI-1T and DNB/TMR-DN, which can be used for dynamic imaging in living cells. We believe these advanced genetically encoded ratiometric sensors can be widely used for intracellular studies of various target analytes.",

As compared to popular GCaMP GECIs, the FGCaMP indicator benefits from calmodulin and M13-peptide from the fungi <i>Aspergillus niger</i> and <i>Aspergillus fumigatus</i>, which prevent its interaction with the intracellular environment. However, FGCaMP exhibits a two-phase fluorescence behavior with the variation of calcium ion concentration, has moderate sensitivity in neurons (as compared to the GCaMP6s indicator), and has not been fully characterized in vitro and in vivo. To address these limitations, we developed an enhanced version of FGCaMP, called FGCaMP7. FGCaMP7 preserves the ratiometric phenotype of FGCaMP, with a 3.1-fold larger ratiometric dynamic range in vitro. FGCaMP7 demonstrates 2.7- and 8.7-fold greater photostability compared to mEGFP and mTagBFP2 fluorescent proteins in vitro, respectively. The ratiometric response of FGCaMP7 is 1.6- and 1.4-fold higher, compared to the intensiometric response of GCaMP6s, in non-stimulated and stimulated neuronal cultures, respectively. We reveal the inertness of FGCaMP7 to the intracellular environment of HeLa cells using its truncated version with a deleted M13-like peptide; in contrast to the similarly truncated variant of GCaMP6s. We characterize the crystal structure of the parental FGCaMP indicator. Finally, we test the in vivo performance of FGCaMP7 in mouse brain using a two-photon microscope and an NVista miniscope; and in zebrafish using two-color ratiometric confocal imaging.",

Catechin is known for its positive role in anticancerous activity, extracellular matrix degradation, cell death regulation, diabetes, and other related disorders. As a result of enormous interest in and great demand for catechin, its biosynthesis using metabolic engineering has become the subject of concentrated research with the aim of enhancing (+)-catechin production. Metabolic flux is an essential concept in the practice of metabolic engineering as it helps in the identification of the regulatory element of a biosynthetic pathway. In the present study, an attempt was made to analyze the metabolic flux of the (+)-catechin biosynthesis pathway in order to decipher the regulatory element of this pathway. Firstly, a genetically encoded fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based nanosensor (FLIP-Cat, fluorescence indicator protein for (+)-catechin) was developed for real-time monitoring of (+)-catechin flux. <i>In vitro</i> characterization of the purified protein of the nanosensor showed that the nanosensor was pH stable and (+)-catechin specific. Its calculated <i>K</i><sub>d</sub> was 139 µM. The nanosensor also performed real-time monitoring of (+)-catechin in bacterial cells. In the second step of this study, an entire (+)-catechin biosynthesis pathway was constructed and expressed in <i>E. coli</i> in two sets of plasmid constructs: pET26b-PT7-rbs-PAL-PT7-rbs-4CL-PT7-rbs-CHS-PT7-rbs-CHI and pET26b-T7-rbs-F3H-PT7-rbs- DFR-PT7-rbs-LCR. The <i>E. coli</i> harboring the FLIP-Cat was transformed with these plasmid constructs. The metabolic flux analysis of (+)-catechin was carried out using the FLIP-Cat. The FLIP-Cat successfully monitored the flux of catechin after adding tyrosine, 4-coumaric acid, 4-coumaroyl CoA, naringenin chalcone, naringenin, dihydroquercetin, and leucocyanidin, individually, with the bacterial cells expressing the nanosensor as well as the genes of the (+)-catechin biosynthesis pathway. Dihydroflavonol reductase (DFR) was identified as the main regulatory element of the (+)-catechin biosynthesis pathway. Information about this regulatory element of the (+)-catechin biosynthesis pathway can be used for manipulating the (+)-catechin biosynthesis pathway using a metabolic engineering approach to enhance production of (+)-catechin.",

In Huntington's disease (HD) and other neurodegenerative disorders, this independence might be compromised due to insufficient glutamate clearance and the resulting spill-in and spill-out effects. Altered astrocytic coverage of the presynaptic terminals and/or dendritic spines as well as a reduced size of glutamate transporter clusters at glutamate release sites have been implicated in the pathogenesis of diseases resulting in symptoms of dys-/hyperkinesia. However, the mechanisms leading to the dysfunction of glutamatergic synapses in HD are not well understood. Improving and applying synapse imaging we have obtained data shedding new light on the mechanisms impeding the initiation of movements. Here, we describe the principle elements of a relatively inexpensive approach to achieve single synapse resolution by using the new genetically encoded ultrafast glutamate sensor iGluu, wide-field optics, a scientific CMOS (sCMOS) camera, a 473 nm laser and a laser positioning system to evaluate the state of corticostriatal synapses in acute slices from age appropriate healthy or diseased mice. Glutamate transients were constructed from single or multiple pixels to obtain estimates of i) glutamate release based on the maximal elevation of the glutamate concentration [Glu] next to the active zone and ii) glutamate uptake as reflected in the time constant of decay (TauD) of the perisynaptic [Glu]. Differences in the resting bouton size and contrasting patterns of short-term plasticity served as criteria for the identification of corticostriatal terminals as belonging to the intratelencephalic (IT) or the pyramidal tract (PT) pathway. Using these methods, we discovered that in symptomatic HD mice ~40% of PT-type corticostriatal synapses exhibited insufficient glutamate clearance, suggesting that these synapses might be at risk to excitotoxic damage. The results underline the usefulness of TauD as a biomarker of dysfunctional synapses in Huntington mice with a hypokinetic phenotype.",

        "abstract": "Erythritol is an important sweetener ingredient and chemical precursor for synthesizing materials with phase transition behavior. Commercial erythritol is primarily produced by industrial fermentation. Further strain engineering necessitates the development of high throughput screening method for rapid detection and screening of mutant strain libraries. In this work, we took advantage of the erythritol-responsive transcription factor EryD, and constructed a sensor-regulator system for rapid screening and characterization of erythritol overproducers. We configured the optimal architecture of the EryD sensor-regulator construct with improved sensitivity, specificity and dynamic response range. Coupled with mutagenesis and strain screening based on biosensors, we rapidly screened and characterized a strain library containing 1152 mutants derived from combined UV and ARTP mutagenesis, in a relatively short period of time (1 week). The optimal strain produced more than 148 g/L erythritol in bench-top reactors. This work provides a reference for other metabolic engineering researchers to develop industrially-relevant strains. The reported framework enables us to rapidly improve strain performance and engineer efficient microbial cell factories for industrial applications.",

        "abstract": "The harmful impact of the heavy metal lead on human health has been known for years. However, materials that contain lead remain in the environment. Measuring the blood lead level (BLL) is the only way to officially evaluate the degree of exposure to lead. The so-called \"safe value\" of the BLL seems to unreliably represent the secure threshold for children. In general, lead's underlying toxicological mechanism remains unclear and needs to be elucidated. Therefore, we developed a novel genetically encoded fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based lead biosensor, Met-lead, and applied it to transgenic Drosophila to perform further investigations. We combined Met-lead with the <i>UAS-GAL4</i> system to the sensor protein specifically expressed within certain regions of fly brains. Using a suitable imaging platform, including a fast epifluorescent or confocal laser-scanning/two-photon microscope with high resolution, we recorded the changes in lead content inside fly brains ex vivo and in vivo and at different life stages. The blood-brain barrier was found to play an important role in the protection of neurons in the brain against damage due to the heavy metal lead, either through food or microinjection into the abdomen. Met-lead has the potential to be a powerful tool for the sensing of lead within living organisms by employing either a fast epi-FRET microscope or high-resolution brain imaging.",

        "abstract": "Information processing and memory formation in the brain relies on release of the main excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate from presynaptic axonal specialisations. The classical Hebbian paradigm of synaptic memory, long-term potentiation (LTP) of transmission, has been widely associated with an increase in the postsynaptic receptor current. Whether and to what degree LTP induction also enhances presynaptic glutamate release has been the subject of debate. Here, we took advantage of the recently developed genetically encoded optical sensors of glutamate (iGluSnFR) to monitor its release at CA3-CA1 synapses in acute hippocampal slices, before and after the induction of LTP. We attempted to trace release events at multiple synapses simultaneously, by using two-photon excitation imaging in fast frame-scanning mode. We thus detected a significant increase in the average iGluSnFR signal during potentiation, which lasted for up to 90 min. This increase may reflect an increased amount of released glutamate or, alternatively, reduced glutamate binding to high-affinity glutamate transporters that compete with iGluSnFR.",

We therefore expressed a low affinity Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator (ER-GCaMP6-150) in the ER, and measured its fluorescence both in dissociated ommatidia and <i>in vivo</i> from intact flies of both sexes. Blue excitation light induced a rapid (tau ∼0.8 s), PLC-dependent decrease in fluorescence, representing depletion of ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores, followed by a slower decay, typically reaching ∼50% of initial dark-adapted levels, with significant depletion occurring under natural levels of illumination. The ER stores refilled in the dark within 100-200 s. Both rapid and slow store depletion were largely unaffected in InsP<sub>3</sub> receptor mutants, but were much reduced in <i>trp</i> mutants. Strikingly, rapid (but not slow) depletion of ER stores was blocked by removing external Na<sup>+</sup> and in mutants of the Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchanger, CalX, which we immuno-localized to ER membranes in addition to its established localization in the plasma membrane. Conversely, overexpression of <i>calx</i> greatly enhanced rapid depletion.

We therefore engineered flies expressing a genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator in the photoreceptor ER.

However, most of them are based on the EGFP protein and have similar molecular brightnesses. The NTnC indicator, which is composed of the mNeonGreen fluorescent protein with the insertion of troponin C, has higher brightness as compared to EGFP-based GECIs, but shows a limited inverted response with an ΔF/F of 1. By insertion of a calmodulin/M13-peptide pair into the mNeonGreen protein, we developed a green GECI called NCaMP7. In vitro, NCaMP7 showed positive response with an ΔF/F of 27 and high affinity (K<sub>d</sub> of 125 nM) to calcium ions. NCaMP7 demonstrated a 1.7-fold higher brightness and similar calcium-association/dissociation dynamics compared to the standard GCaMP6s GECI in vitro. According to fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments, the NCaMP7 design partially prevented interactions of NCaMP7 with the intracellular environment. The NCaMP7 crystal structure was obtained at 1.75 Å resolution to uncover the molecular basis of its calcium ions sensitivity. The NCaMP7 indicator retained a high and fast response when expressed in cultured HeLa and neuronal cells. Finally, we successfully utilized the NCaMP7 indicator for in vivo visualization of grating-evoked and place-dependent neuronal activity in the visual cortex and the hippocampus of mice using a two-photon microscope and an NVista miniscope, respectively.",

The sensor is the improved version of previously reported SenVitAL and consists of ECFP/venus as FRET pair instead of the originally used pair CFP/YFP. To increase the physiological range of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> measurement, affinity mutants were created. Compared to the wild type, SenVitAL-5 with W44Q mutation has higher affinity and displayed large dynamic detection range (0.10-480 µM) in response to vitamin B<sub>12</sub> binding. For cell-based monitoring and dynamic measurement of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> flux rates<sub>,</sub> SenVitAL-5 was successfully expressed in cytosol of yeast and mammalian cells.

The role of Ca<sup>2+</sup> -messaging during the activation of endothelial cells is well recognized and routinely measured by synthetic Ca<sup>2+</sup> -sensitive fluorophors. However, these compounds require fresh loading immediately before each experiment and in particular when grown in state-of-the-art 3D cell culture systems, endothelial cells are difficult to access with such sensors. Therefore, we developed transgenic pigs expressing a Ca<sup>2+</sup> -sensitive protein and examined its principal characteristics. Primary transgenic endothelial cells stimulated by ATP showed a definite and short influx of Ca<sup>2+</sup> into the cytosol, whereas exposure to human serum resulted in a more intense and sustained response. Surprisingly, not all endothelial cells reacted identically to a stimulus, rather activation took place in adjacent cells in a timely decelerated way and with distinct intensities. This effect was again more pronounced when cells were stimulated with human serum. Finally, we show clear evidence that antibody binding alone significantly activated endothelial cells, whereas antibody depletion dramatically reduced the stimulatory potential of serum. Transgenic porcine endothelial cells expressing a Ca<sup>2+</sup> -sensor represent an interesting tool to dissect factors inducing activation of porcine endothelial cells after exposure to human blood or serum.",

Effective application of signaling kinetics to developing new therapeutics requires reliable kinetic assays and an analysis framework to extract kinetic pharmacological parameters.

Stable cell lines expressing GCaMP6s, a genetically encoded indicator of calcium flux, were first established for monitoring mast cell activation and improving detection sensitivity.

We applied synthetic biology approaches to design, engineer and validate a genetically encoded nano-sensor for cellular energy state, AMPfret.

Here we present a sensing platform, termed proximity-activated imaging reporter (PAIR), which combines activity-based methionine bioconjugation and antibody labeling with proximity-dependent oligonucleotide-based amplification to monitor dynamic changes of a given analyte in cells and animals through context-dependent methionine labeling of specific protein targets. We establish this PAIR method to develop sensors for imaging reactive oxygen species (ROS) and calcium ions through oxaziridine-directed labeling of reactive methionine residues on β-actin and calmodulin (CaM), respectively, where the extent of methionine bioconjugation on these protein targets can serve as an indicator of oxidative stress or calcium status. In particular, application of PAIR to activity-based CaM detection provides a method for imaging integrated calcium activity in both in vitro cell and in vivo zebrafish models. By relying on native protein biochemistry, PAIR enables redox and metal imaging without introduction of external small molecules or genetically encoded indicators that can potentially buffer the natural/existing pools. This approach can be potentially generalized to target a broader range of analytes by pairing appropriate activity-based protein probes with protein detection reagents in a proximity-driven manner, providing a starting point not only for designing new sensors but also for monitoring endogenous activity of specific protein targets in biological specimens with spatial and temporal fidelity.",

In order to measure GSH at real-time, a ratiometric genetically encoded nanosensor was developed using fluorescent proteins and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) approach. The construction of the sensor involved the introduction of GSH binding protein (YliB) as a sensory domain between cyan fluorescent protein (CFP; FRET donor) and yellow fluorescent protein (YFP; FRET acceptor). The developed sensor, named as FLIP-G (Fluorescence Indicator Protein for Glutathione) was able to measure the GSH level under in vitro and in vivo conditions. When the purified FLIP-G was titrated with different concentrations of GSH, the FRET ratio increased with increase in GSH-concentration. The sensor was found to be specific for GSH and also stable to changes in pH. Moreover, in live bacterial cells, the constructed sensor enabled the real-time quantification of cytosolic GSH that is controlled by the oxidative stress level. When expressed in yeast cells, FRET ratio increased with the external supply of GSH to living cells. Therefore, as a valuable tool, the developed FLIP-G can monitor GSH level in living cells and also help in gaining new insights into GSH metabolism.",

However, the ArcLight expression, in all cases, relied on a high number of lentiviral vector-mediated random genome integrations (8-12 copy/cell), raising concerns such as gene disruption and alteration of global and local gene expression, as well as loss or silencing of reporter genes after differentiation. Here, we report the use of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 nuclease technique to develop a hiPSC line stably expressing ArcLight from the AAVS1 safe harbor locus. The hiPSC line retained proliferative ability with a growth rate similar to its parental strain. Optical recording with conventional epifluorescence microscopy allowed the detection of APs as early as 21 days postdifferentiation, and could be repeatedly monitored for at least 5 months. Moreover, quantification and analysis of the APs of ArcLight-CMs identified two distinctive subtypes: a group with high frequency of spontaneous APs of small amplitudes that were pacemaker-like CMs and a group with low frequency of automaticity and large amplitudes that resembled the working CMs. Compared with FluoVolt voltage-sensitive dye, although dimmer, the ArcLight reporter exhibited better optical performance in terms of phototoxicity and photostability with comparable sensitivities and signal-to-noise ratios. The hiPSC line with targeted ArcLight engineering design represents a useful tool for studying cardiac development or hiPSC-derived cardiac disease models and drug testing.",

        "abstract": "Genetically encoded biosensors are widely used in cell biology for the non-invasive imaging of concentrations of ions or the activity of enzymes, to evaluate the distribution of small molecules, proteins and organelles, and to image protein interactions in living cells. These fluorescent molecules can be used either by transient expression in cultured cells or in entire organisms or through stable expression by producing transgenic animals characterized by genetically encoded and heritable biosensors. Using the mouse Thy1 mini-promoter, we generated a line of transgenic mice expressing a genetically encoded sensor for the simultaneous measurements of intracellular Cl<sup>-</sup> and pH. This construct, called ClopHensor, consists of a H<sup>+</sup>- and Cl<sup>-</sup>-sensitive variant of the enhanced green fluorescent protein (E<sup>2</sup>GFP) fused with a red fluorescent protein (DsRedm). Stimulation of hippocampal Schaffer collaterals proved that the sensor is functionally active. To reveal the expression pattern of ClopHensor across the brain of Thy1::ClopHensor mice, we obtained transparent brain samples using the CLARITY method and imaged them with confocal and light-sheet microscopy. We then developed a semi-quantitative approach to identify brain structures with high intrinsic sensor fluorescence. This approach allowed us to assess cell morphology and track axonal projection, as well as to confirm E<sup>2</sup>GFP and DsRedm fluorescence colocalization. This analysis also provides a map of the brain areas suitable for non-invasive monitoring of intracellular Cl<sup>-</sup>/pH in normal and pathological conditions.

However, solvent-induced membrane perturbations may confound the use of bioreporters in assessing cellular toxicity from environmental contaminants. This study investigated the solvent effect, wherein membrane damage increases intracellular availability of bioluminescent reaction precursors, increasing the light produced. A new online <i>in situ</i> monitoring system was also tested with multiple bioluminescent reporters, including a newly constructed <i>Pseudomonas fluorescens</i> M3A strain, exposed to toluene, trichloroethylene, acetone, phenol and creosote derived from beechwood tar. Additional tests included the introduction of carbon nanotubes, fullerene and fullerenol. A solvent effect was confirmed by the detection of increased bioluminescent signal and the occurrence of fatty acid release (<i>P</i><0.05). Phenol (25 p.p.m.), a benchmark for bactericidal activity, demonstrated luminescence enhancement via the solvent effect. Membrane toxicity assays showed that <i>P. fluorescens</i> M3A responded sensitively to sublethal and lethal membrane disruptions, whereas <i>Vibrio fischeri</i> MJ1 did not exhibit a solvent effect, and its luminescence changes were not correlated with viability (<i>P</i>>0.05). These results indicate that <i>P. fluorescens</i> M3A is a sensitive biosensor for detecting environmental contaminants and identifying both lethal and sublethal membrane perturbations.

        "abstract": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) initiates viral infection by binding its surface spike protein to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) receptor. Precise delineation of spike-hACE2 engagement is essential for viral entry and a prime target for therapeutic intervention. However, the current antiviral strategies provided only endpoint readouts and delayed the prioritization against emerging variants. Here, this study introduced novel antiviral compounds designed via a NanoLuc Binary Technology-based pseudovirus [NanoBiT; a structural complementation reporter composed of a Large BiT (LgBiT) and a Small BiT (SmBiT)]. Upon Omicron BA.2-SmBiT spike pseudoviruses infecting LgBiT-hACE2 cells, reconstituted NanoLuc generated quantifiable bioluminescence for real-time spike-hACE2 interaction during viral infection. Within this framework, dual-functional theranostic Anti-spike peptide (S7; ACTPHVSPTHCS) and the Anti-hACE2 peptide (A6; WSTDPGAHLRDY) were identified that not only inhibit SARS-CoV-2 entry by targeting spike and hACE2 proteins, but also serve as diagnostic probes for real-time monitoring. Under optimized conditions, significant inhibition of virus infection was validated in both Anti-spike peptide-treated pseudovirus and Anti-hACE2 peptide-treated hACE2 cells, with a synergistic score of 17.092. Cross-variant efficacy extended to the Omicron JN.1 lineage using a newly constructed JN.1-SmBiT pseudovirus, with molecular docking supporting binding at conserved residues. LgBiT-hACE2 transgenic mice and noninvasive bioluminescence imaging verified in vivo suppression and demonstrated enhanced inhibition with combined treatment. This programmable peptide-NanoBiT framework provided multifunctional compounds that integrate therapeutic efficacy with diagnostic capability. Importantly, the modular design highlights its adaptability to other virus-receptor interactions to underscore its potential in pandemic preparedness.",

We have conducted a time-course transcriptome analysis of <i>B. subtilis</i> DB104 in a prior study. In the present study, we identified 10 genes that exhibited strong expression at each time point or all, based on transcriptome data. Subsequently, we assessed the strength of 12 promoters that transcribe these genes using enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) as a reporter. Among these promoters, P<sub>sdp</sub> and P<sub>skfA</sub> had the highest expression levels. At 24 h, these two promoters exhibited 34.5- and 38.8-fold higher strength, respectively, than the strength of P43, the control promoter. Consequently, these two promoters were selected for further development. We enhanced these promoters by optimizing spacer length, promoter sequence, Shine-Dalgarno sequence, regulator binding sites, and terminator sequences. As a result, we successfully engineered the most potent protein expression cassette, P<sub>sdp</sub>-4, which exhibited a 3.84-fold increase in strength compared to the original P<sub>sdp</sub> promoter. Furthermore, we constructed an expression cassette for a human epidermal growth factor (hEGF) using P<sub>sdp</sub>-4 to evaluate its general application. The expression level of His tagged hEGF, quantified using ImageJ analysis and applied to SDS-PAGE, reached the highest yield of 103.9 μg/mL under the control of P<sub>sdp</sub>-4 at 24 h. The expressed hEGF protein was purified, and its bioactivity was confirmed through a cell proliferation assay using HT-29 cells. Our work demonstrates the construction of a highly efficient expression system for <i>B. subtilis</i> DB104 based on transcriptome data and promoter engineering. This system enables rapid, inducer-free protein expression within 24 h. It can be used as a valuable tool for various industrial applications.",

A total of 102 lipid molecules from all fractions were annotated using an in-house lipidomic library. Furthermore, a fraction that exhibited significant activity in the NFAT-GFP reporter cell assay contained α-cholesteryl glucoside, a type of glycolipid, which was successfully identified as a lipid ligand molecule for Mincle.

This study aimed to determine the potential effects of diluted effluent exposure (metals and major ions) on benthic macroinvertebrates in Vulture Lake and McClean Lake. Two monitoring locations located in Vulture Lake and eight in McClean Lake were used for collection water, sediment, and benthic macroinvertebrates. Complementary surface water bioassays were performed with larvae of the midge Chironomus dilutus using lake water from selected sites. Results indicated that total macroinvertebrate abundance and Margalef index (MI) did not follow the diluted effluent pattern. In addition, while the MI from artificial substrate samplers showed higher values in Vulture Lake and lower values at McClean Lake sites 4 and 5 (closer to effluent diffuser), the values recorded for sediment grab samples registered lower indices in Vulture Lake and higher values for sites 4 and 5. The final model from a Generalized Additive Modelling (GAM) approach suggested that electrical conductivity (EC), selenium (Se), and chloride (Cl) in water, and total organic carbon (TOC) and cadmium (Cd) in sediment are key variables that collectively may have influenced macroinvertebrate community composition at the study sites. Finally, across all test endpoints in the bioassays, exposure to lake water from Vulture Lake and McClean Lake had no statistically significant effects on C. dilutus.",

Clinical presentation ranges from the severe early-lethal mevalonic aciduria to the milder hyper-IgD syndrome (MKD-HIDS), and is in the majority of patients associated with recurrent inflammatory episodes with often unclear cause. Previous studies with MKD-HIDS patient cells indicated that increased temperature, as caused by fever during an inflammatory episode, lowers the residual MK activity, which causes a temporary shortage of non-sterol isoprenoids that promotes the further development of inflammation. Because an increase of the residual MK activity is expected to make MKD-HIDS patients less sensitive to developing inflammatory episodes, we established a cell-based screen that can be used to identify compounds and/or therapeutic targets that promote this increase. Using a reporter HeLa cell line that stably expresses the most common MKD-HIDS variant, MK-V377I, C-terminally tagged with bioluminescent NanoLuc luciferase (nLuc), we screened the Prestwick Chemical Library®, which includes 1280 FDA-approved compounds. Multiple compounds increased MK-V377I-nLuc bioluminescence, including steroids (i.e., glucocorticoids, estrogens, and progestogens), statins and antineoplastic drugs. The glucocorticoids increased MK-V377I-nLuc bioluminescence through glucocorticoid receptor signaling. Subsequent studies in MKD-HIDS patient cells showed that the potent glucocorticoid clobetasol propionate increases gene transcription of MVK and other genes regulated by the transcription factor sterol regulatory element-binding protein 2 (SREBP-2). Our results suggest that increasing the flux through the isoprenoid biosynthesis pathway by targeting the glucocorticoid receptor or SREBP-2 could be a potential therapeutic strategy in MKD-HIDS.",

We report a fluorescent probe cellular binding assay (FPCBA) for determination of these values for native (untagged) proteins overexpressed in living cells. This method uses fluorophores such as Pacific Blue (PB) linked to cell-permeable protein ligands to generate probes that rapidly and reversibly equilibrate with intracellular targets, as established by kinetic assays of cellular uptake and efflux. To analyze binding to untagged proteins, an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) vector was employed that allows a single mRNA to encode both the protein target and a separate orthogonal fluorescent protein (mVenus). This enabled cellular uptake of the probe to be correlated with protein expression by flow cytometry, allowing measurement of cellular dissociation constants (<i>K</i><sub>d</sub>) of the probe. This approach was validated by studies of the binding of allosteric activators to eight different Protein Kinase C (PKC) isozymes. Full-length PKCs expressed in transiently transfected HEK293T cells were used to measure cellular <i>K</i><sub>d</sub> values of a probe comprising PB linked to the natural product phorbol via a carbamate.

        "abstract": "Monocytes play a significant role in the pathogenesis of most inflammatory diseases, including autoimmune diseases. Herein, different subpopulations of monocytes often play differential, partially antagonistic roles, in the regulation of tissue populations. Pemphigoid diseases constitute a group of autoimmune blistering skin diseases featuring a marked infiltration of the dermis with immune cells, including monocytes. The monocyte subsets infiltrating the skin, however, have largely remained elusive. Monocyte adhesion and recruitment into the inflamed tissues are regulated by chemokine receptors, most prominently by CCR2 and CX3CR1. To delineate the involvement of monocyte populations in autoimmune blistering skin diseases, we spatiotemporally monitored the dynamic spectrum of monocyte populations that infiltrate the inflamed skin using multiphoton intravital imaging and reporter mice for chemokine receptors. Experimental epidermolysis bullosa acquisita (EBA) was induced by injection of anti-murine type VII collagen (amCOLVII) IgG into the Csf1r<sup>EGFP</sup>-reporter mice, where circulating myeloid cells, such as monocytes and neutrophils, express an EGFP. EGFP<sup>+</sup> cells, including neutrophils and monocytes, were present in the skin, immediately after the deposition of the amCOLVII antibody at the dermal-epidermal junction. To investigate the recruitment and involvement of different monocyte-derived cell populations in the disease course further, EBA was induced in CCR2<sup>RFP/+</sup>-reporter and CX3CR1<sup>GFP/+</sup>-reporter mice. A comparable distribution of red fluorescent protein (RFP)<sup>+</sup> or green fluorescent protein (GFP)<sup>+</sup> was found in both diseased mice and their respective controls over time, indicating the similar recruitment of monocytes into the skin following the binding of autoantibodies. Experiments were extended to the CCR2<sup>RFP/RFP</sup>-deficient and CX3CR1<sup>GFP/GFP</sup>-deficient mice to determine whether monocyte recruitment and disease severity are compromised in the absence of the receptor. A comparable pattern was seen in the recruitment of monocytes into the skin in both reporter and deficient mice. However, in contrast to similar disease severity between CX3CR1-deficient and reporter mice, CCR2-deficient mice developed significantly less disease than CCR2-reporter mice, as indicated by the percentage of affected area of ears. Collectively, our observations indicate that while CCR2 and CX3CR1 receptors are not involved in the recruitment of monocytes into the skin, CCR2 deficiency is associated with improved disease outcomes in experimental EBA in mice.",

We also show that Src-homology 2 (SH2) and Src-homology 3 (SH3) domains, which are required for autoinhibition of Src-family kinases, stabilize these kinase domains in the cell. Our expression-calibrated sensor enables the facile characterization of the effects of mutations and small-molecule drugs on protein-kinase stability.",

To resolve the basis of the timing mismatch between somatic physiology and terminal exocytosis, recently developed probes were used to measure daily rhythms in sLNv neuron synaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> and sNPF release. Remarkably, at midmorning after soma Ca<sup>2+</sup> has dropped, both Ca<sup>2+</sup> spiking and clock-dependent native neuropeptide release peak in the distal terminals of the protocerebrum.

Finally, synaptic DCV exocytosis requires Ca<sup>2+</sup> spike activity at terminals that is not evident at the soma. These results lead to two striking conclusions. First, soma Ca<sup>2+</sup> recording, which is the focus of many circuit studies, is not indicative of presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> and neuropeptide release in distal sLNv terminals.

Calcium influx is one of the start signals for these cell wound repair events. Here, we find that rapid recruitment of all three <i>Drosophila</i> calcium responding and phospholipid binding Annexin proteins (AnxB9, AnxB10, AnxB11) to distinct regions around the wound are regulated by the quantity of calcium influx rather than their binding to specific phospholipids. The distinct recruitment patterns of these Annexins regulate the subsequent recruitment of RhoGEF2 and RhoGEF3 through actin stabilization to form a robust actomyosin ring. Surprisingly, we find that reduced extracellular calcium and depletion of intracellular calcium affect cell wound repair differently, despite these two conditions exhibiting similar GCaMP signals. Thus, our results suggest that, in addition to initiating repair events, both the quantity and sources of calcium influx are important for precise Annexin spatiotemporal protein recruitment to cell wounds and efficient wound repair.",

The pro-cell death signaling, apoptosis, and survival singling, autophagy work in an integrated manner for maintaining cell integrity. Their altered balance drives pathological conditions such as cancer, inflammatory disorders, and neurodegenerative diseases. Dissecting complex crosstalk between autophagy and apoptosis requires simultaneous detection of both events at a single cell level with good temporal resolution in real-time. Here, we have used two distinct fluorescent-based probes of caspase activation and autophagy for generating such sensor cells. Cells stably expressing RFP-LC3 as an autophagy marker were further stably expressed with a FRET-based probe for caspase activation with a nuclear localization signal. The functional validation and live-cell imaging of the sensor cells using selected treatments revealed that stress that induces rapid cell death often fails to induce autophagy signaling, and slow cell death induction triggers simultaneous autophagy signaling with caspase activation. The real-time imaging revealed the time-dependent shift of cells towards caspase activation while autophagy is inhibited confirming basal autophagy confers survival against apoptosis under stress conditions. Confocal imaging also revealed that cells under 3D culture condition maintain increased autophagy over monolayer cultures. High-throughput adaptability of the system extends its application for the screening of compounds that cause caspase activation, autophagy, or both demonstrating the potential utility of the sensor probe for diverse biological applications.",

        "abstract": "Auditory salience is a fundamental property of a sound that allows it to grab a listener's attention regardless of their attentional state or behavioral goals. While previous research has shed light on acoustic factors influencing auditory salience, the semantic dimensions of this phenomenon have remained relatively unexplored owing both to the complexity of measuring salience in audition as well as limited focus on complex natural scenes. In this study, we examine the relationship between acoustic, contextual, and semantic attributes and their impact on the auditory salience of natural audio scenes using a dichotic listening paradigm. The experiments present acoustic scenes in forward and backward directions; the latter allows to diminish semantic effects, providing a counterpoint to the effects observed in forward scenes. The behavioral data collected from a crowd-sourced platform reveal a striking convergence in temporal salience maps for certain sound events, while marked disparities emerge in others. Our main hypothesis posits that differences in the perceptual salience of events are predominantly driven by semantic and contextual cues, particularly evident in those cases displaying substantial disparities between forward and backward presentations. Conversely, events exhibiting a high degree of alignment can largely be attributed to low-level acoustic attributes. To evaluate this hypothesis, we employ analytical techniques that combine rich low-level mappings from acoustic profiles with high-level embeddings extracted from a deep neural network. This integrated approach captures both acoustic and semantic attributes of acoustic scenes along with their temporal trajectories. The results demonstrate that perceptual salience is a careful interplay between low-level and high-level attributes that shapes which moments stand out in a natural soundscape. Furthermore, our findings underscore the important role of longer-term context as a critical component of auditory salience, enabling us to discern and adapt to temporal regularities within an acoustic scene. The experimental and model-based validation of semantic factors of salience paves the way for a complete understanding of auditory salience. Ultimately, the empirical and computational analyses have implications for developing large-scale models for auditory salience and audio analytics.",

It has been shown that the lack of guidance in lesson planning using variation theory is also thought to require particular attention, as the accuracy of the student learning relies significantly on the planning of the lesson. However, little research has outlined the strategy to be followed for incorporating variation theory. This article proposes a method of preparing lesson plans to systematically implement the variation theory in STEM classrooms. The method seeks to design and implement current techniques as follows:•According to variation theory, teachers must create the necessary conditions for learning for the students to recognize what they are expected to learn.•To create the necessary conditions for learning, teachers define the key aspects of the topic to be covered and use different patterns of variations in teaching those contents, such as contrast, separation, generalization, and fusion.•Finally, teachers focus on the key aspects one by one or simultaneously to grab students' attention.",

In PPI analysis, methods using the sensor chips are widely employed to obtain quantitative data. However, these methods require that the target proteins be immobilized on the sensor chips, and the immobilization processes can affect the binding of the target proteins to their binding partners. In the present work, we propose a PPI analysis system in which the surface of the living cells is utilized as a sensing platform. In our approach, the target protein is displayed on the cell surface by expressing it as a fusion protein with a membrane protein, and the PPI analysis is then conducted by applying its binding partner labeled with a fluorescent dye to the cell surface. We have constructed a model of this binding analysis system using the interaction between biotin protein ligase (BPL) and biotin carboxyl carrier protein (BCCP), where BCCP was displayed on the cell surface and BPL labeled with fluorescein was applied to the cell surface. Here, a red fluorescent protein, mApple, was attached to the C-terminus of the fusion protein of BCCP with a membrane protein. We evaluated the binding level of the labeled BPL by using the intensity ratios of fluorescence from fluorescein to that from mApple. We found that the binding level of the labeled BPL was stably evaluated at least across 60 min observation period and estimated the binding dissociation constant between BPL and BCCP by equilibrium analysis to be 0.33 ± 0.05 μM.",

Here porous silicon nanoparticles (pSiNPs) are evaluated as an enzyme cage, utilizing the aqueous chemistry of silicon to dynamically restructure the mesopore structure, immobilizing, and confining the enzyme. The common bioluminescent reporter enzyme nanoluciferase (Nluc) is used to evaluate two different trapping chemistries, and impacts on the stability and catalytic performance of the enzyme are compared with controls involving free enzyme and enzyme electrostatically adsorbed to a pSiNP host without the use of trapping chemistry. The two chemistries exploited in this study are (1) oxidative trapping, where mild aqueous oxidation of the elemental silicon skeleton in the mesoporous silicon host swells and restructures the pore walls, physically trapping the Nluc payload in a porous SiO<sub>2</sub> matrix, and (2) calcium ion-induced condensation, where localized precipitation of calcium silicate entraps the Nluc protein in a porous silicate matrix. The two trapping chemistries form robust nanoscale cages with substantially smaller pores (9.8 ± 0.4 and 8.8 ± 0.3 nm, respectively) compared to the pSiNP starting material (15.3 ± 1.8 nm), such that the enzyme does not leach from the pSiNPs in aqueous buffer or under assay conditions. Enzyme stability is substantially improved using the two trapping chemistries; the caged materials retain 30-45% activity after heating to 80 °C for 30 min or when exposed to organic solvents; either of these denaturing conditions result in complete or near-complete loss of activity for the free enzyme or for enzyme that is electrostatically adsorbed to pSiNPs. Finally, we explore the potential for the use of the Nluc-encapsulated nanocomposite as a cellular probe by demonstrating the luminescent reporting function of the nanoparticles in HeLa human cell cultures.",

We demonstrate that HIPSer has a high sensitivity and relative selectivity for IP6 in vitro. We also provide proof-of-concept evidence that HIPSer can monitor IP6 levels in real time in HEK293T cells and can be targeted for IP6 detection in the nucleus of HEK293T cells. Moreover, HIPSer could also detect changes in IP6 content induced by chemical inhibition of IP6-metabolizing enzymes in HEK293T cells. Thus, HIPSer achieves spatiotemporally precise detection of fluctuations in endogenous IP6 in live cells and provides a versatile tool for mechanistic investigations of inositol phosphate functions in metabolism and signaling.",

High mitochondrial temperature was maintained in the face of a variety of metabolic stresses, including substrate starvation or modification, decreased ATP demand due to inhibition of cytosolic protein synthesis, inhibition of the mitochondrial adenine nucleotide transporter and, if an auxiliary pathway for electron transfer was available via the alternative oxidase, even respiratory poisons acting downstream of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complex I.

The A<sub>2A</sub> receptor antagonist ZM241385 inhibited the responses. Similar transient increases in astrocytic cAMP occurred when olfactory receptor neurons were stimulated electrically, resulting in ATP release from the stimulated axons that increased cAMP, again via A<sub>2A</sub> receptors.

Therefore, non-target analysis (NTA) studies are increasingly conducted to detect unknown or unnoticed PFAS. These studies are often based on a few grab samples. Thus, discontinuously emitted PFAS from industrial batch processes might be easily overlooked. To address this deficiency and obtain in-depth information on the occurrence and temporal trend of PFAS in surface water impacted by treated industrial waste water, a comprehensive target and NTA study was implemented for 29 months. Elevated PFAS concentrations with up to 10.8 μg L<sup>-1</sup> were detected in the river water by target analysis. In addition to PFAS target analysis, the water samples were analyzed by liquid chromatography-high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS/MS). Data processing strategies and various filtering steps were applied to prioritize PFAS. Substances were identified by comparing data to available internal and external PFAS suspect lists, a fragment ion and neutral loss list, and spectral libraries. Several compounds were unequivocally identified based on reference standards. Fifty-five PFAS were (tentatively) identified using NTA. Of those, 43 could be assigned to 13 different homologous series. Partly fluorinated short-chain carboxylic acids (H-PFCA) and sulfonic acids (H-PFSA) were predominantly found in addition to perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCA) and the alkyl ether carboxylic acid DONA. To the best of our knowledge, 12 PFAS were reported in surface water for the first time. Signal intensities of individual PFAS and signal ratios varied widely over time, which may indicate batch operations leading to discontinuous emission. Results and insights from this screening approach on PFAS can be used to optimize forthcoming surface water monitoring programs by including newly identified PFAS and selecting appropriate sampling intervals.",

Evidence suggests tau functions as a prion, and cells and animals can efficiently propagate unique, transmissible tau pathologies. This suggests a dedicated cellular replication machinery, potentially reflecting a normal physiologic function for tau seeds. Consequently, we hypothesized that healthy control brains would contain seeding activity. We have recently developed a novel monoclonal antibody (MD3.1) specific for tau seeds. We used this antibody to immunopurify tau from the parietal and cerebellar cortices of 19 healthy subjects without any neuropathology, ranging 19 to 65 years. We detected seeding in lysates from the parietal cortex, but not in the cerebellum. We also detected no seeding in brain homogenates from wildtype or human tau knockin mice, suggesting that cellular/genetic context dictates development of seed-competent tau. Seeding did not correlate with subject age or brain tau levels. We confirmed our essential findings using an orthogonal assay, real-time quaking-induced conversion, which amplifies tau seeds in vitro. Dot blot analyses revealed no AT8 immunoreactivity above background levels in parietal and cerebellar extracts and ∼1/100 of that present in AD. Based on binding to a panel of antibodies, the conformational characteristics of control seeds differed from AD, suggesting a unique underlying assembly, or structural ensemble. Tau's ability to adopt self-replicating conformations under nonpathogenic conditions may reflect a normal function that goes awry in disease states.",

The regular DNA motifs on natural operon were reconfigured and coupled with the enhanced Green Fluorescent Protein (eGFP) reporter to develop a novel basic NOT type logic gate CadA/CadR-eGFP to respond metal ions mentioned above. A Genetically Engineered Microbial (GEM)-based biosensor (E.coli-BL21:pJET1.2-CadA/CadR-eGFP) was developed by cloning the chemically synthesised CadA/CadR-eGFP gene circuit into pJET1.2-plasmid and transforming into Escherichia coli (E. coli)-BL21 bacterial cells. The GEM-based biosensor cells indicated the reporter gene expression in the presence of Cd<sup>2+</sup>, Zn<sup>2+</sup> and Pb<sup>2+</sup> either singly or in combination.

        "abstract": "<b>Introduction:</b> The endocannabinoids (eCBs), 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) and arachidonoyl ethanolamine (AEA), are produced by separate enzymatic pathways, activate cannabinoid (CB) receptors with distinct pharmacological profiles, and differentially regulate pathophysiological processes. The genetically encoded sensor, GRAB<sub>eCB2.0</sub>, detects real-time changes in eCB levels in cells in culture and preclinical model systems; however, its activation by eCB analogues produced by cells and by phyto-CBs remains uncharacterized, a current limitation when interpreting changes in its response. This information could provide additional utility for the tool in <i>in vivo</i> pharmacology studies of phyto-CB action. <b>Materials and Methods:</b> GRAB<sub>eCB2.0</sub> was expressed in cultured HEK293 cells. Live cell confocal microscopy and high-throughput fluorescent signal measurements. <b>Results:</b> 2-AG increased GRAB<sub>eCB2.0</sub> fluorescent signal (EC<sub>50</sub>=85 nM), and the cannabinoid 1 receptor (CB<sub>1</sub>R) antagonist, SR141716 (SR1), decreased GRAB<sub>eCB2.0</sub> signal (IC<sub>50</sub>=3.3 nM), responses that mirror their known potencies at the CB<sub>1</sub>R. GRAB<sub>eCB2.0</sub> fluorescent signal also increased in response to AEA (EC<sub>50</sub>=815 nM), the eCB analogues 2-linoleoylglycerol and 2-oleoylglycerol (EC<sub>50</sub>=632 and 868 nM, respectively), Δ<sup>9</sup>-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ<sup>9</sup>-THC), and Δ<sup>8</sup>-THC (EC<sub>50</sub>=1.6 and 2.0 μM, respectively), and the artificial CB<sub>1</sub>R agonist, CP55,940 (CP; EC<sub>50</sub>=82 nM); however their potencies were less than what has been described at CB<sub>1</sub>R. Cannabidiol (CBD) did not affect basal GRAB<sub>eCB2.0</sub> fluorescent signal and yet reduced the 2-AG stimulated GRAB<sub>eCB2.0</sub> responses (IC<sub>50</sub>=9.7 nM). <b>Conclusions:</b> 2-AG and SR1 modulate the GRAB<sub>eCB2.0</sub> fluorescent signal with EC<sub>50</sub> values that mirror their potencies at CB<sub>1</sub>R, whereas AEA, eCB analogues, THC, and CP increase GRAB<sub>eCB2.0</sub> fluorescent signal with EC<sub>50</sub> values significantly lower than their potencies at CB<sub>1</sub>R. CBD reduces the 2-AG response without affecting basal signal, suggesting that GRAB<sub>eCB2.0</sub> retains the negative allosteric modulator (NAM) property of CBD at CB<sub>1</sub>R. This study describes the pharmacological profile of GRAB<sub>eCB2.0</sub> to improve interpretation of changes in fluorescent signal in response to a series of known eCBs and CB<sub>1</sub>R ligands.",

Despite evidence that catecholamines contribute to contextual encoding and memory retrieval, the precise temporal dynamics of their release in the hippocampus during behavior is unknown. In addition, new animal models are required to probe the effects of altered catecholamine synthesis on release dynamics and contextual learning. We generated 2 new mouse models of altered locus coeruleus-norepinephrine (NE) synthesis and utilized them together with GRAB<sub>NE</sub> and GRAB<sub>DA</sub> sensors and in vivo fiber photometry to investigate NE and dopamine (DA) release dynamics in the dorsal hippocampal CA1 during contextual fear conditioning. Aversive foot shock increased both NE and DA release in the dorsal CA1, while freezing behavior associated with recall of fear memory was accompanied by decreased release. Moreover, we found that freezing at the recent time point was sensitive to both partial and complete loss of locus coeruleus-NE synthesis throughout prenatal and postnatal development, similar to previous observations of mice with global loss of NE synthesis beginning postnatally. In contrast, freezing at the remote time point was compromised only by complete loss of locus coeruleus-NE synthesis beginning prenatally. Overall, these findings provide novel insights into the role of NE in contextual fear and the precise temporal dynamics of both NE and DA during freezing behavior and highlight complex relationships between genotype, sex, and NE signaling.",

Cortical neuronal functional signals (GCaMP6s; genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor) were recorded from both mice simultaneously before, during, and after the social contact period. When the mice were together, we observed bouts of mutual whisking and cross-mouse correlated cortical activity across the cortex.

Whisking-related cortical signals were observed during the period where mice were together (closest contact).

Despite several reports regarding targeted integration techniques in Xenopus, there is still room for improvement of them, especially in creating reporter lines that rely on endogenous regulatory enhancers/promoters. We developed a CRISPR-Cas9-based simple method to efficiently introduce a fluorescent protein gene into 5' untranslated regions (5'UTRs) of target genes in Xenopus laevis. A donor plasmid DNA encoding an enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) flanked by a genomic fragment ranging from 66 bp to 878 bp including target 5'UTR was co-injected into fertilized eggs with a single guide RNA and Cas9 protein. Injections for krt12.2.L, myod1.S, sox2.L or brevican.S resulted in embryos expressing eGFP fluorescence in a tissue-specific manner, recapitulating endogenous expression of target genes. Integrations of the donor DNA into the target regions were examined by genotyping PCR for the eGFP-expressing embryos. The rate of embryos expressing the specific eGFP varied from 2.1% to 13.2% depending on the target locus and length of the genomic fragment in the donor plasmids. Germline transmission of an integrated DNA was observed. This simple method provides a powerful tool for exploring gene expression and function in developmental and regeneration research in X. laevis.",

In this study, we systematically assessed sex differences in colorectal neural encoding by conducting high-throughput optical recordings in intact dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) from control and visceral hypersensitive mice. We found an apparent sex difference in zymosan-induced behavioral visceral hypersensitivity: enhanced visceromotor responses to colorectal distension were observed only in male mice, not in female mice. In addition, a higher number of mechanosensitive colorectal afferents were identified per mouse in the zymosan-treated male group than in the saline-treated male group, whereas the mechanosensitive afferents identified per mouse were comparable between the zymosan- and saline-treated female groups. The increased number of identified afferents in zymosan-treated male mice was predominantly from thoracolumbar (TL) innervation, which agrees with the significant increase in the TL afferent proportion in the zymosan group as compared with the control group in male mice. In contrast, female mice showed no difference in the proportion of colorectal neurons between saline- and zymosan-treated groups. Our results revealed a significant sex difference in colorectal afferent innervation and sensitization in the context of behavioral visceral hypersensitivity, which could drive differential clinical symptoms in male and female patients.<b>NEW & NOTEWORTHY</b> We used high-throughput GCaMP6f recordings to study 2,275 mechanosensitive colorectal afferents in mice.

However, the mechanisms how reactive oxygen species trigger cellular damage are not fully understood. Our study investigates redox state and highly reactive substances within neonatal and adult cardiomyocytes under hypoxia conditions. We have found that hypoxia induced an increase in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production in adult cardiomyocytes, while neonatal cardiomyocytes experienced a decrease in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> levels. This finding correlates with our observation of the difference between the electron transport chain (ETC) properties and mitochondria amount in adult and neonatal cells. We demonstrated that in adult cardiomyocytes hypoxia caused the significant increase in the ETC loading with electrons compared to normoxia. On the contrary, in neonatal cardiomyocytes ETC loading with electrons was similar under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions that could be due to ETC non-functional state and the absence of the electrons transfer to O<sub>2</sub> under normoxia. In addition to the variations in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production, we also noted consistent pH dynamics under hypoxic conditions. Notably, the pH levels exhibited a similar decrease in both cell types, thus, acidosis is a more universal cellular response to hypoxia. We also demonstrated that the amount of mitochondria and the levels of cardiac isoforms of troponin I, troponin T, myoglobin and GAPDH were significantly higher in adult cardiomyocytes compared to neonatal ones. Remarkably, we found out that under hypoxia, the levels of cardiac isoforms of troponin T, myoglobin, and GAPDH were elevated in adult cardiomyocytes, while their level in neonatal cells remained unchanged. Obtained data contribute to the understanding of the mechanisms of neonatal cardiomyocytes' resistance to hypoxia and the ability to maintain the metabolic homeostasis in contrast to adult ones.",

Propofol-induced PKC activation in cells was estimated using the C kinase activity receptor (CKAR), an indicator of intracellular PKC activation. We also examined PKC translocation using isomers and derivatives of propofol to identify the crucial structural motifs involved in this process. <b>Key results:</b> Propofol persistently translocated PKCα conventional PKCs and PKCδ from novel PKCs (nPKCs) to the plasma membrane (PM). Propofol translocated PKCδ and PKCη of nPKCs to the Golgi apparatus and endoplasmic reticulum, respectively. Propofol also induced the nuclear translocation of PKCζ of atypical PKCs or proteins other than PKCs, such that the protein concentration inside and outside the nucleus became uniform. CKAR analysis revealed that propofol activated PKC in the PM and Golgi apparatus. Moreover, tests using isomers and derivatives of propofol predicted that the structural motifs important for the induction of PKC and nuclear translocation are different. <b>Conclusion and implications:</b> Propofol induced the subtype-specific intracellular translocation of PKCs and activated PKCs. Additionally, propofol induced the nuclear translocation of PKCs and other proteins, probably by altering the permeability of the nuclear envelope. Interestingly, propofol-induced PKC and nuclear translocation may occur via different mechanisms. Our findings provide insights into the action mechanisms of propofol.",

Consequently, severe coastal erosion has occurred in the area, particularly during the northeast monsoon season (NEM). Numerous types of coastal defense structures (CDS) have been constructed to protect the coastline. Despite the loss of esthetic values, the effect of CDS construction on marine organisms in the area remains unknown. Hence, this study aims to assess the ecological aspects of macrobenthic compositions at the CDS area of Kuala Nerus, Terengganu, based on the differences between the southwest (SWM) and northeast (NEM) monsoon seasons. Macrobenthos were collected from the sediment in July (SWM) and December 2021 (NEM) using the Ponar grab at 12 substations from five sampling stations. The density of macrobenthos was higher in SWM (48,190.82 ind./m<sup>2</sup>) than in NEM (24,504.83 ind./m<sup>2</sup>), with phylum Mollusca recording the highest species composition (60-99.3%). The macrobenthos species had a low to moderate level of diversity (H' = 1.4-3.1) with the species were almost evenly distributed (J' = 0.2-0.8). Windward substations exhibited coarser grain sizes (38.56%-86.84%), whereas landward substations exhibited very fine grain sizes (44.26%-86.70%). The SWM season recorded a higher organic matter content (1.6%-6.33%) than the NEM season (0.4%-3.1%). However, metal concentrations in the surface sediment were within the safe range and permissible limits for both seasons, inferring that the macrobenthos composition was unaffected. This study demonstrated that the CDS associated with the monsoon system has controlled the hydrodynamics and nearshore sedimentary processes in the Kuala Nerus coastal zone, thereby affecting the macrobenthos population, in terms of richness and density. The ecological and energetic effects of the coastal structures in different seasons have resulted in a more significant result, with the SWM exhibiting a higher macrobenthos composition than the NEM.",

Plant-antagonist interactions can jeopardize plant-pollinator interactions, while soil mutualists can enhance plant-pollinator interactions. This suggests that soil legacy, either directly or mediated through plant symbionts, affects pollinators. Despite the importance of pollinators to natural and managed ecosystems, information on how soil legacy affects plant-pollinator interactions is limited. We assessed effects of soil management legacy (organic versus conventional) on floral rewards and plant interactions with wild pollinators, herbivores, beneficial fungi and pathogens. We used an observational dataset and structural equation models to evaluate hypothesized relationships between soil and pollinators, then tested observed correlations in a manipulative experiment. Organic legacy increased mycorrhizal fungal colonization and improved resistance to powdery mildew, which promoted pollinator visitation. Further, soil legacy and powdery mildew independently and interactively impacted floral traits and floral reward nutrients, which are important to pollinators. Our results indicate that pollination could be an overlooked consequence of soil legacy and suggests opportunity to develop long-term soil management plans that benefit pollinators and pollination.",

        "abstract": "Dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens has been hypothesized to signal reward prediction error, the difference between observed and predicted reward, suggesting a biological implementation for reinforcement learning. Rigorous tests of this hypothesis require assumptions about how the brain maps sensory signals to reward predictions, yet this mapping is still poorly understood. In particular, the mapping is non-trivial when sensory signals provide ambiguous information about the hidden state of the environment. Previous work using classical conditioning tasks has suggested that reward predictions are generated conditional on probabilistic beliefs about the hidden state, such that dopamine implicitly reflects these beliefs. Here we test this hypothesis in the context of an instrumental task (a two-armed bandit), where the hidden state switches repeatedly. We measured choice behavior and recorded dLight signals reflecting dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens core. Model comparison among a wide set of cognitive models based on the behavioral data favored models that used Bayesian updating of probabilistic beliefs. These same models also quantitatively matched the dopamine measurements better than non-Bayesian alternatives. We conclude that probabilistic belief computation contributes to instrumental task performance in mice and is reflected in mesolimbic dopamine signaling.",

        "abstract": "<i>Histoplasma capsulatum</i> is a dimorphic fungal pathogen acquired via inhalation of soil-resident spores. Upon exposure to mammalian body temperatures, these fungal elements transform into yeasts that reside primarily within phagocytes. Macrophages (MΦ) provide a permissive environment for fungal replication until T cell-dependent immunity is engaged. MΦ activated by granulocyte-MΦ colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) induce metallothioneins (MTs) that bind zinc (Zn) and deprive yeast cells of labile Zn, thereby disabling fungal growth. Prior work demonstrated that the high affinity zinc importer, ZRT2, was important for fungal survival in vivo. Hence, we constructed a yeast cell reporter strain that expresses green fluorescent protein (GFP) under the control of this importer. This reporter accurately responds to medium devoid of Zn. ZRT2 expression increased (∼5-fold) in GM-CSF, but not interferon-γ, stimulated MΦ. To examine the in vivo response, we infected mice with reporter yeasts and assessed ZRT2 expression at 0-, 3-, 7-, and 14-days post-infection (dpi). ZRT2 expression minimally increased at 3-dpi and peaked on 7-dpi, corresponding with onset of adaptive immunity. We discovered that the major phagocyte populations that restrict Zn to the fungus are interstitial MΦ and exudate MΦ. Neutralizing GM-CSF blunted control of infection but unexpectedly increased ZRT2 expression. This increase was dependent on another cytokine that activates MΦ to control <i>H. capsulatum</i> replication, M-CSF. These findings illustrate the reporter's ability to sense Zn <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> and correlate ZRT2 activity with GM-CSF and M-CSF activation of MΦ. Phagocytes use an arsenal of defenses to control replication of <i>Histoplasma</i> yeasts, one of which is limitation of trace metals. On the other hand, <i>H. capsulatum</i> combats metal restriction by upregulating metal importers such as the Zn importer ZRT2. This transporter contributes to <i>H. capsulatum</i> pathogenesis upon activation of adaptive immunity. We constructed a fluorescent ZRT2 reporter to probe <i>H. capsulatum</i> Zn sensing during infection and exposed a role for M-CSF activation of macrophages when GM-CSF is absent. These data highlight the ways in which fungal pathogens sense metal deprivation in vivo and reveal the potential of metal-sensing reporters. The work adds a new dimension to studying how intracellular pathogens sense and respond to the changing environments of the host.",

We consider the optical and biophysical constraints particular to 1P and 2P voltage imaging and compare the imaging properties of commonly used GEVIs under 1P and 2P excitation. We measure brightness and voltage sensitivity of voltage indicators from commonly used classes under 1P and 2P illumination. We also measure the decrease in fluorescence as a function of depth in mouse brain. We develop a simple model of the number of measurable cells as a function of reporter properties, imaging parameters, and desired signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). We then discuss how the performance of voltage imaging would be affected by sensor improvements and by recently introduced advanced imaging modalities. Compared to 1P excitation, 2P excitation requires ~10<sup>4</sup>-fold more illumination power per cell to produce similar photon count rates. For voltage imaging with JEDI-2P in mouse cortex with a target SNR of 10 (spike height:baseline shot noise), a measurement bandwidth of 1 kHz, a thermally limited laser power of 200 mW, and an imaging depth of > 300 μm, 2P voltage imaging using an 80 MHz source can record from no more 12 cells simultaneously. Due to the stringent photon-count requirements of voltage imaging and the modest voltage sensitivity of existing reporters, 2P voltage imaging <i>in vivo</i> faces a stringent tradeoff between shot noise and tissue photodamage. 2P imaging of hundreds of neurons with high SNR at depth > 300 μm will require either major improvements in 2P GEVIs or qualitatively new approaches to imaging.",

Currently, TDM is primarily performed with ELISA techniques in clinical laboratories, resulting in a long sample-to-result workflow. Point-of-care (POC) detection of these therapeutic antibodies could significantly decrease turnaround times and allow for user-friendly home-testing. Here, we adapted the recently developed bioluminescent dRAPPID (dimeric Ratiometric Plug-and-Play Immunodiagnostics) sensor platform to allow POC TDM of infliximab and adalimumab. We applied the two best performing dRAPPID sensors, with limit-of-detections of 1 pM and 17 pM, to measure the infliximab and adalimumab levels in 49 and 40 patient serum samples, respectively. The analytical performance of dRAPPID was benchmarked with commercial ELISAs and yielded Pearson's correlation coefficients of 0.93 and 0.94 for infliximab and adalimumab, respectively. Furthermore, a dedicated bioluminescence reader was fabricated and used as a readout device for the TDM dRAPPID sensors. Subsequently, infliximab and adalimumab patient serum samples were measured with the TDM dRAPPID sensors and bioluminescence reader, yielding Pearson's correlation coefficients of 0.97 and 0.86 for infliximab and adalimumab, respectively, and small proportional differences with ELISA (slope was 0.97 ± 0.09 and 0.96 ± 0.20, respectively).

In this regard, spotting the sample and reference simultaneously and in close proximity compensates for the fluctuations. This \"dual-spot\" design is similar to the double-beam technique used in spectrophotometry, which reduces fluctuations in the results. The underlying hypothesis is that any instrumental and/or environmental factors influencing the color intensity in the detection zones will similarly impact the color intensity in the control zone under the same conditions. To test our design, a ratiometric microfluidic paper-based analytical device (μPAD), functionalized with a mixture of green-emissive carbon dots (CDs) and red-emissive ethidium bromide, was developed for the selective detection of ascorbic acid (AA). The green emission of the CDs is quenched by both AA and Fe<sup>3+</sup>; NaF was thus loaded onto the 3D connector as a masking agent to remove the interference effect of the Fe<sup>3+</sup> ions. The color variations were monitored under a UV lamp, using a smartphone to capture the images, and the RGB intensities were processed using the Color Grab application. The proposed double-spot method greatly enhanced the analytical precision and accuracy of the device. A linear working range from 0 to 125 μM was obtained, and the limit of detection was 2.71 μM. The μPAD was successfully used for the detection of AA in human serum, with recoveries from 87.27 to 98.52 %.",

Specifically, the mesolimbic pathway connecting the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and the nucleus accumbens (NAc) is crucial in regulating memory, emotion, motivation, and behavior due to its responsibility to modulate dopamine. To better investigate the relationship between DA and addiction, more advanced mapping methods are necessary to monitor its production and propagation accurately and efficiently. In this study, we incorporate dLight1.2 adeno-associated virus (AAV) into our latest CMOS (complementary metal-oxide semiconductor) imaging platform to investigate the effects of two pharmacological substances, morphine and cocaine, in the NAc using adult mice.

Our results suggest that changes in extracellular DA can be observed with this adapted system, showing potential for new applications and methods for approaching addiction studies.

TRPA1 expression has been primarily identified in subsets of nociceptive sensory afferents and is considered a target for future analgesics. Nevertheless, TRPA1 has been implicated in other cell types including keratinocytes, epithelium, enterochromaffin cells, endothelium, astrocytes, and CNS neurons. Here, we developed a knock-in mouse that expresses the recombinase Flp<sub>O</sub> in TRPA1-expressing cells. We crossed the <i>TRPA1<sup>Flp</sup></i> mouse with the <i>R26<sup>ai65f</sup></i> mouse that expresses tdTomato in a Flp-sensitive manner. We found tdTomato expression correlated well with TRPA1 mRNA expression and sensitivity to TRPA1 agonists in subsets of TRPV1 (transient receptor potential vanilloid receptor type 1)-expressing neurons in the vagal ganglia and dorsal root ganglia (DRGs), although tdTomato expression efficiency was limited in DRG. We observed tdTomato-expressing afferent fibers centrally (in the medulla and spinal cord) and peripherally in the esophagus, gut, airways, bladder, and skin. Furthermore, chemogenetic activation of TRPA1-expressing nerves in the paw evoked flinching behavior. tdTomato expression was very limited in other cell types. We found tdTomato in subepithelial cells in the gut mucosa but not in enterochromaffin cells. tdTomato was also observed in supporting cells within the cochlea, but not in hair cells. Lastly, tdTomato was occasionally observed in neurons in the somatomotor cortex and the piriform area, but not in astrocytes or vascular endothelium. Thus, this novel mouse strain may be useful for mapping and manipulating TRPA1-expressing cells and deciphering the role of TRPA1 in physiological and pathophysiological processes.",

Based on a previous mouse model, we have generated transgenic zebrafish in which expression of NanoLuciferase (NanoLuc) is controlled by the promoter of glial fibrillary acidic protein, leading to expression in zebrafish glia. To identify agents that disrupt the BBB, including inhibitors of ABCB1 and ABCG2, we identified NanoLuc substrates that are also transported by P-gp, ABCG2, and their zebrafish homologs. These substrates will elevate the amount of bioluminescent light produced in the transgenic zebrafish with BBB disruption. We transfected HEK293 cells with NanoLuc and either human ABCB1, ABCG2, or their zebrafish homologs Abcb4 or Abcg2a, respectively, and expressed at the zebrafish BBB. We evaluated the luminescence of ten NanoLuc substrates, then screened the eight brightest to determine which are most efficiently effluxed by the ABC transporters. We identified one substrate efficiently pumped out by ABCB1, two by Abcb4, six by ABCG2, and four by Abcg2a.

We found that glutamate inputs exhibit virtually all of the characteristics of RPE, rather than conveying a specific component of RPE computation such as reward or expectation. Notably, while glutamate inputs were transiently inhibited by reward omission, they were excited by aversive stimuli. Opioid analgesics altered dopamine negative responses to aversive stimuli toward more positive responses, while excitatory responses of glutamate inputs remained unchanged. Our findings uncover previously unknown synaptic mechanisms underlying RPE computations; dopamine responses are shaped by both synergistic and competitive interactions between glutamatergic and GABAergic inputs to dopamine neurons depending on valences, with competitive interactions playing a role in responses to aversive stimuli.",

In this study, we present evidence that Aqp1 generates strong diffusion-based magnetic resonance signals without adversely affecting cell viability or morphology in diverse cell lines derived from mice and humans. Our findings indicate that Aqp1 overexpression does not induce ER stress, which is frequently associated with heterologous expression of membrane proteins. Furthermore, we observed that Aqp1 expression had no detrimental effects on native biological activities, such as phagocytosis, immune response, insulin secretion, and tumor cell migration in the analyzed cell lines.

The viral transduction of GECIs is commonly used to target expression to specific brain regions, can be conveniently used with any mouse strain of interest without the need for prior crossing with a GECI mouse line and avoids potential hazards due to the chronic expression of GECIs during development. A key requirement for monitoring neuronal activity with an indicator is that the indicator itself minimally affects activity. Here, using common adeno-associated viral (AAV) transduction procedures, we describe spatially confined aberrant Ca<sup>2+</sup> micro-waves slowly travelling through the hippocampus following expression of GCaMP6, GCaMP7 or R-CaMP1.07 driven by the synapsin promoter with AAV-dependent gene transfer, in a titre-dependent fashion. Ca<sup>2+</sup> micro-waves developed in hippocampal CA1 and CA3, but not dentate gyrus (DG) nor neocortex, were typically first observed at 4 weeks after viral transduction, and persisted up to at least 8 weeks. The phenomenon was robust, observed across laboratories with various experimenters and setups. Our results indicate that aberrant hippocampal Ca<sup>2+</sup> micro-waves depend on the promoter and viral titre of the GECI, density of expression as well as the targeted brain region. We used an alternative viral transduction method of GCaMP which avoids this artifact. The results show that commonly used Ca<sup>2+</sup>-indicator AAV transduction procedures can produce artefactual Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses.

Intracellular signaling pathways, including those mediated by cAMP, are key for regulated alpha and beta cell hormone secretion. The 3D islet structure, while essential for coordinated islet function, presents experimental challenges for mechanistic studies of the intracellular signaling pathways in primary human islet cells. To overcome these challenges and limitations, this protocol describes an integrated live-cell imaging and microfluidic platform using primary human pseudoislets generated from donors without diabetes that resemble native islets in their morphology, composition, and function. These pseudoislets are size-controlled through the dispersion and reaggregation process of primary human islet cells. In the dispersed state, islet cell gene expression can be manipulated; for example, biosensors such as the genetically encoded cAMP biosensor, cADDis, can be introduced. Once formed, pseudoislets expressing a genetically encoded biosensor, in combination with confocal microscopy and a microperifusion platform, allow for the synchronous assessment of fluorescent biosensor dynamics and alpha and beta cell hormone secretory profiles to provide more insight into cellular processes and function.",

Conventional measurement of micronutrients is often complex, laboratory-based, and not suitable for monitoring their bioavailable concentration. To address this need, we developed a fluorescence based microbial whole-cell biosensing (MWCB) system encoding for a Cu<sup>2+</sup>-responsive protein capable of generating a signal upon binding to Cu<sup>2+</sup>. The sensing-reporting protein was designed by performing circular permutation on the green fluorescent protein (GFP) followed by insertion of a Cu<sup>2+</sup> binding motif into the structure of GFP. The design included insertion of several binding motifs and creating plasmids that encoded the corresponding sensing proteins. The signal generated by the sensing-reporting protein is directly proportional to the concentration of Cu<sup>2+</sup> in the sample. Evaluation of the resulting biosensing systems carrying these plasmids was performed prior to selection of the optimal fluorescence emitting Cu<sup>2+</sup>-binding protein. The resulting optimized biosensing system was encapsulated in polyacrylate-alginate beads and embedded in soil for detection of the analyte. Once exposed to the soil, the beads were interrogated to measure the fluorescence signal emitted by the sensing-reporting protein using a portable imaging device. The biosensor was optimized for detection of Cu<sup>2+</sup> in terms of selectivity, sensitivity, matrix effects, detection limits, and reproducibility in both liquid and soil matrices. The limit of detection (LoD) of the optimized encapsulated biosensor was calculated as 0.27 mg/L and 1.26 mg/kg of Cu<sup>2+</sup> for Cu<sup>2+</sup> in solution and soil, respectively.

Here, we developed bioluminescent reporter bacteriophages for viable Cs-specific, substrate-free, rapid detection by introducing luciferase and its corresponding substrate-providing enzyme complex into the virulent phage ΦC01. Although the reporter phage ΦC01_lux, constructed by replacing non-essential genes for phage infectivity with a luxCDABE reporter operon, produced bioluminescence upon Cs infection, the emitted signal was quickly decayed due to the superior bacteriolytic activity of ΦC01. By truncating the membrane pore-forming protein holin and thus limiting its function, the bacterial lysis was delayed and the resultant engineered reporter phage ΦC01_lux_Δhol could produce a more stable and reliable bioluminescent signal. Accordingly, ΦC01_lux_Δhol was able to detect at least an average of 2 CFU/ml of Cs artificially contaminated PIF and Sunsik and food contact surface models within a total of 7 h of assays, including 5 h of pre-enrichment for Cs amplification.

In this study, we performed a detailed assessment of the activity of locus coeruleus neurons and changes in noradrenergic transmission during acute hippocampal seizures evoked with perforant path stimulation, using state-of-the-art methodology. Action potentials of LC neurons, of which some were identified by means of optogenetics, were recorded in anesthetized rats using a multichannel high-density electrophysiology probe. The seizure-induced change in firing rate differed between LC neurons: 55% of neurons decreased in firing rate during seizures, while 28% increased their firing rate. Topographic analysis of multi-unit activity over the electrophysiology probe showed a topographic clustering of neurons that were inhibited or excited during seizures. Changes in hippocampal noradrenaline transmission during seizures were assessed using a fluorescent biosensor for noradrenaline, GRAB<sub>NE2m</sub>, in combination with fiber photometry, in both anesthetized and awake rats. Although our neuronal recordings indicated both inhibition and excitation of LC neurons during seizures, a consistent release of noradrenaline was observed.

Vectorization allows a scalable and computationally efficient solution to the credit assignment problem by tailoring instructive signals to individual neurons. Recent theoretical models have suggested that neural circuits could implement single-phase vectorized learning at the cellular level by processing feedforward and feedback information streams in separate dendritic compartments<sup>1-5</sup>. This presents a compelling, but untested, hypothesis for how cortical circuits could solve credit assignment in the brain. We leveraged a neurofeedback brain-computer interface (BCI) task with an experimenter-defined reward function to test for vectorized instructive signals in dendrites. We trained mice to modulate the activity of two spatially intermingled populations (4 or 5 neurons each) of layer 5 pyramidal neurons in the retrosplenial cortex to rotate a visual grating towards a target orientation while we recorded GCaMP activity from somas and corresponding distal apical dendrites. We observed that the relative magnitudes of somatic versus dendritic signals could be predicted using the activity of the surrounding network and contained information about task-related variables that could serve as instructive signals, including reward and error. The signs of these putative teaching signals both depended on the causal role of individual neurons in the task and predicted changes in overall activity over the course of learning. Furthermore, targeted optogenetic perturbation of these signals disrupted learning. These results provide the first biological evidence of a vectorized instructive signal in the brain, implemented via semi-independent computation in cortical dendrites, unveiling a potential mechanism for solving credit assignment in the brain.",

However, A. tumefaciens exhibit the capacity for gene transfer to a diverse array of species. Numerous microalgae species lack well-established methods for reliably integrating genes of interest into their nuclear genome. To harness the potential benefits of microalgal biotechnology, simple and efficient genome manipulation tools are crucial. Herein, an optimized AMT protocol is presented for the industrial microalgae species Chlorella vulgaris, utilizing the reporter green fluorescent protein (mGFP5) and the antibiotic resistance marker for Hygromycin B. Mutants are selected through plating on Tris-Acetate-Phosphate (TAP) media containing Hygromycin B and cefotaxime. Expression of mGFP5 is quantified via fluorescence after over ten generations of subculturing, indicating the stable transformation of the T-DNA cassette. This protocol allows for the reliable generation of multiple transgenic C. vulgaris colonies in under two weeks, employing the commercially available pCAMBIA1302 plant expression vector.",

        "abstract": "The estimation of whole stream metabolism, as determined by photosynthesis and respiration, is critical to our understanding of carbon cycling and carbon subsidies to aquatic food-webs. The mass development of aquatic plants is a worldwide problem for human activities and often occurs in regulated rivers, altering biodiversity and ecosystem functions. Hydropower plants supersaturate water with gases and prevent the use of common whole stream metabolism models to estimate ecosystem respiration. Here we used the inert noble gas argon to parse out biological from physical processes in stream metabolism calculations. We coupled the O<sub>2</sub>:Ar ratio determined by gas chromatography in grab samples with in-situ oxygen concentrations measured by an optode to estimate aquatic plant photosynthesis and ecosystem respiration during supersaturation events through a parsimonious approach. The results compared well with a more complicated two-station model based on O<sub>2</sub> mass balances in non-supersatured water, and with associated changes in dissolved CO<sub>2</sub> (or dissolved inorganic carbon). This new method provides an independent approach to evaluate alternative corrections of dissolved oxygen data (e.g. through the use of total dissolved gases) in long term studies. The use of photosynthesis-irradiance models allows the determination of light parameters such as the onset of light saturation or low light use efficiency, which could be used for inverse modelling. The use of the O<sub>2</sub>:Ar approach to correct for oversaturation may become more applicable with the emergence of portable mass inlet mass spectrometers (MIMS). Photosynthesis was modest (2.9-5.8 g O<sub>2</sub> m<sup>2</sup> day<sup>-1</sup>) compared to other rivers with submerged vegetation, likely indicating nutrient co-limitations (CO<sub>2</sub>, inorganic N and P). Respiration was very low (-2.1 to -3.9 g O<sub>2</sub> m<sup>2</sup> day<sup>-1</sup>) likely due to a lack of allochthonous carbon supply and sandy sediment.",

Little is known about how AI parenting practices influence the health behaviors of youth. The objective of this qualitative study was to explore how a group of AI parents of youths at risk of disease influenced their youth's health behaviors after a family intervention. A secondary objective was to understand the role of AI parents in supporting and sustaining health behavior change in their youths following the intervention. Semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted with AI parents (<i>n</i> = 11) and their young adolescents, 10-15 years old (<i>n</i> = 6). Parents reported facilitators to how they enacted healthy lifestyle behaviors, including family togetherness, routines, youth inclusion in cooking, and motivation due to a health condition in the family. Barriers to enacting healthy behaviors included a lack of time, a lack of access to health resources, negative role modeling, and the pervasiveness of screen media. Three major themes about the role of AI parenting emerged inductively from the interview data: \"Parenting in nontraditional families\", \"Living in the American grab-and-go culture\", and \"Being there and teaching responsibility\". The importance of culture in raising youths was emphasized. These findings inform strategies to promote long-term adherence to behavior changes within the intervention. This study contributes to public health conversations regarding approaches for AI youths and families, who are not well represented in previous health behavior research.",

Herein, we enrolled 40 dairy (Holstein) cows at the end of the lactation phase for dry-cow therapy: 20 were treated with IMM ceftiofur (Spectramast®DC) and a non-antibiotic internal teat sealant (bismuth subnitrate) and 20 (controls) received only bismuth subnitrate. Fecal grab samples were collected before and after treatment (weeks 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, and 9) for bacterial quantification and metagenomic next-generation sequencing. Overall, 90% and 24% of the 278 samples had Gram-negative bacteria with resistance to ampicillin and ceftiofur, respectively. Most of the cows treated with ceftiofur did not have an increase in the number of resistant bacteria; however, a subset (25%) shed higher levels of ceftiofur-resistant bacteria for up to 2 weeks post-treatment. At week 5, the antibiotic-treated cows had lower microbiota abundance and richness, whereas a greater abundance of genes encoding extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs), CfxA, ACI-1, and CMY, was observed at weeks 1, 5 and 9. Moreover, the contig and network analyses detected associations between β-lactam resistance genes and phages, mobile genetic elements, and specific genera. Commensal bacterial populations belonging to Bacteroidetes most commonly possessed ESBL genes followed by members of Enterobacteriaceae. This study highlights variable, persistent effects of IMM ceftiofur treatment on the gut microbiome and resistome in dairy cattle. Antibiotic-treated cattle had an increased abundance of specific taxa and genes encoding ESBL production that persisted for 9 weeks. Fecal shedding of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae, which was classified as a serious public health threat, varied across animals. Together, these findings highlight the need for additional studies aimed at identifying factors associated with shedding levels and the dissemination and persistence of antibiotic resistance determinants on dairy farms across geographic locations.",

Multiplexed imaging of live human cells coexpressing cyan, yellow and red ATOM sensors detected biosensor targets that were specifically localized to various subcellular compartments. Fluorescence activation involved ligand-dependent chromophore maturation with turn-on ratios of up to 62-fold in cells and 100-fold in vitro. Endoplasmic reticulum- and mitochondria-localized ATOM sensors detected ligands that were targeted to those organelles.

Dynamic visualization of histone modifications with genetically encoded fluorescent sensors makes it possible to monitor changes in the epigenetic state of a single living cell. At the same time, the sensors can potentially compete with endogenous factors recognizing these modifications. Thus, prolonged binding of the sensors to chromatin can affect normal epigenetic regulation. Here, we report an optogenetic sensor for live-cell visualization of histone H3 methylated at lysine-9 (H3K9me3) named MPP8-LAMS (MPP8-based light-activated modification sensor). MPP8-LAMS consists of several fusion protein parts (from N- to C-terminus): i) nuclear export signal (NES), ii) far-red fluorescent protein Katushka, iii) H3K9me3-binding reader domain of the human M phase phosphoprotein 8 (MPP8), iv) the light-responsive AsLOV2 domain, which exposes a nuclear localization signal (NLS) upon blue light stimulation. In the dark, due to the NES, MPP8-LAMS is localized in the cytosol. Under blue light illumination, MPP8-LAMS underwent an efficient translocation from cytosol to nucleus, enabling visualization of H3K9me3-enriched loci. Such an on-demand visualization minimizes potential impact on cell physiology as most of the time the sensor is separated from its target. In general, the present work extends the application of optogenetics to the area of advanced use of genetically encoded sensors.",

Human TSH levels display both pulsatile and (nonpulsatile) basal TSH secretion patterns; however, the importance of these in regulating thyroid function and their decoding by the thyroid is unknown. Here, we developed a novel ultra-sensitive ELISA that allows precise detection of TSH secretion patterns with minute resolution in mouse models of health and disease. We characterized the patterns of ultradian TSH pulses in healthy, freely behaving mice over the day-night cycle. Challenge of the thyroid axis with primary hypothyroidism because of iodine deficiency, a major cause of thyroid dysfunction worldwide, results in alterations of TSH pulsatility. Induction in mouse models of sequential TSH pulses that mimic ultradian TSH profiles in periods of minutes were more efficient than sustained rises in basal TSH levels at increasing both thyroid follicle cAMP levels, as monitored with a genetically encoded cAMP sensor, and circulating thyroid hormone. Hence, this mouse TSH assay provides a powerful tool to decipher how ultradian TSH pulses encode thyroid outcomes and to uncover hidden parameters in the TSH-thyroid hormone set-point in health and disease.",

Accordingly, local varieties were replaced by improved varieties, leading unfortunatley to a loss of the diversity of Beninese rice germplasm. The investigation focused on the structure and genetic diversity of 72 rice accessions collected throughout 22 villages using 13 quantitative traits and 17 SSR markers. The descriptive analysis of the 13 quantitative parameters showed a significant difference among the accessions, with a grouping in three clusters. Group I (16.66% of samples) was composed of accessions with long, wide and thick grains alongside with four controls TOG5681, TOG5307, Azucena and Moroberekan. Group II (7% of samples) contained accessions with late vegetative cycle. Group III contained most of the accessions (76.39% of the samples), including accessions such as the CG14 and Nipponbare control lines, and almost all the improved varieties. The molecular analysis revealed a significant diversity (mean number of alleles: 4.47 with polymorphism information content of 0.633). Population structure based on molecular markers showed three primary populations with a mixture of phenotypic groupings at ΔK, K = 3. This study showed that Beninese rice germplasm was divided into two structures: phenotypically similar cultivars but genotypically distinct (homonyms), and phenotypically different cultivars but genotypically similar (synonyms). Some local cultivars such Bagou19, Bagou20 and Koud44 can be used for large scale production due to their agronomics and molecular traits.

Households were visited 5 times over the course of a year. At each visit, information was collected on water management practices, and a sample of stored drinking water was collected for <i>E. coli</i> enumeration. Water quality was poor for households, with 80% having highly contaminated (>100 CFU per 100 mL) water during at least one visit. There was substantial variability of water quality for households, with only 3% of households having the same category (low, medium, or high) of water quality for all five visits.

While sufficient for many studies, the extent of genetic manipulation possible with a single recombinase site is limiting and insufficient for more complex cell-based assays. Here, we harnessed two orthogonal Bxb1 recombinase sites to enable alternative avenues for using mammalian synthetic biology to characterize transgenic protein variants. By designing plasmids flanked by a second pair of auxiliary recombination sites, we demonstrate that we can avoid the genomic integration of undesirable bacterial DNA elements using the same starting cells engineered for whole-plasmid integration. We also created \"double landing pad\" cells simultaneously harboring two orthogonal Bxb1 recombinase sites at separate genomic loci, allowing complex cell-based genetic assays. Integration of a genetically encoded calcium indicator allowed for the real-time monitoring of intracellular calcium signaling dynamics, including kinetic perturbations that occur upon overexpression of the wild-type or variant version of the calcium signaling relay protein STIM1. A panel of missense mutants of the HIV-1 accessory protein Vif was paired with various paralogs within the human Apobec3 innate immune protein family to identify combinations capable or incapable of interacting within cells.

An open question is the cellular location of ROS production and H3cit formation in lupus. In this study, we examined the effects of P140 peptides on ROS production and H3cit location in lupus with in vivo and situ fluorescence imaging with subcellular resolution. We developed a mouse model of the B6 strain harbouring a bioluminescent reporter under the control of the Lysozyme M promoter. Based on the imiquimod-induced disease model of B6 mice, we used bioluminescent imaging, flow cytometry analysis, and immunohistology staining to study the effects of P140 peptides in lupus. We found a profound accumulation of CX3CR1-positive macrophages in the lungs of lupus mice after the application of P140, accompanied by lung fibrosis formation. The defined P140-mediated macrophage responses were associated with an increase of H3cit in the cytosol, interleukin-1 receptor type 1 on the extracellular membrane, and intracellular production of ROS. Of interest, the disease of imiquimod-induced lupus was prevented with an antioxidant drug apocynin.

This is because in the broad density at lower resolution, critical features such as protein backbone carbonyl O atoms are not just less accurate but are not seen at all, and so peptide orientations are frequently wrongly fitted by 90-180°. This puts both backbone and side chains into the wrong local energy minimum, and they are then worsened rather than improved by further refinement into a valid but incorrect rotamer or Ramachandran region. On the positive side, new tools are being developed to locate this type of pernicious error in PDB depositions, such as CaBLAM, EMRinger, Pperp diagnosis of ribose puckers, and peptide flips in PDB-REDO, while interactive modeling in Coot or ISOLDE can help to fix many of them.

Although Se exposure occurs primarily via diet, considerable uncertainty lies in modeling Se transfer and bioaccumulation from sediment, detritus, and/or periphyton through benthic macroinvertebrates (BMI) to fish. Here we estimated Se concentrations in four coldwater fish species (northern pike, white sucker, lake whitefish, and ninespine stickleback) inhabiting boreal lakes downstream from a uranium mill in northern Canada. In addition, we evaluated the potential effects of BMI and periphyton sampling methods (artificial substrates vs. grab samples), seasons (summer vs. winter), and models (USEPA vs. Assessment of the Dispersion and Effects of Parameter Transport) on the estimated Se concentrations in fish tissue. Results were compared with site-specific benchmarks and observed Se concentrations in resident fish. In summer 2019, periphyton and BMI were sampled at 10 sampling stations (two in Vulture Lake and eight in McClean Lake) using artificial substrates (n = 4) and sediment grab samples (n = 3). In winter 2021, samples were collected in McClean Lake (n = 3) through ice holes using a sediment grab sampler. Estimated Se concentrations in fish tissue depended on the surface sediment or periphyton Se concentrations used in the models. At Vulture Lake, Se concentrations in northern pike muscle estimated using the grab sample data (17.3 ± 11.5 µg/g DW), but not the artificial substrates (34.5 ± 1.2 µg/g DW), were comparable with the observed mean concentration (19.0 ± 1.4 µg/g DW) in this species. At McClean Lake, Se body burdens in forage fish estimated using data from both sampling methods were comparable with measured data. Significantly lower mean whole-body Se concentrations were estimated for all fish species in winter (1.0 ± 0.3 µg/g DW) relative to summer (4.8 ± 1.6 µg/g DW).

We then performed linker truncations and screened a biosensor with ~1.5-fold fluorescence responses to tryptophan. Semi-rational design was conducted by focusing on the residues close to the chromophore or linkers, yielding a mutant with ~6-fold response. The GRIT sensor (Genetically encoded Ratiometric Indicator for Tryptophan) was obtained after screening ~8000 mutants in the linker saturated mutagenesis library. We also engineered a GRIT control sensor (GRITOL) without responses to tryptophan (Fig. 1a–c; Supplementary Fig. S1a–e).",

Motion distorts visual space, resulting in illusory position shifts such as flash-drag and flash-grab effects. The flash-grab displaces a test by up to several times its size. This lets us use it to investigate where the motion-induced shift operates in the processing stream from photoreceptor activation to feature activation to object recognition. We present several canonical, highly familiar forms and ask whether the motion-induced shift operates uniformly across the form. If it did, we could conclude that the effect occurred after the elements of the form are bound. However, we find that motion-induced distortion affects not only the position, but also the appearance of briefly presented, canonical shapes (square, circle, and letter T). Features of the flashed target that were closest to its center were shifted in the direction of motion more than those further from its center. Outline shapes were affected more than filled shapes, and the strength of the distortion increased with the contrast of the moving background. This not only supports a nonuniform spatial profile for the motion-induced shift but also indicates that the shift operates before the shape is established, even for highly familiar shapes like squares, circles, and letters.",

However, despite their central physiological role, our capacity to study or even engineer the permeation of distinct solutes across biological membranes remains rudimentary. This especially applies to Gram-negative bacteria, where the outer and inner membrane impose two permeation barriers. Addressing this analytical challenge, we exemplify how the permeability of the <i>Escherichia coli</i> cell envelope can be dissected using a small-molecule-responsive fluorescent protein sensor. The approach is exemplified for the biotechnologically relevant macrolide rapamycin, for which we first construct an intensiometric rapamycin detector (iRapTor) while comprehensively probing key design principles in the iRapTor scaffold. Specifically, this includes the scope of minimal copolymeric linkers as a function of topology and the concomitant need for gate post residues. In a subsequent step, we apply iRapTors to assess the permeability of the <i>E. coli</i> cell envelope to rapamycin. Despite its lipophilic character, rapamycin does not readily diffuse across the <i>E. coli</i> envelope but can be enhanced by recombinantly expressing a nanopore in the outer membrane. Our study thus provides a blueprint for studying and actuating the permeation of small molecules across the prokaryotic cell envelope.",

While estrogen feedback signals are determinant in triggering activation of GnRH neurons, through stimulation of afferent kisspeptin neurons in the rostral periventricular area of the third ventricle (RP3V<sup>KISS1</sup> neurons), many neuropeptidergic and classical neurotransmitter systems have been shown to regulate the LH surge. Among these, several lines of evidence indicate that the monoamine neurotransmitter serotonin (5-HT) has an excitatory, permissive, influence over the generation of the surge, <i>via</i> activation of type 2 5-HT (5-HT<sub>2</sub>) receptors. The mechanisms through which this occurs, however, are not well understood. We hypothesized that 5-HT exerts its influence on the surge by stimulating RP3V<sup>KISS1</sup> neurons in a 5-HT<sub>2</sub> receptor-dependent manner. We tested this using kisspeptin neuron-specific calcium imaging and electrophysiology in brain slices obtained from male and female mice. We show that exogenous 5-HT reversibly increases the activity of the majority of RP3V<sup>KISS1</sup> neurons. This effect is more prominent in females than in males, is likely mediated directly at RP3V<sup>KISS1</sup> neurons and requires activation of 5-HT<sub>2</sub> receptors. The functional impact of 5-HT on RP3V<sup>KISS1</sup> neurons, however, does not significantly vary during the estrous cycle. Taken together, these data suggest that 5-HT<sub>2</sub> receptor-mediated stimulation of RP3V<sup>KISS1</sup> neuron activity might be involved in mediating the influence of 5-HT on the preovulatory LH surge.",

Since hunger increases plasma ghrelin, we hypothesized that ghrelin receptor (GHSR) signalling on AgRP neurons is a key interoceptive mechanism integrating energy need with external sensory cues predicting caloric availability. We used in vivo photometry to measure the effects of ghrelin administration or fasting on AgRP neural activity with GCaMP6s and dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens with GRAB-DA in mice lacking ghrelin receptors in AgRP neurons. The deletion of GHSR on AgRP neurons prevented ghrelin-induced food intake, motivation and AgRP activity. The presentation of food (peanut butter pellet) or a wooden dowel suppressed AgRP activity in fasted WT but not mice lacking GHSRs in AgRP neurons. Similarly, peanut butter and a wooden dowel increased dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens after ip ghrelin injection in WT but not mice lacking GHSRs in AgRP neurons. No difference in dopamine release was observed in fasted mice. Finally, ip ghrelin administration did not directly increase dopamine neural activity in the ventral tegmental area. Our results suggest that AgRP GHSRs integrate an interoceptive state of energy need with external sensory information to produce an optimal change in AgRP neural activity. Thus, ghrelin signalling on AgRP neurons is more than just a feedback signal to increase AgRP activity during hunger.",

Reports of varying proportions of subtype marker expression have employed different dissection techniques to achieve wholemount muscularis preparations of myenteric plexus. In this study, we asked whether differences in GI dissection methods could introduce variability into the quantification of marker expression. We compared three commonly used methods of ENS wholemount dissection: two flat-sheet preparations that differed in the order of microdissection and fixation and a third rod-mounted peeling technique. We also tested a reversed orientation variation of flat-sheet peeling, two step-by-step variations of the rod peeling technique, and whole-gut fixation as a tube. We assessed marker expression using immunohistochemistry, genetic reporter lines, confocal microscopy, and automated image analysis. We found no significant differences between the two flat-sheet preparation methods in the expression of calretinin or neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) as a proportion of total neurons in ileum myenteric plexus. However, the rod-mounted peeling method resulted in decreased proportion of neurons labeled for both calretinin and nNOS. This method also resulted in decreased transgenic reporter fluorescent protein (tdTomato) for substance P in distal colon and choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) in both ileum and distal colon. These results suggest that labeling among some markers, both native protein and transgenic fluorescent reporters, is decreased by the rod-mounted mechanical method of peeling. The step-by-step variations of this method point to mechanical manipulation of the tissue as the likely cause of decreased labeling. Our study thereby demonstrates a critical variability in wholemount muscularis dissection methods.",

While regulated transport of a specific pool of cholesterol, known as \"accessible cholesterol\", contributes to the maintenance of cellular cholesterol distribution and homeostasis, tools to monitor accessible cholesterol in live cells remain limited. Here, we engineer a highly sensitive accessible cholesterol biosensor by taking advantage of the cholesterol-sensing element (the GRAM domain) of an evolutionarily conserved lipid transfer protein, GRAMD1b. Using this cholesterol biosensor, which we call GRAM-W, we successfully visualize in real time the distribution of accessible cholesterol in many different cell types, including human keratinocytes and iPSC-derived neurons, and show differential dependencies on cholesterol biosynthesis and uptake for maintaining levels of accessible cholesterol. Furthermore, we combine GRAM-W with a dimerization-dependent fluorescent protein (ddFP) and establish a strategy for the ultrasensitive detection of accessible plasma membrane cholesterol. These tools will allow us to obtain important insights into the molecular mechanisms by which the distribution of cellular cholesterol is regulated.",

Most youth gambling research focuses on illegal engagement with age-restricted products, but youth can also gamble legally, by for example betting with friends, or via coin pusher and crane grab machines. Research has associated recollected rates of usage of these machines as a child with adult gambling participation and problems, but only in the UK and Australia, and has not tested for robustness to subjective confidence. The present study conceptually replicated these prior studies by investigating the association between recollected childhood use of coin push and crane grab machines, and adult gambling behavior, in a young adult USA sample. Participants rated their subjective confidence to test if individual differences in recollection biases provided a better account for any observed associations. Results found high recollected engagement rates for both coin pusher (87.2%) and crane grab machines (97.0%), and 5 of the 6 tested associations between youth machine usage and adult gambling engagement and problems were significant and in the hypothesized direction. Rates of subjective confidence were on average high (83.3 and 89.2 on a 0 to 100 scale), and generally did not interact with participants' recollected rates of machine use. These findings extend prior research on potential public health concerns around children's legal engagement with coin pusher and crane grab machines to a new country, the USA.",

However, to maintain agronomical qualities of a given cultivar, the origin and quality of seeds are mandatory and at the heart of the maintenance of yield and of market requests. Following this idea, the objective of the current study was thus to investigate the genetic purity of IR841 varieties collected from rice producers across 22 villages in Benin in relation to their agronomical performances. For this, agromorphological evaluation of 72 accessions based on 13 quantitative descriptors followed by genotyping with the Illumina Infinium rice 7 K SNP array of 9 accessions was carried out in the presence of 2 controls. Agromorphologic as well as genetic and phylogenetic analyses revealed two groups, the first one Okouta97, Koum47, Nana30, Man118, Ang1 and control sample IR841-2) was characterized by seed accessions provided by the formal seed system, while the second (Koum53, Tchaka41 and Koud46) comprising seeds from local markets or from previous harvests and showing a depression in agronomic performances. We showed that IR841 seed purity is mandatory for the completion of agronomical performance, and that the farmers' choice of seeds must be guided and informed to ensure sustainability and food security.",

Studies of immediate-early genes indicate that BNST and CeA are acutely activated following alcohol drinking and may signal alcohol reward in nondependent drinkers, while increased stress signaling in the extended amygdala following chronic alcohol exposure drives increased drinking via negative reinforcement. However, the temporal dynamics of neuronal activation in these regions during drinking behavior are poorly understood. In this study, we used fiber photometry and the genetically encoded calcium sensor GCaMP6s to assess acute changes in neuronal activity during alcohol consumption in BNST and CeA before and after a chronic drinking paradigm. Activity was examined in the pan-neuronal population and separately in dynorphinergic neurons. BNST and CeA showed increased pan-neuronal activity during acute consumption of alcohol and other fluid tastants of positive and negative valence, as well as highly palatable chow. Responses were greatest during initial consummatory bouts and decreased in amplitude with repeated consumption of the same tastant, suggesting modulation by stimulus novelty. Dynorphin neurons showed similar consumption-associated calcium increases in both regions. Following three weeks of continuous alcohol access (CA), calcium increases in dynorphin neurons during drinking were maintained, but pan-neuronal activity and BNST-CeA coherence were altered in a sex-specific manner. These results indicate that BNST and CeA, and dynorphin neurons specifically, are engaged during drinking behavior, and activity dynamics are influenced by stimulus novelty and chronic alcohol.",

ANL superfamily enzymes undergo hinge-mediated ligand-coupling domain movement during catalysis. We introduce a circularly permuted fluorescent protein into enzymes hinges, converting ligand-induced conformational changes into significant fluorescence signal changes. We obtain 11 GECFINDERs for detecting phenylalanine, glutamic acid and other acids.

In the study, a variant of the red fluorescent protein was generated through random mutagenesis using the DsRed2 gene as a template. The process employed error-prone PCR (epPCR) to introduce random mutations, leading to the isolation of twelve gene variants. Among these, one variant stood out due to its unique spectral properties, exhibiting dual fluorescence emission at both 480 nm (green) and 550 nm (red). This novel variant was expressed in both Escherichia coli and zebrafish (Danio rerio) muscle, confirming the dual fluorescence emission in both model systems.

Ultratrace mercury is a potential threat to human health via the food chain. Here, we developed an ultrasensitive mercury WCB by directed evolution of the mercury-responsive transcriptional activator (MerR) sensing module to detect ultratrace mercury. Subsequently, the mutant WCB (m4-1) responding to mercury in the parts per trillion range after 1 h of induction was obtained. Its detection limit (LOD) was 0.313 ng/L, comparable to those of some analytical instruments. Surprisingly, the m4-1 WCB also responded to methylmercury (LOD = 98 ng/L), which is far more toxic than inorganic mercury. For more convenient detection, we have increased another green fluorescent protein reporter module with an optimized 5' untranslated region (5' UTR) sequence. This yields two visual WCBs with an enhanced fluorescence output. At a concentration of 2.5 ng/L, the fluorescence signals can be directly observed by the naked eye. With the combination of mobile phone imaging and image processing software, the 2GC WCB provided simple, rapid, and reliable quantitative and qualitative analysis of real samples (LOD = 0.307 ng/L). Taken together, these results indicate that the ultrasensitive visual whole-cell biosensors for ultratrace mercury detection are successfully designed using a combination of directed evolution and synthetic biotechnology.",

We found that in the optic tectum, RAs synchronize their Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients immediately after the end of an escape behavior. Using optogenetics, ablations, and a genetically encoded norepinephrine sensor, we observed that RA synchronous Ca<sup>2+</sup> events are mediated by the locus coeruleus (LC)-norepinephrine circuit. RA synchronization did not induce direct excitation or inhibition of tectal neurons. Nevertheless, it modulated the direction selectivity and the long-distance functional correlations among neurons.

Sediment core profiles and Pb-210 analyses showed historical enrichment of several trace elements in QC beginning after the commissioning of the power plant in 1948. When compared to upstream and downstream sites, species diversity was drastically reduced in Quantico Creek based on eDNA identification. Muscle tissues of banded killifish collected in Quantico Creek displayed increased Al, Cd, and Zn concentrations compared to upstream and downstream sites.

We used zebrafish as a model of infection for Aeromonas salmonicida subsp. salmonicida (hereinafter A. salmonicida), the causative agent of fish furunculosis. The infection process of A. salmonicida was studied by immersion of zebrafish larvae in 2 different doses of the bacteria and the fish mortality was monitored for three days. The bacterium caused a high mortality (65 %) in zebrafish larvae only when they were exposed to a high bacterial concentration (10<sup>7</sup> bacterial cells/mL). To evaluate the use of fluorescence microscopy to follow A. salmonicida infection in vivo, two different fluorescent strains generated by labeling an A. salmonicida strain with either, the green fluorescent protein (GFP), or with a previously reported siderophore amonabactin-sulforhodamine B conjugate (AMB-SRB), were used. The distribution of both labeled bacterial strains in the larvae tissues was evaluated by conventional and confocal fluorescence microscopy. The fluorescent signal showed a greater intensity with the GFP-labeled bacteria, so it could be observed using conventional fluorescence microscopy. Since the AMB-SRB labeled bacteria showed a weaker signal, the larvae were imaged using a laser scanning confocal microscope after 48 h of exposure to the bacteria. Both fluorescent signals were mainly observed in the larvae digestive tract, suggesting that this is the main colonization route of zebrafish for waterborne A. salmonicida. This is the first report of the use of a siderophore-fluorophore conjugate to study a bacterial infection in fish. The use of a siderophore-fluorophore conjugate has the advantage that it is a specific marker and that does not require genetic manipulation of the bacteria.",

Transgenes provide an avenue to visualize developmental events, cellular processes as well as real-time signal events in live animals using genetically encoded sensors. Generation of these tools has become increasingly efficient with the advent of numerous integration methods including transposon, CRISPR and recombinase-mediated integration. A growing limitation in transgene production is the assembly of the targeting constructs used to direct insertion of sequences into the genome. Here we present a toolkit that facilitates rapid assembly of complex reporters using a Golden Gate (GG) cloning-based approach. Co-assembly of one to eight DNA segments into an integration vector can be routinely obtained at high efficiency using a library of entry plasmids. The toolkit consists of 20 <i>SapI</i> GG entry vectors and 100 <i>SapI</i> GG insert plasmids containing a variety of promoters, FPs, tags, linkers, ORFs, 3' UTRs and numerous components for bipartite expression systems that can be mixed to create a huge repertoire of reporter constructs. The assembly process also works well with PCR products and 5' phosphorylated double stranded oligonucleotides, and such DNAs can be used to supply novel genes, promoters, and tags into the pipeline. In addition, the toolkit also provides a series of 12 empty <i>BsaI</i> -based GG assembly vectors that facilitate the construction of additional <i>SapI</i> GG plasmids containing novel inserts. A manual outlining the entire approach is provided as an appendix as well as a Microsoft® Excel based assembly tool which allows the user to choose individual inserts among the libraries of clones at each position in the assembly template and output an annotated sequence. The assembly process can easily be multiplexed and is typically over 90% efficient. The approach is sufficiently efficient to make microinjection rather than clone generation the limiting factor in transgene generation.",

Culture- and culture-independent (CIDT)-based methods were used to detect Salmonella in each sample. Salmonella isolated by culture-based methods were serotyped by Kauffman-White classification. Environmental data were collected for each sample. McNemar's χ<sup>2</sup> was used to determine if Salmonella detection differed by testing method. Separate mixed effect models were used to identify environmental factors associated with culture and CIDT-based Salmonella detection. Separate models were built for each pond, and for all ponds combined. Salmonella detection differed significantly (p < 0.001) between CIDT (31 %; 183/600)- and culture (13 %; 77/600)-based methods. Culture-based methods yielded 11 different serovars. All cultured Salmonella samples were confirmed by CIDT; 42.1 % of CIDT Salmonella-positive samples could be cultured. Associations between environmental factors and Salmonella detection also varied substantially by pond and detection method. In the all-pond model, associations were observed for five factors (total coliforms, Escherichia coli, air temperature, UV, rain) for both culture- and CIDT-based Salmonella detection. Rain prior to sampling (24 h) increased odds of Salmonella detection for culture (OR = 5.09) and CIDT (OR = 3.62) in the all-pond model. When all the pond data were used, models masked associations at the individual pond level, as there were noticeable differences between ponds and the odds of isolating Salmonella by environmental factors.

Approximately fifty chaperones from five major families were screened using live cell imaging to monitor FRET-positive tau seeding.

Knockdown experiments by shRNA revealed an inverse correlation between DnaJB1 and DnaJB6b with tau levels. DnaJB6b overexpression, specifically, reduced total tau levels in a cellular model with a pre-existing pool of tau, partially through enhanced proteasomal degradation. Further, DnaJB6b interacted with tau complexes. These findings highlight the potent chaperone activity within the DnaJ family, particularly DnaJB6b, towards tau.",

        "abstract": "Pressure-dependent chronotropy of murine lymphatic collecting vessels relies on the activation of the Ca2+-activated chloride channel encoded by Anoctamin 1 (Ano1) in lymphatic muscle cells. Genetic ablation or pharmacological inhibition of ANO1 results in a significant reduction in basal contraction frequency and essentially complete loss of pressure-dependent frequency modulation by decreasing the rate of the diastolic depolarization phase of the ionic pacemaker in lymphatic muscle cells (LMCs). Oscillating Ca2+ release from sarcoendoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ channels has been hypothesized to drive ANO1 activity during diastole, but the source of Ca2+ for ANO1 activation in smooth muscle remains unclear. Here, we investigated the role of the inositol triphosphate receptor 1 (Itpr1; Ip3r1) in this process using pressure myography, Ca2+ imaging, and membrane potential recordings in LMCs of ex vivo pressurized inguinal-axillary lymphatic vessels from control or Myh11CreERT2;Ip3r1fl/fl (Ip3r1ismKO) mice. Ip3r1ismKO vessels had significant reductions in contraction frequency and tone but an increased contraction amplitude. Membrane potential recordings from LMCs of Ip3r1ismKO vessels revealed a depressed diastolic depolarization rate and an elongation of the plateau phase of the action potential (AP). Ca2+ imaging of LMCs using the genetically encoded Ca2+ sensor GCaMP6f demonstrated an elongation of the Ca2+ flash associated with an AP-driven contraction. Critically, diastolic subcellular Ca2+ transients were absent in LMCs of Ip3r1ismKO mice, demonstrating the necessity of IP3R1 activity in controlling ANO1-mediated diastolic depolarization. These findings indicate a critical role for IP3R1 in lymphatic vessel pressure-dependent chronotropy and contractile regulation.",

The present regulatory toolboxes predominantly rely on the control and manipulation of carbon pathways. Nitrogen is an essential nutrient that plays a vital role in growth and metabolism. However, the availability of broadly applicable tools based on nitrogen pathways for metabolic regulation remains limited. In this work, we present a novel regulatory system that harnesses signals associated with nitrogen metabolism to redirect excess carbon flux in Bacillus licheniformis. By engineering the native transcription factor GlnR and incorporating a sorbitol-responsive element, we achieved a remarkable 99% inhibition of the expression of the green fluorescent protein reporter gene. Leveraging this system, we identified the optimal redirection point for the overflow carbon flux, resulting in a substantial 79.5% reduction in acetoin accumulation and a 2.6-fold increase in acetate production. This work highlight the significance of nitrogen metabolism in synthetic biology and its valuable contribution to metabolic engineering. Furthermore, our work paves the way for multidimensional metabolic regulation in future synthetic biology endeavors.",

Three shoe-wearing states, including bare feet, thin-soled shoes, and thick-soled shoes, with the eyes closed and open in each condition. Statistical analysis was performed, with the significance level set as 5%. In the multiple comparison results, the anteroposterior (AP) locus length, AP locus length per second, and maximum amplitude in the AP direction were significantly larger with thick-soled shoes than with bare feet in the closed eyes state. The locus length per unit area was significantly smaller with the thick-soled shoes than with the barefoot condition. Other items did not differ significantly between the shoe-wearing states. Thick-soled shoes caused a greater center of pressure movement in the AP direction in the static one-leg standing position than did the barefoot state. Our findings suggest that the condition with thick-soled shoes was more unstable in static environments.",

        "abstract": "Various stressors potentiate the rewarding effects of cocaine and contribute to cocaine cravings. However, it remains unclear whether psychosocial stress enhances the rewarding effects of cocaine. Accordingly, this study employed a cocaine-conditioned place preference (CPP) paradigm combined with social defeat (SD) exposure to investigate the effects of acute SD stress on cocaine reward in male mice. We found that SD stress immediately before the posttest significantly increased cocaine CPP, and systemic blockade of α<sub>1</sub> adrenoceptors, but not β adrenoceptors, suppressed this increase. Fiber photometry recordings with GRAB<sub>NE1m</sub> sensors revealed increased noradrenaline (NA) levels in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in test mice in response to attacks by aggressor mice during SD. Moreover, the SD stress-induced enhancement of CPP was effectively suppressed by intra-mPFC infusion of an α<sub>1</sub> adrenoceptor antagonist. In vitro whole-cell recordings demonstrated that silodosin, an α<sub>1A</sub>, but not α<sub>1B</sub> or α<sub>1D</sub>, adrenoceptor antagonist, inhibited NA-induced depolarizing currents and facilitation of excitatory synaptic transmissions. Consistently, intra-mPFC silodosin infusion significantly suppressed the SD stress-induced CPP enhancement. Conversely, intra-mPFC infusion of α<sub>1A</sub> adrenoceptor agonist augmented cocaine CPP in the absence of stress exposure. Additionally, intranasal silodosin administration attenuated the SD stress-induced enhancement of CPP, and chemogenetic inhibition of mPFC excitatory neurons also suppressed the SD stress-induced CPP enhancement. Together, these findings suggest that NA stimulation of α<sub>1A</sub> adrenoceptors and the subsequent activation of mPFC pyramidal cells may contribute to SD stress-induced amplification of the rewarding effects of cocaine, and intranasal silodosin administration may hold therapeutic potential for mitigating stress-associated cocaine craving.",

Sensitive detection of METTL3/14 complex is essential to tumor pathogenesis study, cancer diagnosis, and anti-cancer drug discovery. However, traditional methods for METTL3/14 complex assay suffer from poor specificity, costly antibodies, unstable RNA substrates, and low sensitivity. Herein, we construct a single quantum dot (QD)-based förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) biosensor for sensitive detection of METTL3/14 complex activity. In the presence of METTL3/14 complex, it catalyzes the methylation of adenine in the substrate probe, leading to the formation of m<sup>6</sup>A that protects the substrate probes from MazF-mediated cleavage. The hybridization of methylated DNA substrate with biotinylated capture probe initiates polymerization reaction to obtain a biotinylated double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) with the incorporation of numerous Cy5 fluorophores. Subsequently, the Cy5-incorporated dsDNA can self-assembly onto the 605QD surface to form the 605QD-dsDNA-Cy5 nanostructure, causing FRET between 605QD donor and Cy5 acceptor. This biosensor has excellent sensitivity with a limit of detection (LOD) of 3.11 × 10<sup>-17</sup> M, and it can measure the METTL3/14 complex activity in a single cell. Moreover, this biosensor can be used to evaluate the METTL3/14 complex kinetic parameters and screen potential inhibitors. Furthermore, it can differentiate the METTL3/14 complex expression in healthy human tissues and breast cancer patient tissues, providing a powerful tool for cancer pathogenesis study, clinical diagnosis, prognosis monitoring, and drug discovery.",

Inspired by biological structures, researchers have made enormous efforts in developing actuators that can respond to external stimuli, while such adhesive property is very desired, yet there is still limited research in responsive hydrogel actuators. Here, a bilayer actuator with high stretchability and robust interface bonding is presented, which has a smart adhesion and thermoreception function. The system consists of an adhesive passive layer copolymerized of amphoteric ([2-(methacryloyloxy) ethyl] dimethyl-(3-sulfopropyl), SBMA) and acrylic acid (AA), and an active layer hydrogel composed of poly(<i>N</i>-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAm) containing polydopamine-modified MXene (P-MXene) and calcium chloride (CaCl<sub>2</sub>). The coordination of carboxylate and Ca<sup>2+</sup> at the interface of the two layers enhances the interfacial bonding from 14 to 30 N m<sup>-1</sup>, which facilitates withstanding large strain and preventing stratification. The resulting hydrogel actuator can bend approximately 360° in a mere 10 s, exhibiting excellent photothermal effect, a large angle bending deformation, and ultrafast photoresponsive ability. As a proof of concept, the photothermal actuators are programmed to present various shapes and grab objects. Importantly, the hydrogel actuator exhibits remarkable adhesion capabilities toward diverse substrates, with a maximum peel force of up to 280 N m<sup>-1</sup>. Relying on their own adhesion and the photoresponse properties, these flexible adhesion actuators show outstanding gripping capability, enabling them to grip and release objects of different shapes and weights. More interestingly, the hydrogel exhibits a smart adjustable adhesion capability at different temperatures, which enables it as a gripper to recognize temperature signals through real-time different feedback actions based on its own adhesion. This study presents innovative insights into biomimetic hydrogel actuators, providing new opportunities for developing intelligent soft robots with multiple functions.",

The core-fibre parts of core-shell fibremats were made using a newly developed post-crosslinkable water-soluble copolymer, poly(2-hydroxypropyl methacrylamide)-<i>co</i>-poly(diacetone methacrylamide), and the bifunctional crosslinking agent, adipic dihydrazide, while the shell layer of the nanofibers was made of nylon 6. Upon encapsulating the lactate-sensor protein eLACCO1.1 at the core-fibre part, the fibremat exhibited a distinct concentration-dependent fluorescence response, with a dynamic range of fluorescence alteration exceeding 1000% over the lactate concentration range of 0 to 100 mM. The estimated dissociation constant from the titration data was comparable to that estimated in a buffer solution. The response remained stable even after 5 cycles and in the presence of proteases. These results indicates that our core-shell fibremat platform could serve as effective immobilizing substrates for various sensor proteins, facilitating continuous and quantitative monitoring of various low-molecular-weight metabolites and catabolites in a variety of biological samples.",

Here, we sought to examine the actions of extracellular ATP as a neurotransmitter and to investigate whether ATP and nicotinic signaling interact during adolescence. With the GRAB<sub>ATP</sub> (G-protein-coupled receptor activation-based ATP sensor), we first demonstrated that nicotine induces extracellular ATP release in the medial habenula, a brain region involved in nicotine aversion and withdrawal. Using patch-clamp electrophysiology, we then demonstrated that activation of the ATP receptors P2X or P2Y<sub>1</sub> increases the neuronal firing of cholinergic neurons. Surprisingly, contrasting interactive effects were observed with nicotine exposure. For the P2X receptor, activation had no observable effect on acute nicotine-mediated activity, but during abstinence after 10 d of nicotine exposure, coexposure to nicotine and the P2X agonist potentiated neuronal activity in female, but not male, neurons. For P2Y<sub>1</sub> signaling, a potentiated effect of the agonist and nicotine was observed with acute exposure, but not following extended nicotine exposure. These data reveal a complex interactive effect between nicotinic and ATP signaling in the adolescent brain and provide mechanistic insights into extracellular ATP signaling with sex-specific alterations of neuronal responses based on prior drug exposure.<b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> In these studies, it was discovered that nicotine induces extracellular ATP release in the medial habenula and subsequent activation of the ATP purinergic receptors increases habenular cholinergic neuronal firing in the adolescent brain. Interestingly, following extended nicotine exposure, nicotine was found to alter the interplay between purinergic and nicotinic signaling in a sex-specific manner. Together, these studies provide a novel understanding for the role of extracellular ATP in mediating habenular activity and reveal how nicotine exposure during adolescence alters these signaling mechanisms, which has important implications given the high incidence of e-cigarette/vape use by youth.",

Indeed, the <i>in vitro</i> neurodifferentiation of iPSCs, while recapitulating certain major stages of neurodevelopment <i>in vivo</i>, makes it possible to obtain networks of living human neurons. The culture model presented is particularly attractive within this framework since it involves iPSC-derived neural cells, which more specifically differentiate into cortical neurons of diverse types (in particular glutamatergic and GABAergic) and astrocytes. However, these <i>in vitro</i> neuronal networks, which may be heterogeneous in their degree of differentiation, remain challenging to bring to an appropriate level of maturation. It is therefore necessary to develop tools capable of analyzing a large number of cells to assess this maturation process. Calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) imaging, which has been extensively developed, undoubtedly offers an incredibly good approach, particularly in its versions using genetically encoded calcium indicators. However, in the context of these iPSC-derived neural cell cultures, there is a lack of studies that propose Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging methods that can finely characterize the evolution of neuronal maturation during the neurodifferentiation process. In this study, we propose a robust and reliable method for specifically measuring neuronal activity at two different time points of the neurodifferentiation process in such human neural cultures. To this end, we have developed a specific Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal analysis procedure and tested a series of different AAV serotypes to obtain expression levels of GCaMP6f under the control of the neuron-specific human synapsin1 (hSyn) promoter. The retro serotype has been found to be the most efficient in driving the expression of the GCaMP6f and is compatible with multi-time point neuronal Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging in our human iPSC-derived neural cultures. An AAV2/retro carrying GCaMP6f under the hSyn promoter (AAV2/retro-hSyn-GCaMP6f) is an efficient vector that we have identified. To establish the method, calcium measurements were carried out at two time points in the neurodifferentiation process with both hSyn and CAG promoters, the latter being known to provide high transient gene expression across various cell types. Our results stress that this methodology involving AAV2/retro-hSyn-GCaMP6f is suitable for specifically measuring neuronal calcium activities over multiple time points and is compatible with the neurodifferentiation process in our mixed human neural cultures.",

Despite this connectivity, little is known regarding the functionality of A13-DA circuits. Using TH-specific loss-of-function methodology and techniques to monitor population activity in transgenic rats in vivo, we investigated the contribution of A13-DA neurons in reward and movement-related actions. Our work demonstrates a role for A13-DA neurons in grasping and handling of objects but not reward. A13-DA neurons responded strongly when animals grab and manipulate food items, whereas their inactivation or degeneration prevented animals from successfully doing so-a deficit partially attributed to a reduction in grip strength. By contrast, there was no relation between A13-DA activity and food-seeking behavior when animals were tested on a reward-based task that did not include a reaching/grasping response. Motivation for food was unaffected, as goal-directed behavior for food items was in general intact following A13 neuronal inactivation/degeneration. An anatomical investigation confirmed that A13-DA neurons project to the superior colliculus (SC) and also demonstrated a novel A13-DA projection to the reticular formation (RF). These results establish a functional role for A13-DA neurons in prehensile actions that are uncoupled from the motivational factors that contribute to the initiation of forelimb movements and help position A13-DA circuits into the functional framework regarding centrally located DA populations and their ability to coordinate movement.",

Here, we report a bilateral actuator with a bilateral deformation function similar to that of a muscle group that can be used for soft robots. To construct this bilateral actuator, a low-cost VHB 4910 dielectric elastomer was selected as the artificial muscle, and polymer films manufactured with specific shapes served as the actuator frame. By end-to-end connecting these bilateral actuators, a gear-shaped 3D soft robot with diverse motion capabilities could be developed, benefiting from adjustable actuation combinations. Lying on the ground with all feet on the ground, a crawling soft robot with dexterous movement along multiple directions was realized. Moreover, the directional steering was instantaneous and efficient. With two feet standing on the ground, it also acted as a rolling soft robot that can achieve bidirectional rolling motion and climbing motion on a 2° slope. Finally, inspired by the orbicularis oris muscle in the mouth, a mouthlike soft robot that could bite and grab objects 5.3 times of its body weight was demonstrated. The bidirectional function of a single actuator and the various combination modes among multiple actuators together allow the soft robots to exhibit diverse functionalities and flexibility, which provides a very valuable reference for the design of highly controllable soft robots.",

For this purpose, we first prepared PGE<sub>2</sub>-producer cells that express either an optogenetic or a chemogenetic calcium channel stimulator: OptoSTIM1 or Gq-DREADD, respectively. Second, we prepared reporter cells expressing the Gs-coupled PGE<sub>2</sub> reporter EP2 and the PKA biosensor Booster-PKA, which is based on the principle of Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET). Upon the stimulation-induced triggering of calcium transients, a single producer cell discharges PGE<sub>2</sub> to stimulate PKA in the surrounding reporter cells. Due to the flow of the medium, the PKA-activated area exhibited a comet-like smear when HeLa cells were used. In contrast, radial PKA activation was observed when confluent MDCK cells were used, indicating that PGE<sub>2</sub> diffusion was restricted to the basolateral space. By fitting the radius of the PKA-activated area to a simulation model based on simple diffusion, we estimated that a single HeLa cell secretes 0.25 fmol PGE<sub>2</sub> upon a single calcium transient to activate PKA in more than 1000 neighboring cells. This model also predicts that the PGE<sub>2</sub> discharge rate is comparable to the diffusion rate.

Therefore, an attempt has been made to study the trend of annual maximum series (AMS) discharges and flood frequency in the Lower Mekong Basin (LMB). The AMS data of five stations in the LMB were procured from the Mekong River Commission for analyses of trends of the AMS and flood frequency. The Mann-Kendall test showed a significant decrease in the magnitude of annual peak floods for all the discharge gauging sites in the LMB. Likewise, the analysis of the annual discharge departure from the mean reveals noteworthy variations and departure (positive and negative) in the annual peak discharges. The goodness-of-fit (GoF) tests showed that Log-Pearson Type-III (LP-III) is the best distribution for AMS of the Mekong River than Gumbel Extreme Value Type-I (GEVI). Therefore, predicted discharges for different return periods and predicted recurrence intervals for average annual discharges (<i>Q</i><sub><i>m</i></sub>), large floods (<i>Q</i><sub><i>lf</i></sub>), and maximum annual peak discharge during the recording period (<i>Q</i><sub>max</sub>) by LP-III are trustworthy. The flood frequency curve specified that all the observed discharges were fairly on the best-fitted line and falls between upper and lower confidence limits. Inclusively, the results of the trend in annual peak discharges and flood frequency are consistent and can be used for water management, controlling flood disasters, and flood planning in the LMB.",

Typical cancer cell-based culture only allows robust exploration of asexual cycle and sexual differentiation of <i>Cryptosporidium</i>. To facilitate exploration of sexual reproduction in <i>C. parvum</i> we developed an organoid-based culture system that supports <i>Cryptosporidium's</i> full life cycle and a novel fertilization reporter. Organoid derived monolayers (ODMs) supported fertilization and oocyst production and maintained the infection for up to 3 weeks. ODM derived oocysts were infectious <i>in vivo</i>. Fertilization was confirmed by successfully mating two strains of <i>C. parvum</i> and with a novel fertilization switch reporter. The fertilization switch reporter utilizes a DiCre system in which cre fragments are expressed under the control of sexual stage promoters resulting in a rapamycin-inducible switch in fluorescent protein expression from mCherry to mNeonGreen after fertilization that is spatially and temporally controlled. This results in mCherry positive parasites in the first generation and offspring that express mNeonGreen. <i>In vivo</i> validation of the fertilization switch reporter demonstrated the precision and efficiency of the fertilization switch reporter and confirmed excision of the mCherry gene sequence only after rapamycin treatment. The start of a second generation of parasites was also shown in the ODMs and rarely in HCT8s.

Whether these fetal cells are beneficial or detrimental to maternal health is unknown. This study aimed to characterize fetal microchimeric immune cells in the maternal heart during pregnancy and postpartum, and to identify differences in these fetal microchimeric subpopulations between normal and pregnancies complicated by spontaneous preterm induced by ascending infection. <b>Methods:</b> A Cre reporter mouse model, which when mated with wild-type C57BL/6J females resulted in cells and tissues of progeny expressing red fluorescent protein tandem dimer Tomato (mT+), was used to detect fetal microchimeric cells. On embryonic day (E)15, 10<sup>4</sup> colony-forming units (CFU) <i>E. coli</i> was administered intravaginally to mimic ascending infection, with delivery on or before E18.5 considered as preterm delivery. A subset of pregnant mice was sacrificed at E16 and postpartum day 28 to harvest maternal hearts. Heart tissues were processed for immunofluorescence microscopy and high-dimensional mass cytometry by time-of-flight (CyTOF) using an antibody panel of immune cell markers. Changes in cardiac physiologic parameters were measured up to 60 days postpartum via two-dimensional echocardiography. <b>Results:</b> Intravaginal <i>E. coli</i> administration resulted in preterm delivery of live pups in 70% of the cases. mT + expressing cells were detected in maternal uterus and heart, implying that fetal cells can migrate to different maternal compartments. During ascending infection, more fetal antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and less fetal hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and fetal double-positive (DP) thymocytes were observed in maternal hearts at E16 compared to normal pregnancy. These HSCs were cleared while DP thymocytes persisted 28 days postpartum following an ascending infection. No significant changes in cardiac physiologic parameters were observed postpartum except a trend in lowering the ejection fraction rate in preterm delivered mothers. <b>Conclusion:</b> Both normal pregnancy and ascending infection revealed distinct compositions of fetal microchimeric immune cells within the maternal heart, which could potentially influence the maternal cardiac microenvironment via (1) modulation of cardiac reverse modeling processes by fetal stem cells, and (2) differential responses to recognition of fetal APCs by maternal T cells.",

The promoter sequence of human <i>COL1A1</i> was amplified from the genomic DNA of human hepatocarcinoma cell line HepG2. Based on the pLVX-AcGFP1-N1 plasmid, the recombinant plasmid pLVX-COL1A1-enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) was constructed, in which the enhanced green fluorescent protein gene expression was regulated by the <i>COL1A1</i> promoter. The monoclonal cell line was acquired by stably transfecting pLVX-COL1A1-EGFP into the immortalized human hepatic stellate cell line LX-2 by the lentivirus packaging system and screening. The cell line was treated with transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) or co-treated with TGF-β1 and drugs with potential anti-hepatic fibrosis effects. The EGFP fluorescence intensity in cells was analyzed by the fluorescence microscope and ImageJ 1.49 software using a semi-quantitative method. The <i>COL1A1</i> and <i>EGFP</i> mRNA were detected by reverse transcription real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), and corresponding proteins were detected by Western blot. The recombinant plasmid pLVX-COL1A1-EGFP with the expression of <i>EGFP</i> regulated by <i>COL1A1</i> promoter was successfully constructed. Kozak sequence was added to enhance the expression of <i>EGFP</i>, which was identified by double digestion and sequencing.

Alternatively, therapies can be based on tissue engineering, for which degradable in vitro cell growth substrates are used to culture replacement parts. In both cases, materials are desirable that imitate the biophysical properties of vessels, including their tubular shapes and compliance. This work contributes to these demands by offering methods for the manufacturing of anisotropic 3D-printed nanofibrous tubular structures that have similar biophysical properties as porcine aortae, that are biocompatible, and that allow for controlled nutrient diffusion. Tubes of various sizes with axial, radial, or alternating nanofiber orientation along the blood flow direction are manufactured by a customized method.

Our study tests if boot cover sampling results reflect quality and safety indicator organisms and community diversity of grab sampling. We collected soil samples from commercial romaine lettuce fields spanning 5060 m<sup>2</sup> using boot covers (n = 28, m = 1.1 ± 0.4 g; wearing boot covers and walking along the path), composite grabs (n = 28, m = 231 ± 24 g; consisting of 60 grabs of 3-5 g each), and high-resolution grabs (n = 72, m = 56 ± 4 g; taking one sample per stratum). Means and standard deviations of log-transformed aerobic plate counts (APCs) were 7.0 ± 0.3, 7.1 ± 0.2, and 7.3 ± 0.2 log(CFU/g) for boot covers, composite grabs, and high-resolution grabs, respectively. APCs did not show biologically meaningful differences between sample types. Boot covers recovered on average 0.6 log(CFU/g) more total coliforms than both grabs (p < 0.001) where means and standard deviations of log-transformed counts were 3.2 ± 1.0, 2.6 ± 0.6, and 2.6 ± 1.0 log(CFU/g) for boot covers, composite grabs, and high-resolution grabs, respectively. There were no generic E. coli detected in any sample by enumeration methods with LODs of 1.3-2.1 log(CFU/g) for boot covers and 0.5 log(CFU/g) for both grabs. By 16S rRNA sequencing, community species diversity (alpha diversity) was not significantly different within collection methods. While communities differed (p < 0.001) between soil sampling methods (beta diversity), variance in microbial communities was not significantly different. Of the 28 phyla and 297 genera detected, 25 phyla (89%) and 258 genera (87%) were found by all methods.

Here, we selected five drosophilid species, including Drosophila melanogaster, inhabiting different ecological niches to compare their olfactory systems at multiple levels. We first identified ecologically relevant natural food odorants from every species and established species-specific odorant preferences. To compare odor coding in sensory neurons, we analyzed the antennal lobe (AL) structure, generated glomerular atlases, and developed GCaMP transgenic lines for all species. Although subsets of glomeruli showed distinct tuning profiles, odorants inducing species-specific preferences were coded generally similarly. Species distantly related or occupying different habitats showed more evident differences in odor coding, and further analysis revealed that changes in olfactory receptor (OR) sequences partially explain these differences. Our results demonstrate that genetic distance in phylogeny and ecological niche occupancy are key determinants in the evolution of ORs, AL structures, odor coding, and behavior. Interestingly, changes in odor coding among species could not be explained by evolutionary changes at a single olfactory processing level but rather are a complex phenomenon based on changes at multiple levels.",

Nevertheless, poultry mRNA vaccination could prove to be very interesting due to the relatively low production cost, especially true when using self-amplifying mRNA (saRNA), and their extreme adaptability to new pathogens. The latter could be particularly useful when new pathogens join the stage or new variants arise. As a first step toward the investigation of saRNA vaccines in poultry, this study evaluates a luciferase-encoding saRNA in avian tracheal explants, conjunctival explants, primary chicken cecal cells and 18-day embryonated eggs. Naked saRNA in combination with RNase inhibitor and 2 different lipid-based formulations, that is, ionizable lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) and Lipofectamine Messenger Max, were evaluated. The saRNA-LNP formulation led to the highest bioluminescent signal in the tracheal explants, conjunctival explants and cecal cell cultures. A dose-response experiment with these saRNA-LNPs (33-900 ng/well) in these avian organoids and cells showed a nonlinear dose-response relationship. After in ovo administration, the highest dose of the saRNA-LNPs (5 µg) resulted in a visual expression as a weak bioluminescence signal could be seen. The other delivery approaches did not lead to a visual saRNA expression in the embryos. In conclusion, effective entry of saRNA encapsulated in LNPs followed by successful saRNA translation in poultry was established.

This study assessed how summer meal site characteristics and geographically targeted outreach methods were associated with summer meals served in 2021 in Connecticut. Weekly meal count data were requested from all sponsors of the Summer Food Service Program and the National School Lunch Program Seamless Summer Option. Data were received from 78 sponsors with 763 sites. Geographically targeted outreach (e.g., billboards, bus ads, and flyers) was tracked by location each week. Mixed methods ANOVA was used to examine the predictive value of outreach efforts, program characteristics, and meal distribution methods on meals served each week. The program characteristics examined included the hours open per week, the number of weeks serving meals, the maximum number of meals distributed at one time, and the number of open and closed sites in a school district. Between June 21 and August 20, 2021, a total of 1,188,669 breakfasts and 1,389,347 lunches were served.

The outreach efforts assessed were not significantly associated with changes in meal distribution at nearby sites. The U.S. Department of Agriculture's waivers in response to COVID-19 permitted extended operating hours and multiple-meal distribution.

        "abstract": "Increased brain levels of acetylcholine (ACh) are observed in subsets of patients with depression and increasing ACh levels chronically can precipitate stress-related behaviors in humans and animals. Conversely, optimal ACh levels are required for cognition and memory. We hypothesize that ACh signaling is important for encoding both appetitive and stress-relevant memories, but that excessive increases in ACh result in a negative encoding bias in which memory formation of a stressful event is aberrantly strengthened, potentially contributing to the excessive focus on negative experience that could lead to depressive symptoms. The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is critical to control the limbic system to filter exteroceptive cues and stress-related circuits. We therefore evaluated the role of ACh signaling in the mPFC in a learned helplessness task in which mice were exposed to repeated inescapable stressors followed by an active avoidance task. Using fiber photometry with a genetically-encoded ACh sensor, we found that ACh levels in the mPFC during exposure to inescapable stressors were positively correlated with later escape deficits in an active avoidance test in males, but not females. Consistent with these measurements, we found that both pharmacologically- and chemogenetically-induced increases in mPFC ACh levels resulted in escape deficits in both male and female mice, whereas chemogenetic inhibition of ACh neurons projecting to the mPFC improved escape performance in males, but impaired escape performance in females. These results highlight the adaptive role of ACh release in stress response, but also support the idea that sustained elevated ACh levels contribute to maladaptive behaviors. Furthermore, mPFC ACh signaling may contribute to depressive symptomology differentially in males and females.",

        "abstract": "Cyanobacteria show an unusually complex prokaryotic cell structure including a distinct intracytoplasmic membrane system, the thylakoid membranes that are the site of the photosynthetic light reactions. The thylakoid and plasma membranes have sharply distinct proteomes, but the mechanisms that target proteins to a specific membrane remain poorly understood. Here, we investigate the locations of translation of thylakoid and plasma membrane proteins in the model unicellular cyanobacterium <i>Synechococcus elongatus</i> PCC 7942. We use fluorescent <i>in situ</i> hybridization to probe the locations of mRNAs encoding membrane-integral proteins, plus Green Fluorescent Protein tagging of the RplL subunit to reveal the location of ribosomes under different conditions. We show that membrane-integral thylakoid and plasma membrane proteins are translated in different locations. Thylakoid membrane proteins are translated in patches at the innermost thylakoid membrane surface facing the nucleoid. However, different proteins are translated in different patches, even when they are subunits of the same multiprotein complex. This implies that translation is distributed over the proximal thylakoid surface, with newly inserted proteins migrating within the membrane prior to incorporation into complexes. mRNAs encoding plasma membrane proteins form patches at the plasma membrane. Ribosomes can be observed at similar locations near the thylakoid and plasma membranes, with more ribosomes near the plasma membrane when conditions force rapid production of plasma membrane proteins. There must be routes for ribosomes and mRNAs past the thylakoids to the plasma membrane. We infer a system to chaperone plasma membrane mRNAs to prevent their translation prior to arrival at the correct membrane. IMPORTANCE Cyanobacteria have a complex and distinct membrane system within the cytoplasm, the thylakoid membranes that house the photosynthetic light reactions. The thylakoid and plasma membranes contain distinct sets of proteins, but the steps that target proteins to the two membranes remain unclear. Knowledge of the protein sorting rules will be crucial for the biotechnological re-engineering of cyanobacterial cells, and for understanding the evolutionary development of the thylakoids. Here, we probe the subcellular locations of the mRNAs that encode cyanobacterial membrane proteins and the ribosomes that translate them. We show that thylakoid and plasma membrane proteins are produced at different locations, providing the first direct evidence for a sorting mechanism that operates prior to protein translation.",

        "abstract": "Maternal care is crucial for the survival and development of offspring. Oxytocin modulates maternal behavior by binding to oxytocin receptors (OXTRs) in various parts of the brain. Previously, we showed that OXTRs are expressed in the anteroventral periventricular nucleus (AVPV) of female, but not male mice. Because the AVPV is involved in the regulation of maternal behavior and oxytocin enhances its induction, this finding leads to the hypothesis that the female specific population of OXTR neurons in the AVPV regulates maternal behavior. To address this hypothesis, OXTR-Venus reporter mice were used to assess if expression levels of OXTR in the AVPV are changed during the postpartum period. The total number of OXTR-Venus neurons was significantly greater in postpartum dams compared to virgin females. To assess efferent projections of the AVPV-OXTR neurons, a Cre-dependent fluorescent protein (tdTomato) expressing a viral vector was injected into one side of the AVPV of female OXTR-Cre mice. Fibers expressing tdTomato were found in hypothalamic areas containing oxytocin neurons (the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei) and the midbrain areas (the ventral tegmental area and periaqueductal gray) that are involved in the regulation of maternal motivation. To assess if activity of the AVPV-OXTR neurons is involved in the regulation of maternal behaviors, a chemogenetic approach was employed. Specific inhibition of activity of AVPV-OXTR neurons completely abolished pup retrieval and nest building behaviors. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that AVPV-OXTR neurons in postpartum female mice constitute an important node in the neural circuitry that regulates maternal behavior.",

        "abstract": "Autophagy play contradictory roles in cellular transformation. We previously found that the knockout (KO) of autophagy-related 5 (Atg5), which is essential for autophagy, leads to the malignant transformation of NIH 3T3 cells. In this study, we explored the mechanism by which autophagy contributes to this malignant transformation using two transformed cell lines, Atg5 KO and Ras-NIH 3T3. Monomeric red fluorescent protein-green fluorescent protein-light chain 3 reporter and Cyto-ID staining revealed that Ras-NIH 3T3 cells exhibited higher basal autophagy activity than NIH 3T3 cells. Additionally, transformed cells, regardless of their Atg5 KO status, were more sensitive to autophagy inhibitors (SBI-0206965, chloroquine, and obatoclax) than the untransformed NIH 3T3 cells, suggesting that the transformed cells are more autophagy-dependent than the normal cells. Loss of Atg5 improved the cell viability and mobility, especially in Ras-NIH 3T3 cells. Furthermore, we discovered that autophagy was alternatively induced in a Rab9-dependent manner in Ras-NIH 3T3 and NIH 3T3/Atg5 KO cells. In particular, Atg5 KO cells showed reduced mTOR-mediated phosphorylation of Akt (pAkt S473), indicating the mTOR-independent occurrence of alternative autophagy in Atg5 KO cells. Therefore, our study provides evidence that alternative autophagy may contribute to tumorigenesis in cells with an impaired Atg5-dependent autophagy pathway.

Here, recombinants based on CV-A5-M14-611 were constructed carrying three reporter genes in different lengths. Smaller fluorescent marker proteins, light, oxygen, voltage sensing (iLOV), and nano luciferase (Nluc) were proven to be able to express efficiently in vitro. However, the recombinant with the largest insertion of the red fluorescence protein gene (DsRed) was not rescued. The construction strategy of reporter viruses was to insert the foreign genes between the C-terminus of VP1 and the N-terminus of 2A genes and to add a 2A protease cleavage domain at both ends of the insertions. The iLOV-tagged or Nluc-tagged recombinants, CV-A5-iLOV or CV-A5-Nluc, exhibited a high capacity for viral replication, genetic stability in cells and pathogenicity in mice. They were used to establish a rapid, inexpensive and convenient neutralizing antibody assay and greatly facilitated virus neutralizing antibody titration. Living imaging was performed on mice with CV-A5-Nluc, which exhibited specific bioluminescence in virus-disseminated organs, while fluorescence induced by CV-A5-iLOV was weakly detected.

The results suggested that the cspD promoter (P<sub>cspD</sub>) directed robust vfp expression at 60°C in G. kaustophilus. Although cspD potentially encodes a cold-shock protein, P<sub>cspD</sub> functioned at elevated temperatures. The promoter strongly functioned even in Escherichia coli; this prevented the cloning of some genes (e.g., vfp) downstream of it on a plasmid vector via E. coli-based genetic manipulation. Consequently, we generated a mutated P<sub>cspD</sub> that functioned inefficiently in E. coli and constructed the pGKE124 plasmid using the mutant promoter. The plasmid could carry vfp in E. coli and afford the production of VFP in G. kaustophilus at a yield of 390 mg/L. pGKE124 directed a similar production in other thermophilic species; the highest yield was observed in Geobacillus thermodenitrificans K1041. Several proteins could be produced using a system involving G. thermodenitrificans K1041 and pGKE124.

The activation of Cytc is composed of several steps, including its transfer to the mitochondrial membrane, binding to cytochrome c heme lyase (CCHL) and covalent attachment to heme. The spectroscopic methods are often applied to study the structural changes of Cytc. However, they require the isolation of Cytc from cells and have limited availability under physiological conditions. Despite recent studies to elucidate the tightly regulated folding mechanism of Cytc, the role of these events and their association with different conformational states remain elusive. Here, we provide a genetically encoded fluorescence method that allows monitoring of the conformational changes of Cytc upon binding to heme and CCHL. Cerulean and Venus fluorescent proteins attached at the N and C terminals of Cytc can be used to determine its unfolded, intermediate, and native states by measuring FRET amplitude. We found that the noncovalent interaction of heme in the absence of CCHL induced a shift in the FRET signal, indicating the formation of a partially folded state. The higher concentration of heme and coexpression of CCHL gave rise to the recovery of Cytc native structure. We also found that Cytc was weakly associated with CCHL in the absence of heme. As a result, a FRET-based fluorescence approach was demonstrated to elucidate the mechanism of heme-induced Cytc conformational changes with spatiotemporal resolution and can be applied to study its interaction with small molecules and other protein partners in living cells.",

To identify drugs with potential to treat FSGS, we used a specific zebrafish screening strain to combine a high-content screening (HCS) approach with an in vivo model. This zebrafish screening strain expresses nitroreductase and the red fluorescent protein mCherry exclusively in podocytes (providing an indicator for podocyte depletion), as well as a circulating 78 kDa vitamin D-binding enhanced green fluorescent protein fusion protein (as a readout for proteinuria). To produce FSGS-like lesions in the zebrafish, we added 80 µ M metronidazole into the fish water.

As an example, the infectivity of the SARS-CoV-2 Delta (B.1.617.2) and the Omicron (B.1.1.529) variants are quantified, and their sensitivities to a neutralizing antibody (27VB) are also measured. These examples demonstrate the great potential of Ha-CoV-2 as a robust platform for rapid quantification of SARS-CoV-2 variants and their susceptibility to neutralizing antibodies.",

We have therefore investigated the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-signalling architecture underpinning different channels on the same vesicle that drive separate pathways, using phagocytosis as a physiological stimulus. Lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup>-channels are a major Ca<sup>2+</sup> source driving particle uptake in macrophages, but different channels drive different aspects of Fc-receptor-mediated phagocytosis: TPC2 couples to dynamin activation, whilst TRPML1 couples to lysosomal exocytosis. We hypothesised that they are driven by discrete local plumes of Ca<sup>2+</sup> around open channels (Ca<sup>2+</sup> nanodomains). To test this, we optimized Ca<sup>2+</sup>-nanodomain recordings by screening panels of genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicators (GECIs) fused to TPC2 to monitor the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] next to the channel. Signal calibration accounting for the distance of the GECI from the channel mouth reveals that, during phagocytosis, TPC2 generates local Ca<sup>2+</sup> nanodomains around itself of up to 42 µM, nearly a hundred-fold greater than the global cytosolic [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] rise. We further show that TPC2 and TRPML1, though on the same lysosomes, generate autonomous Ca<sup>2+</sup> nanodomains of high [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] that are largely insulated from one another, a platform allowing their discrete Ca<sup>2+</sup>-decoding to promote unique respective physiologies.",

Polypropylene (PP) capillary-channeled polymer (C-CP) fiber columns are modified with the biotin-binding protein streptavidin (SAV) to capture biotinylated proteins. The loading characteristics of SAV on fiber supports were determined using breakthrough curves and frontal analysis. Based on adsorption data, a 3-min on-column loading at a flow rate of 0.5 mL min<sup>-1</sup> (295.2 cm h<sup>-1</sup>) with a SAV feed concentration of 0.5 mg mL<sup>-1</sup> produces a SAV loading capacity of 1.4 mg g<sup>-1</sup> fiber. SAV has an incredibly high affinity for the small-molecule biotin (10<sup>-14</sup> M), such that this binding relationship can be exploited by labeling a target protein with biotin via an Avi-tag. To evaluate the capture of the biotinylated proteins on the modified PP surface, the biotinylated versions of bovine serum albumin (b-BSA) and green fluorescent protein (b-GFP) were utilized as probe species. The loading buffer composition and flow rate were optimized towards protein capture. The non-ionic detergent Tween-20 was added to the deposition solutions to minimize non-specific binding. Values of 0.25-0.50% (v/v) Tween-20 in PBS exhibited better capture efficiency, while minimizing the non-specific binding for b-BSA and b-GFP, respectively. The C-CP fiber platform has the potential to provide a fast and low-cost method to capture targeted proteins for applications including protein purification or pull-down assays.",

The sensor contains the CR2 domain inserted into the β2 to β3 turn of the Enhanced Green Fluorescent Protein (EGFP).

Orai1 Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel-jGCaMP8 fusions were transfected into HEK 293A cells and jGCaMP8 fluorescence responses recorded by simultaneous total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy and whole-cell patch clamp electrophysiology. Noninactivating currents from the Orai1 Y80E mutant provided a steady flux of Ca<sup>2+</sup> controlled on a millisecond time scale by step changes in membrane potential. Test pulses to -100 mV produced Orai1 Y80E-jGCaMP8f fluorescence traces that unexpectedly declined by ~50% over 100 ms before reaching a stable plateau. Testing of Orai1-jGCaMP8f using unroofed cells further demonstrated that rapid and partial fluorescence inactivation is a property of the indicator itself, rather than channel function. Photoinactivation spontaneously recovered over 5 min in the dark, and recovery was accelerated in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Mutational analysis of residues near the tripeptide fluorophore of jGCaMP8f pointed to a mechanism: Q69M/C70V greatly increased (~90%) photoinactivation, reminiscent of fluorescent protein fluorophore cis-trans photoswitching. Indeed, 405-nm illumination of jGCaMP8f or 8m/8s/6f led to immediate photorecovery, and simultaneous illumination with 405 and 488-nm light blocked photoinactivation. Subsequent mutagenesis produced a variant, V203Y, that lacks photoinactivation but largely preserves the desirable properties of jGCaMP8f. Our results point to caution in interpreting rapidly changing Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals using jGCaMP8 and earlier series GECIs, suggest strategies to avoid photoswitching, and serve as a starting point to produce more photostable, and thus more accurate, GECI derivatives.",

However, the underlying mechanisms governing exosome secretion and regulation remain poorly understood. In this study, we employed a dual-reporter system consisting of bioluminescent Gaussia luciferase and fluorescent proteins to investigate the dynamics and regulation of exosome secretion in cultured human cells. Our results demonstrated that the engineered dual-reporters effectively monitored both exosome-mediated and ER-Golgi-mediated secretory pathways in a specific and quantitative manner. Notably, we observed distinct characteristics of exosome-mediated protein secretion, including significantly lower capacity and different dynamics compared to the ER-Golgi pathway. This phenomenon was observed in human kidney 293T cells and liver HepG2 cells, emphasizing the conserved nature of exosome-mediated secretion across cell types. Furthermore, we investigated the impact of brefeldin A (BFA), an inhibitor of ER-to-Golgi membrane trafficking, on protein secretion. Interestingly, BFA inhibited protein secretion via the ER-Golgi pathway while stimulating exosome-mediated protein secretion under same experimental conditions. Collectively, our study highlights the utility of the dual-reporter system for real-time monitoring and quantitative analysis of protein secretion through conventional ER-Golgi and unconventional exosome pathways. Moreover, our findings unveil distinct features of exosome-mediated protein secretion, shedding light on its differential capacity, dynamics, and regulatory mechanisms compared to ER-Golgi-mediated proteins in human cells.",

        "abstract": "In proton therapy, a highly steep distal dose penumbra can be utilized for dose conformity, given the Bragg peak characteristic of protons. However, the location of the Bragg peak in patients (i.e., the beam range) is very sensitive to range uncertainty. Even a small shift of beam range can produce a significant variation of delivered dose to tumor and normal tissues, thus degrading treatment quality and threatening patient safety. This range uncertainty issue, therefore, is one of the important aspects to be managed in proton therapy. For better management of range uncertainty, range verification has been widely studied, and prompt gamma imaging (PGI) is considered one of the promising methods in that effort. In this context, a PGI system named the gamma electron vertex imaging (GEVI) system was developed and recently upgraded for application to pencil-beam scanning (PBS) proton therapy. Here, we report the first experimental results using the therapeutic spot scanning proton beams. A homogeneous slab phantom and an anthropomorphic phantom were employed. Spherical and cubic planning target volumes (PTVs) were defined. Various range shift scenarios were introduced. Prompt gamma (PG) measurement was synchronized with beam irradiation. The measured PG distributions were aggregated to improve the PG statistics. The range shift was estimated based on the relative change of the centroid in the measured PG distribution. The estimated range shifts were analyzed by range shift mapping, confidence interval (CI) estimation, and statistical hypothesis testing. The range shift mapping results showed an obvious measured range shift tendency following the true shift values. However, some fluctuations were found for spots that had still-low PG statistics after spot aggregation. The 99% CI distributions showed clearly distributed range shift measurement data. The overall accuracy and precision for all investigated scenarios were 0.36 and 0.20 mm, respectively. The results of one-sample t-tests confirmed that every shift scenario could be observed up to 1 mm of shift. The ANOVA results proved that the measured range shift data could be discriminated from one another, except for 16 (of 138) comparison cases having 1-2 mm shift differences. This study demonstrated the feasibility of the GEVI system for measurement of range shift in spot scanning proton therapy. Our experimental results showed that the proton beam can be measured up to 1 mm of range shift with high accuracy and precision. We believe that the GEVI system is one of the most promising PGI systems for in vivo range verification. Further research for application to more various cases and patient treatments is planned.",

Four Craspase-based nucleic acid detection systems for genes from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), norovirus, and the influenza virus (IFV) were reconstituted with demonstrated specificity.

Importantly, the species-specific substrate cleavage specificity of Craspase enabled multiplexed diagnosis, as demonstrated by the reconstituted composite systems for simultaneous detection of two genes from the same virus (SARS-CoV-2, spike and nsp12) or two types of viruses (SARS-CoV-2 and IFV). The assay could be further expanded by diversifying the fluorescent tags in the substrate and including Craspase systems from various species, thus potentially providing an easily adaptable platform for clinical diagnosis.",

Methods based on passive sampling provide the sampling and pre-concentration of the analytes in-situ, which makes the sample treatment less time consuming and costly than using discrete grab sampling. In this study, ceramic passive samplers (CPSs) using mixed-mode strong cation-exchange sorbent (Oasis MCX) as retention phase were evaluated for the determination of a group of 21 therapeutic and illicit drugs and some of their metabolites in river water samples that were determined by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. After assessing the stability of the analytes, the CPSs were calibrated for 9 days with bottled water and river water, obtaining, for the 19 stable compounds, sample rates (Rs) ranging between 0.180 and 1.767 mL/day and diffusion coefficients (De) between 2.02E-8 and 2.81E-7 cm<sup>2</sup>/s. Once calibrated, CPSs were deployed for the determination of contaminants in the Ebre River, with good reproducibility, and some of the analytes were determined, including amongst others, gabapentin at 76 ng/L, caffeine at 203 ng/L or diclofenac amine at 57 ng/L.

CRISPR whole-genome screens can be used to rapidly discover host factors that contribute to or impair viral entry. However, when using live viruses and cellular lethality for selection, these screens can identify an overwhelming number of genes without specificity for the stage of the viral infection cycle. New screening methods are needed to identify host machinery contributing to specific steps of viral infection. Here, we developed a CRISPR whole-genome screen and counter-screen strategy based on a pseudoviral platform that allowed identification of genes specific to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike and vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV-G) mediated entry. Screening of SARS-CoV-2 spike and VSV-G on the same lentiviral pseudovirus allowed the identification of entry-specific genes relative to genes associated with retro-transcription, integration, and reporter expression from the lentiviral pseudovirus. Second, a Cre-Gag fusion protein packaged into the pseudovirus was used to bypass retro-transcription and integration by directly activating a floxed fluorescent protein reporter upon entry  reduced the number of gene hits and increase specificity for viral entry. Our approach correctly identified SARS-CoV-2 and VSV-G receptors ACE2 and low-density lipoprotein receptors, respectively, and distinguished genes associated with retroviral reporter expression from envelope-mediated entry. Moreover, the CRE-Gag fusion/flox reporter increased the screen specificity for viral entry-associated genes. Validation of a few hits demonstrates that this approach distinguishes envelope-specific host factors from genes affecting reporter expression. Overall, this approach provides a new strategy for identifying host genes influencing viral entry without the confounding complexity of live-viral screens which produce long gene lists associated with all aspects of viral pathogenesis and replication.",

Manual annotation of neuronal boundaries is time-consuming, requires human expertise, and has intra/interobserver variances. Also, determining where the neuron's cell body ends and where the axons and dendrites begin is taxing. We developed a deep-learning-based approach that uses a state-of-the-art shifted windows (Swin) transformer for automated, reproducible, fast, and unbiased 2D detection and segmentation of neuronal somas imaged in mouse acute brain slices by multiphoton microscopy. We tested our Swin algorithm during different experimental conditions of low and high signal fluorescence. Our algorithm achieved a mean Dice score of 0.91, a precision of 0.83, and a recall of 0.86. Compared with two different convolutional neural networks, the Swin transformer outperformed them in detecting the cell boundaries of GCamP6s expressing neurons. Thus, our Swin transform algorithm can assist in the fast and accurate segmentation of fluorescently labeled neuronal cell bodies in thick acute brain slices.

Due to phenomenological similarities between these illusions, previous research has assumed that some are caused by common mechanisms. However, this assumption has yet to be directly tested. This study investigates this assumption by exploiting between-participant variations in illusion magnitude. During two sessions, 106 participants viewed the flash-lag effect, luminance flash-lag effect, Fröhlich effect, flash-drag effect, flash-grab effect, motion-induced position shift, twinkle-goes effect, and the flash-jump effect. For each effect, the magnitude of the illusion was reliable within participants, strongly correlating between sessions. When the pairwise correlations of averaged illusions magnitudes were explored, two clusters of statistically significant positively correlated illusions were identified. The first cluster comprised the flash-grab effect, motion-induced position shift, and twinkle-goes effect. The second cluster comprised the Fröhlich and flash-drag effect. The fact that within each of these two clusters, individual differences in illusion magnitude were correlated suggests that these clusters may reflect shared underlying mechanisms. An exploratory factor analysis provided additional evidence that these correlated clusters shared an underlying factor, with each cluster loading onto their own factor. Overall, our results reveal that, contrary to the prevailing perspective in the literature, while some motion-position illusions share processes, most of these illusions are unlikely to reflect any shared processes, instead implicating unique mechanisms.",

        "abstract": "A better understanding of HIV-1 latency is a research priority in HIV cure research. Conversely, little is known about the latency characteristics of HIV-2, the closely related human lentivirus. Though both viruses cause AIDS, HIV-2 infection progresses more slowly with significantly lower viral loads, even when corrected for CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell counts. Hence a direct comparison of latency characteristics between HIV-1 and HIV-2 could provide important clues towards a functional cure. Transduction of SupT1 cells with single-round HIV-1 and HIV-2 viruses with an enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) reporter showed higher levels of eGFP expression for HIV-2 than HIV-1, while HIV-1 expression appeared more cytotoxic. To compare HIV-1 and HIV-2 gene expression, latency and reactivation in more detail, we have generated HIV-2 OGH, a replication deficient, near full- length, double reporter virus that discriminates latently and productively infected cells in cell culture. This construct is based on HIV-1 OGH, and to our knowledge, first of its kind for HIV-2. Using this construct we have observed a higher eGFP expression for HIV-2, but higher losses of HIV-1 transduced cells in SupT1 and Jurkat cells and a reduced sensitivity of HIV-2 for reactivation with TNF-α. In addition, we have analysed HIV-2 integration sites and their epigenetic environment. HIV-1 and HIV-2 share a preference for actively transcribed genes in gene-dense regions and favor active chromatin marks while disfavoring methylation markers associated with heterochromatin. In conclusion the HIV-2 OGH construct provides an interesting tool for studying HIV-2 expression, latency and reactivation. As simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) and HIV-2 have been proposed to model a functional HIV cure, a better understanding of the mechanisms governing HIV-2 and SIV latency will be important to move forward. Further research is needed to investigate if HIV-2 uses similar mechanisms as HIV-1 to achieve its integration site selectivity.",

        "abstract": "Toxoplasma gondii is an obligate intracellular protozoan parasite that commonly infects mammals and birds throughout the world. This protocol describes murine models of acute T. gondii infection, toxoplasmic encephalitis and toxoplasma retinochoroiditis. T. gondii infection in severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice, deficient in T and B cells, has allowed for the study of T cell-independent mechanisms of defense against intracellular organisms, as described here. The uracil auxotroph strain cps1-1 and temperature-sensitive mutant strains of T. gondii induce protection against challenge with virulent strains of the parasite. They have allowed studies of immunization and adoptive-transfer experiments. A protocol is provided for infection with these mutant strains. The EGS strain of T. gondii has the unique feature of spontaneously forming tissue cysts in cell culture. Dual fluorescent reporter stains of this strain have allowed the study of tachyzoite to bradyzoite transitions in vitro and in vivo. A protocol for in vitro and in vivo growth of this strain and tissue cyst isolation is provided. Genetic manipulation of T. gondii and mice has led to the development of parasites that express fluorescent proteins as well as mice with fluorescently labeled leukocytes. This together with the use of T. gondii that express model antigens and transgenic mice that express the appropriate T cell receptor have facilitated the in vivo study of parasite host-interaction. In addition, parasites that express bioluminescent markers have made it possible to study the dynamics of infection in real time using bioluminescence imaging. Support protocols present methodology for evaluation of progression of infection and immune response to the parasite that includes these newer methodologies. In addition, support protocols address the maintenance of T. gondii tissue cysts and tachyzoites, as well as preparation of T. gondii lysate antigens. © 2023 The Authors.

        "abstract": "The default mode network (DMN) is a large-scale brain network known to be suppressed during a wide range of cognitive tasks. However, our comprehension of its role in naturalistic and unconstrained behaviors has remained elusive because most research on the DMN has been conducted within the restrictive confines of MRI scanners. Here we use multisite GCaMP fiber photometry with simultaneous videography to probe DMN function in awake, freely exploring rats. We examined neural dynamics in three core DMN nodes- the retrosplenial cortex, cingulate cortex, and prelimbic cortex- as well as the anterior insula node of the salience network, and their association with the rats' spatial exploration behaviors. We found that DMN nodes displayed a hierarchical functional organization during spatial exploration, characterized by stronger coupling with each other than with the anterior insula. Crucially, these DMN nodes encoded the kinematics of spatial exploration, including linear and angular velocity. Additionally, we identified latent brain states that encoded distinct patterns of time-varying exploration behaviors and discovered that higher linear velocity was associated with enhanced DMN activity, heightened synchronization among DMN nodes, and increased anticorrelation between the DMN and anterior insula. Our findings highlight the involvement of the DMN in collectively and dynamically encoding spatial exploration in a real-world setting. Our findings challenge the notion that the DMN is primarily a \"task-negative\" network disengaged from the external world. By illuminating the DMN's role in naturalistic behaviors, our study underscores the importance of investigating brain network function in ecologically valid contexts.",

Here we constructed a hypoxia-inducible promoter library for P. pastoris through error-prone PCR of Pichia stipitis ADH2 promoter (Ps<sub>ADH2</sub>). The library of 30 selected promoters showing 0.4- to 5.5-fold of the Ps<sub>ADH2</sub> activity was obtained through high-throughput screening in microplates using the reporter yeast-enhanced green fluorescent protein. Two strong promoters, AM23 and AM30, were further characterized in shake flask cultures at high and low dissolved oxygen levels. They responded more sensitively to the low dissolved oxygen level, achieving a 4.6-, 7.9-fold and 3.6-, 7.7-fold higher fluorescence intensity and transcript level, respectively, than the wild-type Ps<sub>ADH2</sub>. Their hypoxia-inducible properties were confirmed with two additional reporters: β-galactosidase and Vitreoscilla hemoglobin, to demonstrate the broad applicability of the promoter library. During the typical fermentation process in shake flasks, the promoter AM30 showed strong expression with cell growth and decreased oxygen levels, without any additional chemical inducers or operations. Since the potent industrial host P. pastoris is recognized as an easy to scale-up system, it is reasonable to expect that the obtained hypoxia-inducible promoter library may have great potential to enable convenient regulation of gene expression under industrial fermentations which are usually run under oxygen limitation due to high cell density cultivations.",

While Eulerian monitoring is practical, it provides a limited understanding of spatial and temporal heterogeneity. We designed and built The Navigator, a Lagrangian (i.e., along a flow path) monitoring system that offers cost-effective solutions for in-situ, real-time data collection in surface freshwater ecosystems. The Navigator features a suite of technologies, including an autonomous surface vehicle with GPS and LTE connectivity, water quality sensors, a depth sonar, a camera, and a webpage dashboard to visualize real-time data. With these technologies, The Navigator provides insight into where, how, and why water quality and quantity change over time and space as it moves with the current or follows user-specified pathways. We tested The Navigator monitoring water quality parameters at high spatial-temporal resolution in multiple surface water bodies in New Mexico (USA) to: (1) identify water quality changes associated with land use changes along a 7th-order reach in the Rio Grande, (2) identify the fate of wildfire disturbances ∼175 km downstream of a burned watershed affected by the largest wildfire ever recorded in the state, (3) monitor the water quality of a recreational fishing pond in the City of Albuquerque. Our three successful tests confirm that The Navigator is an affordable (USD 5,101 in 2023) monitoring system that can be used to address questions involving mass and energy balances in surface waters.",

        "abstract": "Metal-based high-touch surfaces used for diverse applications in everyday use, like handrails, playground grab handles, doorknobs, ATM touch pads, and desks, are the most common targets for pollution with a variety of microbes; there is thus a need to improve their antimicrobial properties, an issue which has become a challenge in recent years, particularly after the COVID-19 pandemic. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), drug-resistant pathogens are one of the main concerns to global health today, as they lead to longer hospital stays and increased medical costs. Generally, the development of antimicrobial surfaces is related to the utilization of chemical methods via deposition on surfaces in the forms of various types of coatings. However, the addition of chemical substances onto a surface can induce unwanted effects, since it causes surface chemistry changes and, in some cases, cannot provide long-lasting results. A novel approach of utilising ultra-short laser radiation for the treatment of metallic surfaces by inducing a variety of micro- and nanostructuration is elaborated upon in the current research, estimating the optimum relation between the wettability and roughness characteristics for the creation of antimicrobial properties for such high-touch surfaces. In the current study, AISI 304-304L stainless steel metal was used as a benchmark material. Surface texturing via laser ablation with femtosecond laser pulses is an effective method, since it enables the formation of a variety of surface patterns, along with the creation of bimodal roughness, in one-step processing. In this investigation, a precise approach toward developing hydrophobic stainless steel surfaces with tunable adherence using femtosecond laser-induced modification is described. The impact of basic femtosecond laser processing parameters, like the scanning velocity, laser energy, and wettability properties of the laser-processed stainless steel samples, are examined. It is identified that the topography and morphology of laser-induced surface structures can be efficiently changed by adapting the laser processing parameters to create structures, which facilitate the transfer of surface properties from extremely low to high surface wettability.",

        "abstract": "Volatile anesthetics alter presynaptic function through effects on Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and neurotransmitter release. These actions are proposed to play important roles in their pleiotropic neurophysiological effects including immobility, unconsciousness and amnesia. Nitric oxide and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (NO/cGMP) signaling has been implicated in presynaptic mechanisms, and disruption of NO/cGMP signaling has been shown to alter sensitivity to volatile anesthetics in vivo. We investigated volatile anesthetic actions NO/cGMP signaling in relation to presynaptic function in cultured rat hippocampal neurons using pharmacological tools and genetically encoded biosensors and sequestering probes of cGMP levels. Using the fluorescent cGMP biosensor cGull, we found that electrical stimulation-evoked NMDA-type glutamate receptor-independent presynaptic cGMP transients were inhibited 33.2% by isoflurane (0.51 mM) and 26.4% by sevoflurane (0.57 mM) (p < 0.0001) compared to control stimulation without anesthetic. Stimulation-evoked cGMP transients were blocked by the nonselective inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase N-ω-nitro-l-arginine, but not by the selective neuronal nitric oxide synthase inhibitor N5-(1-imino-3-butenyl)-l-ornithine. Isoflurane and sevoflurane inhibition of stimulation-evoked increases in presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration, measured with synaptophysin-GCaMP6f, and of synaptic vesicle exocytosis, measured with synaptophysin-pHlourin, was attenuated in neurons expressing the cGMP scavenger protein sponge (inhibition of exocytosis reduced by 54% for isoflurane and by 53% for sevoflurane). The anesthetic-induced reduction in presynaptic excitability was partially occluded by inhibition of HCN channels, a cGMP-modulated excitatory ion channel that can facilitate glutamate release. We propose that volatile anesthetics depress presynaptic cGMP signaling and downstream effectors like HCN channels that are essential to presynaptic function and excitability. These findings identify novel mechanisms by which volatile anesthetics depress synaptic transmission via second messenger signaling involving the NO/cGMP pathway in hippocampal neurons.",

        "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00508-23",
        "abstract": "Previously, we developed an infectious hepatitis E virus (HEV) harboring the nanoKAZ gene in the hypervariable region of the open reading frame 1 (ORF1) of the HEV3b (JE03-1760F/P10) genome and demonstrated the usefulness for screening anti-HEV drugs that inhibit the early infection process. In the present study, we constructed another reporter HEV (HEV3b-HiBiT) by placing a minimized HiBiT tag derived from NanoLuc luciferase at the 3'-end of the viral capsid (ORF2) coding sequence. It replicated efficiently in PLC/PRF/5 cells, produced membrane-associated particles identical to those of the parental virus, and was genetically stable and infectious. The HiBiT tag was fused to both secreted ORF2s (ORF2s-HiBiT) and ORF2c capsid protein (ORF2c-HiBiT). The ORF2c-HiBiT formed membrane-associated HEV particles (eHEV3b-HiBiT). By treating these particles with digitonin, we demonstrated that the HiBiT tag was expressed on the surface of capsid and was present inside the lipid membrane. To simplify the measurement of luciferase activity and provide a more convenient screening platform, we constructed an ORF2s-defective mutant (HEV3b-HiBiT/ΔORF2s) in which the secreted ORF2s are suppressed. We used this system to evaluate the effects of introducing small interfering RNAs and treatment with an inhibitor or accelerator of exosomal release on HEV egress and demonstrated that the effects on virus release can readily be analyzed. Therefore, HEV3b-HiBiT and HEV3b-HiBiT/ΔORF2s reporters may be useful for investigating the virus life cycle and can serve as a more convenient screening platform to search for candidate drugs targeting the late stage of HEV infection such as particle formation and release. IMPORTANCE The construction of recombinant infectious viruses harboring a stable luminescence reporter gene is essential for investigations of the viral life cycle, such as viral replication and pathogenesis, and the development of novel antiviral drugs. However, it is difficult to maintain the stability of a large foreign gene inserted into the viral genome. In the present study, we successfully generated a recombinant HEV harboring the 11-amino acid HiBiT tag in the ORF2 coding region and demonstrated the infectivity, efficient virus growth, particle morphology, and genetic stability, suggesting that this recombinant HEV is useful for <i>in vitro</i> assays. Furthermore, this system can serve as a more convenient screening platform for anti-HEV drugs. Thus, an infectious recombinant HEV is a powerful approach not only for elucidating the molecular mechanisms of the viral life cycle but also for the screening and development of novel antiviral agents.",

In computing the ERIs of varying angular momentum, both the central processing unit (CPU) and the graphics processing unit (GPU) have their respective advantages. To accelerate the ERI evaluation and Fock matrix generation, a hybrid CPU/GPU method has been proposed to maximize the computational power of both CPU and GPU while overlapping the CPU and GPU computations. This method employs a task queue where each task corresponds to ERIs with the same angular momentum. The queue begins with ERIs of low angular momentum, which are computationally efficient on GPUs, and ends with ERIs of high angular momentum, which are better suited for CPU computation. CPUs and GPUs dynamically grab and complete tasks from the start and end of the queue using OpenMP dynamic scheduling until all tasks are finished. The hybrid CPU/GPU computation offers the advantage of enabling calculations with arbitrary angular momentum. Test calculations showed that the hybrid CPU/GPU algorithm is more efficient than \"GPU-only\" when using a single GPU. However, as more GPUs are involved, the advantage diminishes or disappears. The scaling exponents of the hybrid method were slightly higher than \"GPU-only,\" but the pre-exponent factor was significantly lower, making the hybrid method more effective overall.",

Bioluminescent reporter mice harboring luciferases for general use have been limited to a classical luciferase, Luc2, from Photinus pyralis, and have been extremely powerful for various in vivo studies. However, applicability of reporter mice for in vivo BLI could be further accelerated by increasing light intensity through the use of other luciferases and/or by improving the biodistribution of their substrates in the animal body. Here we created two Cre-dependent reporter mice incorporating luciferases oFluc derived from Pyrocoeli matsumurai and Akaluc, both of which had been reported previously to be brighter than Luc2 when using appropriate substrates; we then tested their bioluminescence in neural tissues and other organs in living mice. When expressed throughout the body, both luciferases emitted an intense yellow (oFluc) or far-red (Akaluc) light easily visible to the naked eye. oFluc and Akaluc were similarly bright in the pancreas for in vivo BLI; however, Akaluc was superior to oFluc for brain imaging, because its substrate, AkaLumine-HCl, was distributed to the brain more efficiently than the oFluc substrate, D-luciferin. We also demonstrated that the lights produced by oFluc and Akaluc were sufficiently spectrally distinct from each other for dual-color imaging in a single living mouse. Taken together, these novel bioluminescent reporter mice are an ideal source of cells with bright bioluminescence and may facilitate in vivo BLI of various tissues/organs for preclinical and biomedical research in combination with a wide variety of Cre-driver mice.",

Using recombinant AAV9-based delivery to sensory neurons, we found a reversal of acute pain behavior and diminished neuronal activity using <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> GCaMP imaging on activation of PSAM<sup>4</sup>-GlyR with varenicline. A significant reduction in inflammatory heat hyperalgesia and oxaliplatin-induced cold allodynia was also observed.

        "abstract": "Type 2 ryanodine receptor (RyR2) is a Ca<sup>2+</sup> release channel on the endoplasmic (ER)/sarcoplasmic reticulum that plays a central role in the excitation-contraction coupling in the heart. Hyperactivity of RyR2 has been linked to ventricular arrhythmias in patients with catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia and heart failure, where spontaneous Ca<sup>2+</sup> release via hyperactivated RyR2 depolarizes diastolic membrane potential to induce triggered activity. In such cases, drugs that suppress RyR2 activity are expected to prevent the arrhythmias, but there is no clinically available RyR2 inhibitors at present. In this study, we searched for RyR2 inhibitors from a well-characterized compound library using a recently developed ER Ca<sup>2+</sup>-based assay, where the inhibition of RyR2 activity was detected by the increase in ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals from R-CEPIA1er, a genetically encoded ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator, in RyR2-expressing HEK293 cells. By screening 1535 compounds in the library, we identified three compounds (chloroxylenol, methyl orsellinate, and riluzole) that greatly increased the ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal. All of the three compounds suppressed spontaneous Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations in RyR2-expressing HEK293 cells and correspondingly reduced the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent [<sup>3</sup>H]ryanodine binding activity. In cardiomyocytes from RyR2-mutant mice, the three compounds effectively suppressed abnormal Ca<sup>2+</sup> waves without substantial effects on the action-potential-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients. These results confirm that ER Ca<sup>2+</sup>-based screening is useful for identifying modulators of ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> release channels and suggest that RyR2 inhibitors have potential to be developed as a new category of antiarrhythmic drugs. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: We successfully identified three compounds having RyR2 inhibitory action from a well-characterized compound library using an endoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup>-based assay, and demonstrated that these compounds suppressed arrhythmogenic Ca<sup>2+</sup> wave generation without substantially affecting physiological action-potential induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in cardiomyocytes.

The genetic defects in membrane function causing HS lead to perturbation of the RBC metabolome, with altered glycolysis. In mice genetically lacking protein 4.2 (4.2-/-; Epb42), a murine model of HS, we showed increased expression of pyruvate kinase (PK) isoforms in whole and fractioned RBCs in conjunction with abnormalities in the glycolytic pathway and in the glutathione (GSH) system. Mitapivat, a PK activator, metabolically reprogrammed 4.2-/- mouse RBCs with amelioration of glycolysis and the GSH cycle. This resulted in improved osmotic fragility, reduced phosphatidylserine positivity, amelioration of RBC cation content, reduction of Na/K/Cl cotransport and Na/H-exchange overactivation, and decrease in erythroid vesicles release in vitro. Mitapivat treatment significantly decreased erythrophagocytosis and beneficially affected iron homeostasis. In mild-to-moderate HS, the beneficial effect of splenectomy is still controversial. Here, we showed that splenectomy improves anemia in 4.2-/- mice and that mitapivat is noninferior to splenectomy. An additional benefit of mitapivat treatment was lower expression of markers of inflammatory vasculopathy in 4.2-/- mice with or without splenectomy, indicating a multisystemic action of mitapivat. These findings support the notion that mitapivat treatment should be considered for symptomatic HS.",

Such behaviors may act synergistically to explain the high comorbidity between stimulant use and gambling disorder. The salient audiovisual stimuli of modern electronic gambling may exacerbate the situation. To probe these interactions, we sensitized ventral tegmental area DA neurons via chronic chemogenetic stimulation while rats (n = 134) learned a rat gambling task in the presence or absence of casino-like cues. The same rats then learned to self-administer cocaine. In a separate cohort (n = 25), we confirmed that our chemogenetic methods sensitized the locomotor response to cocaine and potentiated phasic excitability of ventral tegmental area DA neurons through in vivo electrophysiological recordings. In the absence of cues, sensitization promoted risk taking in both sexes. When rewards were cued, sensitization expedited the development of a risk-preferring phenotype in males while attenuating cue-induced risk taking in females. While these results provide further confirmation that ventral tegmental area DA neurons critically modulate risky decision making, they also reveal stark sex differences in the decisional impact that dopaminergic signals exert when winning outcomes are cued. As previously observed, risky decision making on the cued rat gambling task increased as both males and females learned to self-administer cocaine. The combination of DA sensitization and win-paired cues while gambling led to significantly greater cocaine taking, but these rats did not show any increase in risky choice as a result. Therefore, cocaine and heavily cued gambles may partially substitute for each other once the DA system has been rendered labile through sensitization, thereby compounding addiction risk across modalities.",

Yet most swarms developed so far are limited to dense particle aggregates, far simpler than complicated three-dimensional assemblies of anisotropic particles. Here, we show via assembly path design that complex hollow tubular structures can be assembled from simple isotropic colloidal spheres and those complicated, metastable, microtubes can be formed from simple, energetically favorable colloidal membranes. The assembled microtubes can remain intact and roll under a precessing magnetic field, with propulsion directions and velocities precisely controlled by field components. The hollow spaces inside enable these tubular microrobots to grab, transport, and release cargos on command. We also demonstrate unique compressing and uncompressing capabilities with our tubular microrobots, making them effective microtweezers. Our work shows that complicated microrobots can be transformed from simple assemblies, providing an insight on building micromachines.",

We employed inducible Cre (iCre) mouse models to target specific cell populations including c-kitCreER <sup><i>T2</i></sup> to target interstitial cells of Cajal like cells; <i>PdgfrβCreER</i> <sup><i>T2</i></sup> to target pericyte-like cells; <i>PdgfrαCreER</i> <sup><i>TM</i></sup> to target CD34<sup>+</sup> adventitial cells; and <i>Myh11CreER</i> <sup><i>T2</i></sup> to target lymphatic muscle cells (LMCs) directly. These inducible Cre lines were crossed to the fluorescent reporter ROSA26mT/mG, the genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor GCaMP6f, and the light-activated cation channel rhodopsin2 (ChR2). Only LMCs consistently, but heterogeneously, displayed spontaneous Ca<sup>2+</sup> events during the diastolic period of the contraction cycle, and whose frequency was modulated in a pressure-dependent manner. Further, optogenetic depolarization with ChR2 only induced propagated contractions in LMCs. Membrane potential recordings in LMCs demonstrated that the rate of diastolic depolarization significantly correlated with contraction frequency. These findings support the conclusion that LMCs, or a subset of LMCs, are responsible for mouse cLV pacemaking.",

The mechanism of somatostatin-mediated communication between delta and beta cells is not well-understood, which we address in this study via the ciliary somatostatin receptor 3 (SSTR3). Primary cilia are membrane organelles that act as signaling hubs in islets by virtue of their subcellular location and enrichment in signaling proteins such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). We show that SSTR3, a ciliary GPCR, mediates somatostatin suppression of insulin secretion in mouse islets. Quantitative analysis of calcium flux using a mouse model of genetically encoded beta cell-specific GCaMP6f calcium reporter shows that somatostatin signaling alters beta cell calcium flux after physiologic glucose stimulation, an effect that depends on endogenous SSTR3 expression and the presence of intact primary cilia on beta cells. Comparative <i>in vitro</i> studies using SSTR isoform antagonists demonstrate a role for SSTR3 in mediating somatostatin regulation of insulin secretion in mouse islets. Our findings support a model in which ciliary SSTR3 mediates a distinct pathway of delta-to-beta cell regulatory crosstalk and may serve as a target for paracrine modulation.",

Yet, there remains a paucity of research focusing on the migration and release processes of radionuclides combined with colloids associated with the repository, e.g., granite, and especially fracture-filling materials (FFMs). Further, the impact of heterogeneity on radionuclide migration in these media remains unclear. Thus, laboratory-scale column experiments were conducted to explore the migration behaviors of Eu(III) and bentonite colloids (BCs) in both homogeneously and heterogeneously configured columns. It was observed that the migration of BCs can be influenced by the configuration of media and ionic strength of solution. FFMs exhibited a higher retardation capacity for BCs than granite, and the retention ability of the heterogenous media (Granite-FFMs) was intermediate between that of granite and FFMs. The retardation of BCs increased with increasing ionic strength. Despite the \"irreversibility\" of Eu(III) adsorption on these media with insensitivity on ionic strength, the presence of BCs can grab the immobilized Eu(III) and carry more amount of adsorbed Eu(III) into the mobile phase at higher ionic strength. Even with the rinse of BCs flow, FFMs still revealed a better retardation ability for Eu(III) than granite. These findings are essential for predicting the geological fate and the release risk of radionuclides in the Beishan repository environment.",

Ten sampling stations were specifically selected, including locations near stream discharge points, maritime transportation piers, and port areas. Surface water samples were collected using a manta trawl net, while sediment samples were obtained using a Van Veen grab. The mean MP abundances in surface water ranged from 1,083,882 to 8,091,684 items/km<sup>2</sup>. Fragment type MPs were dominant. In terms of size category, it was found that MP s of 500µm size were dominant. The dominant color of MPs was white. ATR-FTIR analyses revealed that polyethylene and polypropylene were the dominant polymer types. MP concentrations in sediment ranged from 2,125 to 4,925 items/m<sup>2</sup>, with fiber-type MPs being the most abundant. Black-colored MPs were found to dominate in sediment samples. Overall, the MP levels in Izmir Bay were higher than previous studies findings.

It was constructed on cotton cloth using wax printing technology (batik stamp) as cloth-based microfluidic devices (CMDs). Here, it uses micro volumes of samples to perform the reaction in the sensing zones, where the sensitive reagents are immobilized so that it can collect and analyze the sweat (lactic acid, sodium ions, and pH) as the model for sweat analytes.

During development, the maturation of OHC afferent connectivity is refined by coordinated spontaneous Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity in both sensory and non-sensory cells. Calcium signalling in neonatal OHCs can be modulated by oncomodulin (OCM, β-parvalbumin), an EF-hand calcium-binding protein. Here, we investigated whether OCM regulates OHC spontaneous Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity and afferent connectivity during development. Using a genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor (GCaMP6s) expressed in OHCs in wild-type (Ocm<sup>+/+</sup> ) and Ocm knockout (Ocm<sup>-/-</sup> ) littermates, we found increased spontaneous Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity and upregulation of purinergic receptors in OHCs from Ocm<sup>-/-</sup> cochlea immediately following birth. The afferent synaptic maturation of OHCs was delayed in the absence of OCM, leading to an increased number of ribbon synapses and afferent fibres on Ocm<sup>-/-</sup> OHCs before hearing onset. We propose that OCM regulates the spontaneous Ca<sup>2+</sup> signalling in the developing cochlea and the maturation of OHC afferent innervation. KEY POINTS: Cochlear outer hair cells (OHCs) exhibit spontaneous Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity during a narrow period of neonatal development. OHC afferent maturation and connectivity requires spontaneous Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity. Oncomodulin (OCM, β-parvalbumin), an EF-hand calcium-binding protein, modulates Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in immature OHCs. Using transgenic mice that endogenously expressed a Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor, GCaMP6s, we found increased spontaneous Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity and upregulated purinergic receptors in Ocm<sup>-/-</sup> OHCs. The maturation of afferent synapses in Ocm<sup>-/-</sup> OHCs was also delayed, leading to an upregulation of ribbon synapses and afferent fibres in Ocm<sup>-/-</sup> OHCs before hearing onset. We propose that OCM plays an important role in modulating Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity, expression of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels and afferent innervation in developing OHCs.",

This study aims to use multiple cross-validation techniques to generate an accurate estimation of the environmental risk of organic contaminants (OCs) in an internationally important coastal wetland, to identify compounds of concern and their potential sources and risk factors. Microporous polyethylene tube (MPT) passive samplers were deployed at 12 locations across L'Albufera Natural Park with concurrent grab samples collected. A subset of MPT samplers were also analysed by an additional laboratory in Australia to widen the range of contaminants and assess interlaboratory reproducibility of results. Forty-three pesticides, 20 pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), 20 per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and 4 organophosphorus flame retardants (OPFRs) were detected in the MPT samplers. The fungicides tebuconazole and difenoconazole were detected at the highest concentrations in passive samplers (maximum concentrations, 153 ng sampler<sup>-1</sup> and 106 ng sampler<sup>-1</sup>, respectively). Several other pesticides were detected in all locations (mean concentrations >1 ng sampler<sup>-1</sup>). The compounds fenamiphos, propyzamide, difenoconazole, propiconazole, metsulfuron methyl, sodium bis (perfluorohexyl) phosphinate (6:6 PFPiA), 6:2 fluorotelomer sulfonamide alkylbetaine (6:2 FTAB), 6:2 fluorotelomersulfonate (6:2 FTS), citalopram desmethyl and citalopram were reported in the wetland for the first time. Spatial distribution analysis revealed higher pesticide concentrations in the North of L'Albufera. A risk quotient (RQ) analysis showed that ibuprofen is of concern in the area.

These experiences were then compared to understand intergenerational trauma. The study also aimed to identify the factors affecting PTSD prevalence, the role of social support, and the participants' experience with mental health services. A total of 237 Kosovar Albanians (121 parents, 116 youth) from all seven districts of Kosovo were included in this study. Study variables were measured using the PTSD Checklist, the Life Events Checklist, Criterion A, and the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support. The results revealed that the youth had significantly higher levels of perceived PTSD symptoms and lower levels of perceived support than their parents. Youth whose parents had PTSD were more prone to experiencing PTSD symptoms than those whose parents did not have PTSD. These youth also experienced significantly more traumatic situations, such as exposure to sudden violent death or accidental death, assault with a weapon, sexual assault, and captivity. Participants with perceived PTSD and lower perceived social support needed mental health interventions significantly more than those without PTSD symptoms. The findings emphasize the importance of addressing the intergenerational nature of PTSD and identifying factors affecting its prevalence, including social support and access to mental health services. The study underscores the need for a comprehensive approach to examine the complex and diverse nature of PTSD and its impact on individuals, families, and communities, especially in conflict-prone or conflict-affected societies.",

Despite extensive studies investigating the underlying mechanisms of mTBI-associated chronic pain, the role of inflammation in long-term pain after mTBIs is not fully elucidated. Given the shifting dynamics of inflammation, it is important to understand the spatial-longitudinal changes in inflammatory processes following mTBIs and their effects on TBI-related pain. We utilized a recently developed transgenic caspase-1 luciferase reporter mouse model to monitor caspase-1 activation through a thinned skull window in the in vivo setting following three closed-head mTBI events. Organotypic coronal brain slice cultures and acutely dissociated dorsal root ganglion (DRG) cells provided tissue-relevant context of inflammation signal. Mechanical allodynia was assessed by mechanical withdrawal threshold to von Frey and thermal hyperalgesia withdrawal latency to radiant heat. Mouse grimace scale (MGS) was used to detect spontaneous or non-evoked pain. In some experiments, mice were prophylactically treated with MCC950, a potent small molecule inhibitor of NLRP3 inflammasome assembly to inhibit injury-induced inflammatory signaling. Bioluminescence spatiotemporal dynamics were quantified in the head and hind paws, and caspase-1 activation was confirmed by immunoblot. Immunofluorescence staining was used to monitor the progression of astrogliosis and microglial activation in ex vivo brain tissue following repetitive closed-head mTBIs. Mice with repetitive closed-head mTBIs exhibited significant increases of the bioluminescence signals within the brain and paws in vivo for at least one week after each injury. Consistently, immunoblotting and immunofluorescence experiments confirmed that mTBIs led to caspase-1 activation, astrogliosis, and microgliosis. Persistent changes in MGS and hind paw withdrawal thresholds, indicative of pain states, were observed post-injury in the same mTBI animals in vivo. We also observed enhanced inflammatory responses in ex vivo brain slice preparations and DRG for at least 3 days following mTBIs. In vivo treatment with MCC950 significantly reduced caspase-1 activation-associated bioluminescent signals in vivo and decreased stimulus-evoked and non-stimulus evoked nociception. Our findings suggest that the inflammatory states in the brain and peripheral nervous system following repeated mTBIs are coincidental with the development of nociceptive sensitization, and that these events can be significantly reduced by inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome activation.",

While this kind of mechanoregulatory process is well recognized in eukaryotic systems, it is not known whether such a process occurs in bacteria. In Vibrio cholerae, antibiotic-induced damage to the load-bearing cell wall promotes increased signaling by the two-component system VxrAB, which stimulates cell wall synthesis. Here we show that changes in mechanical stress within the cell envelope are sufficient to stimulate VxrAB signaling in the absence of antibiotics. We applied mechanical forces to individual bacteria using three distinct loading modalities: extrusion loading within a microfluidic device, direct compression and hydrostatic pressure. In all cases, VxrAB signaling, as indicated by a fluorescent protein reporter, was increased in cells submitted to greater magnitudes of mechanical loading, hence diverse forms of mechanical stimuli activate VxrAB signaling. Reduction in cell envelope stiffness following removal of the endopeptidase ShyA led to large increases in cell envelope deformation and substantially increased VxrAB response, further supporting the responsiveness of VxrAB. Our findings demonstrate a mechanosensitive gene regulatory system in bacteria and suggest that mechanical signals may contribute to the regulation of cell wall homeostasis.",

On intranasal delivery of GC-luciferase-plasmid nanoparticles to Balb/ C mice at 4 doses, ranging from 0.02 to 0.1 mg/ kg, luciferase activity was observed qualitatively in intact mouse brains, 48 h after intranasal, using the IV-VIS visualisation. In further confirmation of brain delivery, dose-dependent protein expression was quantified in multiple brain areas 48 h after dosing; with protein expression seen mainly in the cerebral cortex and striatum and following expression levels: cerebral cortex = olfactory bulb > striatum > brain stem > mid brain = cerebellum. No protein expression was observed in the liver and lungs of dosed animals. GC-DNA protein expression was not significantly different to that observed with Lipofectamine 2000. These results demonstrate that GC-DNA nanoparticles are able to deliver genes preferably to specific brain regions such as the cerebral cortex and striatum; offering the possibility of using genes to treat a range of neurological disorders using a non-invasive method of dosing.",

The ketogenic diet, which bypasses glycolysis, is a promising remedy for patients with refractory SE. We tested the role of glycolytic lactate production in sustaining SE. Extracellular lactate and glucose concentration during a seizure and SE in vivo was measured using lactate and glucose biosensors. A lactate dehydrogenase inhibitor, oxamate, blocked pyruvate to lactate conversion during SE. Video-EEG recordings evaluated seizure duration, severity, and immunohistochemistry was used to determine neuronal loss. Genetically encoded calcium indicator GCaMP7 was used to study the effect of oxamate on CA1 pyramidal neurons in vitro. Spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSCs) were recorded from CA1 neurons to study oxamate's impact on neurotransmission. The extracellular glucose concentration dropped rapidly during seizures, and lactate accumulated in the extracellular space. Inhibition of pyruvate to lactate conversion with oxamate terminated SE in mice. There was less neuronal loss in treated compared to control mice. Oxamate perfusion decreased tonic and phasic neuronal activity of GCaMP7-expressing CA1 pyramidal neurons in vitro. Oxamate application reduced the frequency, but not amplitude of sEPSCs recorded from CA1 neurons, suggesting an effect on the presynaptic glutamatergic neurotransmission. A single seizure and SE stimulate lactate production. Diminishing pyruvate to lactate conversion with oxamate terminated SE and reduced associated neuronal death. Oxamate reduced neuronal excitability and excitatory neurotransmission at the presynaptic terminal. Glycolytic lactate production sustains SE and is an attractive therapeutic target.",

        "abstract": "Zika virus (ZIKV) is a type of RNA virus that belongs to the Flaviviridae family. We have reported the construction of a DNA-launched replicon of the Asian-lineage Natal RGN strain and the production of single-round infectious particles (SRIPs) via the combination of prM/E virus-like particles with the replicon. The main objective of the study was to engineer the ZIKV replicon as mammalian expression vectors and evaluate the potential of ZIKV mini-replicon-based SRIPs as delivery vehicles for heterologous gene expression in vitro and in vivo. The mini-replicons contained various genetic elements, including NS4B, an NS5 methyltransferase (MTase) domain, and an NS5 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) domain. Among these mini-replicons, only ZIKV mini-replicons 2 and 3, which contained the full NS5 and NS4B-NS5 genetic elements, respectively, exhibited the expression of reporters (green fluorescent protein (GFP) and cyan fluorescent protein-yellow fluorescent fusion protein (CYP)) and generated self-replicating RNAs. When the mini-replicons were transfected into the cells expressing ZIKV prM/E, this led to the production of ZIKV mini-replicon-based SRIPs. ZIKV mini-replicon 3 SRIPs showed a significantly higher yield titer and a greater abundance of self-replicating replicon RNAs when compared to ZIKV mini-replicon 2 SRIPs. Additionally, there were disparities in the dynamics of CYP expression and cytotoxic effects observed in various infected cell types between ZIKV mini-replicon 2-CYP and 3-CYP SRIPs. In particular, ZIKV mini-replicon 3-CYP SRIPs led to a substantial decrease in the survival rates of infected cells at a MOI of 2. An in vivo gene expression assay indicated that hACE2 expression was detected in the lung and brain tissues of mice following the intravenous administration of ZIKV mini-replicon 3-hACE2 SRIPs. Overall, this study highlights the potential of ZIKV mini-replicon-based SRIPs as promising vehicles for gene delivery applications in vitro and in vivo.",

To help bridge these knowledge gaps, we developed the first ever recombinant strain of CyHV-2 expressing bioluminescent and fluorescent reporter genes. Infection of <i>Carassius auratus</i> hosts with this recombinant by immersion facilitated the exploitation of various in vivo imaging techniques to establish the spatiotemporal aspects of CyHV-2 replication at larval, juvenile, and adult developmental stages. While less susceptible than later developmental stages, larvae were most permissive to CyHV-2 replication, leading to rapid systemic infection and high mortality. Permissivity to CyHV-2 decreased with advancing development, with adults being the least permissive and, thus, also exhibiting the least mortality. Across all developmental stages, the skin was the most susceptible and permissive organ to infection at the earliest sampling points post-infection, indicating that it represents the major portal of entry into these hosts. Collectively these findings provide important fundamental insights into CyHV-2 pathogenesis and epidemiology in <i>Carassius auratus</i> with high relevance to other related economically important virus-host models.",

        "abstract": "Demand for spare parts, which is triggered by element failure, project schedule and reliability demand, etc., is a kind of sensing data to the aftermarket service of large manufacturing enterprises. Prediction of the demand for spare parts plays a crucial role in inventory management and lifecycle quality management for the aftermarket service of large-scale manufacturing enterprises. In real-life applications, however, demand for spare parts occurs randomly and fluctuates greatly, and the demand sequence shows obvious intermittent distribution characteristics. Additionally, due to factors such as reporting mistakes made by personnel or environmental changes, the actual data of the demand for spare parts are prone to abnormal variations. It is thus hard to capture the evolutional pattern of the demand for spare parts by traditional time series forecasting methods. The reliability of prediction results is also reduced. To address these concerns, this paper proposes a tensor optimization-based robust interval prediction method of intermittent time series for the aftersales demand for spare parts. First, using the advantages of tensor decomposition to effectively mine intrinsic information from raw data, a sequence-smoothing network based on tensor decomposition and a stacked autoencoder is proposed. Tucker decomposition is applied to the hidden features of the encoder, and the obtained core tensor is reconstructed through the decoder, thus allowing us to smooth outliers in the original demand sequence. An alternating optimization algorithm is further designed to find the optimal sequence feature representation and tensor decomposition factors for the extraction of the evolutionary trend of the intermittent series. Second, an adaptive interval prediction algorithm with a dynamic update mechanism is designed to obtain point prediction values and prediction intervals for the demand sequence, thereby improving the reliability of the forecast. The proposed method is validated using the actual aftersales data from a large engineering manufacturing enterprise in China. The experimental results demonstrate that, compared with typical time series prediction methods, the proposed method can effectively grab the evolutionary trend of various intermittent series and improve the accuracy of predictions made with small-sample intermittent series. Moreover, the proposed method provides a reliable elastic prediction interval when distortion occurs in the prediction results, offering a new solution for intelligent planning decisions related to spare parts in practical maintenance.",

Smart fiber composed of shape memory alloy (SMA) generates deformation when the electric current is applied, causing the phase transformation of SMA. We fabricated the smart chain column and evaluated its actuating mechanism based on the size of the chain and the number of rows. In addition, a crochet textile actuator was designed using interlooping smart chains and developed into a soft gripper that can grab objects. With experimental verifications, this study provides an investigation of the relationship between the chain actuator's deformation, actuating force, actuator temperature, and strain. The results of this study are expected to be relevant to textile applications, wearable devices, and other technical fields that require coordination with the human body.

        "abstract": "Ca<sup>2+</sup> leak from cardiomyocyte sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) via hyperactive resting cardiac ryanodine receptor channels (RyR2) is pro-arrhythmic. An exogenous peptide (DPc10) binding promotes leaky RyR2 in cardiomyocytes and reports on that endogenous state. Conversely, calmodulin (CaM) binding inhibits RyR2 leak and low CaM affinity is diagnostic of leaky RyR2. These observations have led to designing a FRET biosensor for drug discovery targeting RyR2. We used FRET to clarify the molecular mechanism driving the DPc10-CaM interdependence when binding RyR2 in SR vesicles. We used donor-FKBP12.6 (D-FKBP) to resolve RyR2 binding of acceptor-CaM (A-CaM). In low nanomolar Ca<sup>2+</sup>, DPc10 decreased both FRET<sub>max</sub> (under saturating [A-CaM]) and the CaM/RyR2 binding affinity. In micromolar Ca<sup>2+</sup>, DPc10 decreased FRET<sub>max</sub> without affecting CaM/RyR2 binding affinity. This correlates with the analysis of fluorescence-lifetime-detected FRET, indicating that DPc10 lowers occupancy of the RyR2 CaM-binding sites in nanomolar (not micromolar) Ca<sup>2+</sup> and lengthens D-FKBP/A-CaM distances independent of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]. To observe DPc10/RyR2 binding, we used acceptor-DPc10 (A-DPc10). CaM weakens A-DPc10/RyR2 binding, with this effect being larger in micromolar versus nanomolar Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Moreover, A-DPc10/RyR2 binding is cooperative in a CaM- and FKBP-dependent manner, suggesting that both endogenous modulators promote concerted structural changes between RyR2 protomers for channel regulation. Aided by the analysis of cryo-EM structures, these insights inform further development of the DPc10-CaM paradigm for therapeutic discovery targeting RyR2.",

In a pilot study, we observed unexpected phenotypes using this mouse strain, which prompted an extensive characterization of Cyp19-Cre placental phenotypes using ROSA<sup>mT/mG</sup> transgenic reporter mice. The two strains were mated to generate bi-transgenic Cyp19-Cre;ROSA<sup>mT/mG</sup> mice following a standard transgenic breeding scheme, and placental and fetal tissues were analyzed on embryonic day 17.5. Both maternal and paternal Cre inheritance were analyzed by mating the respective Cyp19-Cre and ROSA<sup>mT/mG</sup> males and females. The genotype results showed the expected percentage of Cyp19-Cre;ROSA<sup>mT/mG</sup> fetuses (73%) and Cre mRNA was expressed in all of the Cyp19-Cre placentas. However, surprisingly, only about 50% of the Cyp19-Cre;ROSA<sup>mT/mG</sup> placentas showed Cre-mediated recombinase activity as demonstrated by placental enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) expression. Further genetic excision analysis of the placentas revealed consistent results showing the absence of excision of the tdTomato in all of the Cyp19-Cre;ROSA<sup>mT/mG</sup> placentas lacking EGFP expression. Moreover, among the EGFP-expressing placentas, there was wide variability in recombination efficiency, even in placentas from the same litter, leading to a mosaic pattern of EGFP expression in different zones and cell types of the placentas. In addition, we observed a significantly higher percentage of Cre recombination activity in placentas with maternal Cre inheritance. Our results show frequent mosaicism, inconsistent recombination activity, and parent-of-origin effects in placentas from Cyp19-Cre;ROSA<sup>mT/mG</sup> mice, suggesting that tail-biopsy genotype results may not necessarily indicate the excision of floxed genes in Cyp19-Cre positive placentas. Thus, placenta-specific mutagenesis studies using the Cyp19-Cre model require extensive characterization and careful interpretation of the placental phenotypes for each floxed allele.",

The processing of the images was carried out with the Color Grab application. Finally, the absorbance values were calculated using the RGB intensity values of blank, standard, and sample solutions.

This vector has high therapeutic versatility with the ability to deliver genetic payloads to a variety of human tissue types, yet there is currently a lack of transgene expression control once the virus is administered. There are also times when transgene expression is too low for the desired therapeutic outcome, necessitating high viral dose administration resulting in possible immunological complications. Herein, we validate a chemically controllable AAV transgene expression technology <i>in vitro</i> that utilizes bifunctional molecules known as chemical epigenetic modifiers (CEMs). These compounds employ endogenous epigenetic machinery to specifically enhance transgene expression of episomal DNA. A recombinant AAV (rAAV) was designed to both deliver the reporter transgene as well as deliver a synthetic zinc finger (ZFs) protein fused to FK506 binding protein (FKBP). These synthetic ZFs target a DNA-binding array sequence upstream of the promoter expressing the AAV transgene to specifically enhance AAV transgene expression in the presence of a CEM. The transcriptional activating compound CEM87 functions by recruiting the epigenetic transcription activator bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4), increasing AAV transgene activity up to fivefold in a dose-dependent manner in HEK293T cells. The highest levels of transgene product activity are seen 24 h following CEM87 treatment. Additionally, the CEM87-mediated enhancement of different transgene products with either Luciferase or green fluorescent protein (GFP) was observed in multiple cell lines and enhancement of transgene expression was capsid serotype independent. The impact of CEM87 activity can be disrupted through drug removal or chemical recruitment site competition with FK506, thus demonstrating the reversibility of the impact of CEM87 on transgene expression. Collectively, this chemically controllable rAAV transgene technology provides temporal gene expression control that could increase the safety and efficiency of AAV-based research and therapies.",

The key facilitators in the design of such a natural UX are that the interaction has zero lag and that users experience no excess mental load. This is difficult to achieve due to technical constraints such as motion-to-photon latency as well as false-positives during gesture-based interaction. In this paper, we explored the use of physiological features to model the user's intent to interact with a virtual reality (VR) environment. Accurate predictions about when users want to express an interaction intent could overcome the limitations of an interactive device that lags behind the intention of a user. We computed time-domain features from electroencephalography (EEG) and electromyography (EMG) recordings during a grab-and-drop task in VR and cross-validated a Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) for three different combinations of (1) EEG, (2) EMG and (3) EEG-EMG features. We found the classifiers to detect the presence of a pre-movement state from background idle activity reflecting the users' intent to interact with the virtual objects (EEG: 62 % ± 10 %, EMG: 72 % ± 9 %, EEG-EMG: 69 % ± 10 %) above simulated chance level. The features leveraged in our classification scheme have a low computational cost and are especially useful for fast decoding of users' mental states. Our work is a further step towards a useful classification of users' intent to interact, as a high temporal resolution and speed of detection is crucial.

This paper proposes a metaheuristic algorithm for continuous and constrained global optimization problems, which combines the MOA, the Aquila Optimizer (AO), and the opposition-based learning (OBL) strategy, called AOBLMOA, to overcome the shortcomings of the MOA. The proposed algorithm first fuses the high soar with vertical stoop method and the low flight with slow descent attack method in the AO into the position movement process of the male mayfly population in the MOA. Then, it incorporates the contour flight with short glide attack and the walk and grab prey methods in the AO into the positional movement of female mayfly populations in the MOA. Finally, it replaces the gene mutation behavior of offspring mayfly populations in the MOA with the OBL strategy. To verify the optimization ability of the new algorithm, we conduct three sets of experiments. In the first experiment, we apply AOBLMOA to 19 benchmark functions to test whether it is the optimal strategy among multiple combined strategies. In the second experiment, we test AOBLMOA by using 30 CEC2017 numerical optimization problems and compare it with state-of-the-art metaheuristic algorithms. In the third experiment, 10 CEC2020 real-world constrained optimization problems are used to demonstrate the applicability of AOBLMOA to engineering design problems.

Due to the enhanced spectral separation between donor and acceptor emission and the availability of a stable substrate for NLuc, this donor-acceptor pair enables sensitive kinetic assessment of G protein activity. After optimization, the NLuc integration sites into the Gα subunit largely corresponded with previously reported integration sites, except for Gα<sub>Ss/L</sub> for which we describe an alternative NLuc insertion site. G protein rescue experiments validated the biological activity of these Gα donor proteins. Direct comparison between EGFP and LSS-mKATE2 as acceptor fluorophores revealed improved sensitivity for nearly all G protein subtypes when using the latter one. Hence, REGA-SIGN can be used as a panel of kinetic G protein biosensors with high sensitivity.",

Regional data from Tayside, Scotland, showed that only 55% of children who were eligible for free school meals took these (normal uptake pre-pandemic was 66%). The current work aimed to identify teachers' perceptions of meal provisioning in primary schools during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. A cross-sectional online survey was carried out among primary school teachers across Tayside, Scotland. Using an online survey (21 questions combining multiple choice formats and open text) and interviews, primary school teachers shared their views on food quality, quantity, meal choices and factors influencing uptake of primary school lunches. Interviews were recorded, transcribed and thematically analysed with respect to factors influencing consumption. The survey was completed by 41 teachers and 8 participated in a follow up interview. Around one-third (29%) of primary school teachers believed the quality of lunches had decreased and cited poor appearance of food, use of takeaway containers and food wastage. The lunch format was viewed negatively principally relating to the substitution of hot lunches with cold sandwiches, portion sizes, choice and perceived value for money. Concerns were expressed about acceptability and how far the meals contributed to food security. Further work on food provisioning is needed in order to identify ways to provide a nutritional safety net for vulnerable children.",

        "abstract": "Chemogenetic tools provide an opportunity to manipulate neuronal activity and behavior selectively and repeatedly in nonhuman primates (NHPs) with minimal invasiveness. Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs) are one example that is based on mutated muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. Another channel-based chemogenetic system available for neuronal modulation in NHPs uses pharmacologically selective actuator modules (PSAMs), which are selectively activated by pharmacologically selective effector molecules (PSEMs). To facilitate the use of the PSAM/PSEM system, the selection and dosage of PSEMs should be validated and optimized for NHPs. To this end, we used a multimodal imaging approach. We virally expressed excitatory PSAM (PSAM4-5HT3) in the striatum and the primary motor cortex (M1) of two male macaque monkeys, and visualized its location through positron emission tomography (PET) with the reporter ligand [<sup>18</sup>F]ASEM. Chemogenetic excitability of neurons triggered by two PSEMs (uPSEM817 and uPSEM792) was evaluated using [<sup>18</sup>F]fluorodeoxyglucose-PET imaging, with uPSEM817 being more efficient than uPSEM792. Pharmacological magnetic resonance imaging (phMRI) showed that increased brain activity in the PSAM4-expressing region began ∼13 min after uPSEM817 administration and continued for at least 60 min. Our multimodal imaging data provide valuable information regarding the manipulation of neuronal activity using the PSAM/PSEM system in NHPs, facilitating future applications.<b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Like other chemogenetic tools, the ion channel-based system called pharmacologically selective actuator module/pharmacologically selective effector molecule (PSAM/PSEM) allows remote manipulation of neuronal activity and behavior in living animals. Nevertheless, its application in nonhuman primates (NHPs) is still limited. Here, we used multitracer positron emission tomography (PET) imaging and pharmacological magnetic resonance imaging (phMRI) to visualize an excitatory chemogenetic ion channel (PSAM4-5HT3) and validate its chemometric function in macaque monkeys. Our results provide the optimal agonist, dose, and timing for chemogenetic neuronal manipulation, facilitating the use of the PSAM/PSEM system and expanding the flexibility and reliability of circuit manipulation in NHPs in a variety of situations.",

        "abstract": "DRAM1 is an infection inducible autophagy modulator, previously shown to promote autophagic and lysosomal defense responses against the intracellular pathogen <i>Mycobacterium marinum</i>. However, its possible role in other anti-bacterial autophagic mechanisms remains unknown. Recently, LC3-associated phagocytosis (LAP) has emerged as autophagy-related mechanism that targets bacteria directly in phagosomes. Our previous work established LAP as the main autophagic mechanism by which macrophages restrict growth of <i>Salmonella</i> Typhimurium in a systemically infected zebrafish host. We therefore employed this infection model to investigate the possible role of Dram1 in LAP. Morpholino knockdown or CRISPR/Cas9-mediated mutation of Dram1 led to reduced host survival and increased bacterial burden during <i>S</i>. Typhimurium infection. In contrast, overexpression of <i>dram1</i> by mRNA injection curtailed <i>Salmonella</i> replication and reduced mortality of the infected host. During the early response to infection, GFP-Lc3-<i>Salmonella</i> associations were reduced in <i>dram1</i> knockdown or mutant embryos, and increased by <i>dram1</i> overexpression. Since LAP is known to require the activity of the phagosomal NADPH oxidase, we used a <i>Salmonella</i> biosensor strain to detect bacterial exposure to reactive oxygen species (ROS) and found that the ROS response was largely abolished with deficiency of <i>dram1</i>, while it was increased with <i>dram1</i> overexpression. Corroborating these results in a mammalian model, the LC3 and ROS responses to <i>Salmonella</i> were similarly reduced or increased by knockdown or overexpression of <i>Dram1</i>, respectively, in murine RAW264.7 macrophages. Together, these results demonstrate the host protective role of Dram1/DRAM1 during <i>S</i>. Typhimurium infection and suggest a functional link between Dram1/DRAM1 and the induction of LAP. <b>Abbreviations:</b> ATG8: Autophagy related protein 8; ATG16: Autophagy related protein 16; CFU: colony-forming unit; DRAM1: DNA damage regulated autophagy modulator gene 1; dpf: days post fertilization; GFP: green fluorescent protein; hpi: hours post infection; LAP: LC3 associated phagocytosis; LC3, microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3; NADPH: Nicotinamide dinucleotide phosphate; p53: Tumor suppressor protein 53: ROS; reactive oxygen species; <i>S</i>.

        "abstract": "Oxidative stress is the consequence of an abnormal increase of reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS are generated mainly during the metabolism in both normal and pathological conditions as well as from exposure to xenobiotics. Xenobiotics can, on the one hand, disrupt molecular machinery involved in redox processes and, on the other hand, reduce the effectiveness of the antioxidant activity. Such dysregulation may lead to oxidative damage when combined with oxidative stress overpassing the cell capacity to detoxify ROS. In this work, a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2)-regulated sulfiredoxin reporter (Srxn1-GFP) was used to measure the antioxidant response of HepG2 cells to a large series of drug and drug-like compounds (2230 compounds). These compounds were then classified as positive or negative depending on cellular response and distributed among different modeling groups to establish structure-activity relationship (SAR) models. A selection of models was used to prospectively predict oxidative stress induced by a new set of compounds subsequently experimentally tested to validate the model predictions. Altogether, this exercise exemplifies the different challenges of developing SAR models of a phenotypic cellular readout, model combination, chemical space selection, and results interpretation.",

        "abstract": "Inhibitory neurons embedded within mammalian neural circuits shape breathing, walking, chewing, and other rhythmic motor behaviors. At the core of the neural circuit controlling breathing is the preBötzinger Complex (preBötC), a nucleus in the ventrolateral medulla necessary for generation of inspiratory rhythm. In the preBötC, a recurrently connected network of glutamatergic Dbx1-derived (Dbx1 <sup>+</sup> ) neurons generates rhythmic inspiratory drive. Functionally and anatomically intercalated among Dbx1 <sup>+</sup> preBötC neurons are GABAergic (GAD1/2 <sup>+</sup> ) and glycinergic (GlyT2 <sup>+</sup> ) neurons, whose roles in breathing remain unclear. To elucidate the inhibitory microcircuits within preBötC, we first characterized the spatial distribution of molecularly-defined inhibitory preBötC subpopulations in double reporter mice expressing either the red fluorescent protein tdTomato or EGFP in GlyT2 <sup>+</sup> , GAD1 <sup>+</sup> , or GAD2 <sup>+</sup> neurons. We found that, in postnatal mice, the majority of inhibitory preBötC neurons expressed a combination of GlyT2 and GAD2 while a much smaller subpopulation also expressed GAD1. To determine the functional role of these subpopulations, we used holographic photostimulation, a patterned illumination technique with high spatiotemporal resolution, in rhythmically active medullary slices from neonatal Dbx1 <sup>tdTomato</sup> ;GlyT2 <sup>EGFP</sup> and Dbx1 <sup>tdTomato</sup> ;GAD1 <sup>EGFP</sup> double reporter mice. Stimulation of 4 or 8 preBötC GlyT2 <sup>+</sup> neurons during endogenous rhythm prolonged the interburst interval in a phase-dependent manner and increased the latency to burst initiation when bursts were evoked by stimulation of Dbx1 <sup>+</sup> neurons. In contrast, stimulation of 4 or 8 preBötC GAD1 <sup>+</sup> neurons did not affect interburst interval or latency to burst initiation. Instead, photoactivation of GAD1 <sup>+</sup> neurons during the inspiratory burst prolonged endogenous and evoked burst duration and decreased evoked burst amplitude. We conclude that the majority of preBötC inhibitory neurons express both GlyT2 and GAD2 and modulate breathing rhythm by delaying burst initiation while a smaller GAD1 <sup>+</sup> subpopulation shapes inspiratory patterning by altering burst duration and amplitude.",

At least 5 ng of Hg mass is required for Hg isotopic analysis. Given the low Hg concentration in natural waters, a large volume of water (>10 L) is typically needed. The conventional grab sampling method is time-consuming, laborious, and prone to contamination during transportation and preconcentration steps. In this study, a DGT (diffusive gradients in thin films) method based on aminopropyl and mercaptopropyl bi-functionalized SBA-15 nanoparticles was developed and extended to determine the concentration and isotopic composition of aqueous Hg for the first time. The results of laboratory analysis showed that Hg adsorption by DGT induces ∼ -0.2‰ mass-dependent fractionation (MDF) and little mass-independent fractionation (MIF). The magnitude of MDF exhibits a dependence on the diffusion-layer thickness of DGT. Since Hg-MDF can occur in a broad range of environmental processes, monitoring the δ<sup>202</sup>Hg of aqueous Hg using the DGT method should be performed with caution. Field results show consistent MIF signatures (Δ<sup>199</sup>Hg) between the DGT and conventional grab sampling method. The developed DGT method serves as a passive sampling method that effectively characterizes the MIF of Hg in waters to understand the biogeochemical cycle of Hg at contaminated sites.",

To address this challenge, we developed an imaging system capable of efficient, high-contrast GEVI imaging at near-kHz rates and demonstrate it for in vivo and ex vivo imaging applications in the mouse neocortex. Our approach uses simultaneous multiplane imaging to monitor activity within contiguous tissue volumes with no penalty in speed or requirement for high excitation power. This approach, multi-Z imaging with confocal detection (MuZIC), permits high signal-to-noise ratio voltage imaging in densely labeled neuronal populations and is compatible with imaging through micro-optics. Moreover, it minimizes artifacts associated with concurrent imaging and optogenetic photostimulation for all-optical electrophysiology.",

We sought to determine the role of IgA immune complexes for therapeutic application to mucosal allergic responses. Trinitrophenol (TNP)-specific IgA immune complexes were applied, using TNP-coupled ovalbumin (OVA), to airway and gut mucosal surfaces in systemically sensitized allergic animals to regulate allergen challenge responses. Animals were assessed for both pathologic and immune-mediated responses in the lung and gut, respectively, using established mouse models. The mucosal application of IgA immune complexes in the lung and gut with TNP-OVA regulated T<sub>H</sub>2-driven allergic response in the lung and gut, reducing T<sub>H</sub>2 cytokines and mucus (lung) as well as diarrhea and temperature loss (gut), but increasing IL-10 and the number of regulatory T cells. The IgA-OVA immune complex did not alter peanut-induced anaphylaxis, indicating antigen specificity. Using OVA-specific DO.11-green fluorescent protein IL-4 reporter mouse-derived T<sub>H</sub>2-skewed cells in a transfer model demonstrated that mucosal IgA immune complex treatment reduced T<sub>H</sub>2-cell expansion and increased the number of regulatory T cells. To address a potential mechanism of action, TGF-β and IL-10 were induced in bone marrow-derived dendritic cells when they were exposed to IgA immune complex, suggesting a regulatory phenotype induced in dendritic cells that also led to an altered primary T-cell-mediated response in in vitro OVA-specific assays. These studies highlight one possible mechanism of how allergen-specific IgA may provide a regulatory signal to reduce the development of allergic responses in the lung and gut.",

        "abstract": "Hybrid voltage indicators (HVIs) are chemogenetic sensors that combines the superior photophysical properties of organic dyes and the genetic targetability of protein sensors to report transient membrane voltage changes. They exhibit boosted sensitivity in excitable cells such as neurons and cardiomyocytes. However, the voltage signals recorded during long-term imaging are severely diminished or distorted due to phototoxicity and photobleaching issues. To capture stable electrophysiological activities over a long time, we employ cyanine dyes conjugated with a cyclooctatetraene (COT) molecule as the fluorescence reporter of HVI. The resulting orange-emitting HVI-COT-Cy3 enables high-fidelity voltage imaging for up to 30 min in cultured primary neurons with a sensitivity of ~ -30% ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> per action potential (AP). It also maximally preserves the signal of individual APs in cardiomyocytes. The far-red-emitting HVI-COT-Cy5 allows two-color voltage/calcium imaging with GCaMP6s in neurons and cardiomyocytes for 15 min. We leverage the HVI-COT series with reduced phototoxicity and photobleaching to evaluate the impact of drug candidates on the electrophysiology of excitable cells.",

Ames assay is the existing gold standard method. However, the pathogenic bacteria model lacks metabolic enzymes and requires mass GTIs, leading to insufficient safety, accuracy, and sensitivity. Whole-cell microbial sensors (WCMSs) can use normal strains to simulate the metabolic environment, achieving safe, sensitive, and high-throughput detection and evaluation for GTIs. Here, based on whether GTIs causing DNA alkylation required metabolic enzymes or not, two DNA repair-responsive engineered WCMS systems were constructed including <i>Escherichia coli</i>-WCMS and yeast-WCMS. A DNA repair-responsive promoter as a sensing element was coupled with an enhanced green fluorescent protein as a reporter to construct plasmids for introduction into WCMS. The <i>ada</i> promoter was screened out in the <i>E. coli</i>-WCMS, while the <i>MAG1</i> promoter was selected for the yeast-WCMS. Different <i>E. coli</i> and yeast strains were modified by gene knockout and mutation to eliminate the interference and enhance the GTI retention in cells and further improved the sensitivity. Finally, GTI consumption of WCMS for the evaluation of methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) and nitrosamines was decreased to 0.46-8.53 μg and 0.068 ng-2.65 μg, respectively, decreasing 2-3 orders of magnitude compared to traditional methods. This study provided a novel approach to measure GTIs with different DNA damage pathways at a molecular level and facilitated the high-throughput screening and sensitive evaluation of GTIs.",

The objective of this study is to validate the use of in situ probes for the detection and management of cyanobacterial breakthrough in high and low-risk DWTPs. In situ phycocyanin YSI EXO2 probes were devised for remote control and data logging to monitor the cyanobacteria in raw, clarified, filtered, and treated water in three full-scale DWTPs. An additional probe was installed inside the sludge holding tank to measure the water quality of the surface of the sludge storage tank in a high-risk DWTP. Simultaneous grab samplings were carried out for taxonomic cell counts and toxin analysis. A total of 23, 9, and 4 field visits were conducted at the three DWTPs. Phycocyanin readings showed a 93-fold fluctuation within 24 h in the raw water of the high cyanobacterial risk plant, with higher phycocyanin levels during the afternoon period. These data provide new information on the limitations of weekly or daily grab sampling. Also, different moving averages for the phycocyanin probe readings can be used to improve the interpretation of phycocyanin signal trends. The in situ probe successfully detected high cyanobacterial biovolumes entering the clarification process in the high-risk plant. Grab sampling results revealed high cyanobacterial biovolumes in the sludge for both high and low-risk plants.",

Previously, we developed a protocol for the generation of a novel population of regulatory B cells, which are characterized by secretion of enzymatically active granzyme B (<i>GraB cells</i>). This protocol uses recombinant interleukin 21 (IL-21) and goat-derived F(ab)'2 fragments against the human B cell receptor (anti-BCR). Generally, the use of xenogeneic material for the manufacturing of advanced therapy medicinal products should be avoided to prevent adverse immune reactions as well as potential transmission of so far unknown diseases. In the present work we demonstrated that phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA/TPA), a phorbol ester with a particular analogy to the second messenger diacylglycerol (DAG), is a potent enhancer of IL-21-induced differentiation of pre-activated B cells into <i>GraB cells</i>. The percentage of <i>GraB cells</i> after stimulation of pre-activated B cells with IL-21 and PMA/TPA was not significantly lower compared to stimulation with IL-21 and anti-BCR. Given that PMA/TPA has already undergone encouraging clinical testing in patients with certain haematological diseases, our results suggest that PMA/TPA may be a safe and feasible alternative for <i>ex-vivo</i> manufacturing of <i>GraB cells</i>.",

        "abstract": "Cellular physiology has been mainly studied by using two-dimensional cell culture substrates which lack in vivo-mimicking extracellular environment and interactions. Thus, there is a growing need for more complex model systems in life sciences. Micro-engineered scaffolds have been proven to be a promising tool in understanding the role of physical cues in the co-regulation of cellular functions. These tools allow, for example, probing cell morphology and migration in response to changes in chemo-physical properties of their microenvironment. In order to understand how microtopographical features, what cells encounter in vivo, affect cytoskeletal organization and nuclear mechanics, we used direct laser writing via two-photon polymerization (TPP) to fabricate substrates which contain different surface microtopographies. By combining with advanced high-resolution spectral imaging, we describe how the constructed grid and vertical line microtopographies influence cellular alignment, nuclear morphology and mechanics. Specifically, we found that growing cells on grids larger than 10 × 20 μm<sup>2</sup> and on vertical lines increased 3D actin cytoskeleton orientation along the walls of microtopographies and abolished basal actin stress fibers. In concert, the nuclei of these cells were also more aligned, elongated, deformed and less flattened, indicating changes in nuclear force transduction. Importantly, by using fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy for measuring Förster resonance energy transfer for a genetically encoded nesprin-2 molecular tension sensor, we show that growing cells on these microtopographic substrates induce lower mechanical tension at the nuclear envelope. To conclude, here used substrate microtopographies modulated the cellular mechanics, and affected actin organization and nuclear force transduction.",

Simultaneous GCaMP and intrinsic optical imaging allowed tracking of both neuronal and hemodynamic changes. During hypoxic conditions, we found a global increase of both HbO and HbR in the brain. The saturation levels of blood dropped after the onset of hypoxia, but surprisingly climbed back to levels similar to baseline within the 10-min hypoxia period. Neuronal activity also showed a peak at the onset of hypoxia, but dropped back to baseline as well. Despite regaining baseline sO2 levels, changes in neuronal RSN were observed. In particular, the connectivity as measured with GCaMP between anterior and posterior parts of the brain decreased. In contrast, when looking at these same connections with HbO measurements, an increase in connectivity in anterior-posterior brain areas was observed suggesting a potential neurovascular decoupling.",

For these living cells to report detected biomarkers or signals after exiting the gut, the genetic circuits must be able to record these signals by using genetically encoded memory. Complex memory register circuits could enable multiplex interrogation of biomarkers and signals. A theory-based approach to create genetic circuits containing memory, known as sequential logic circuits, was previously established for a model laboratory strain of <i>Escherichia coli</i>, yet how circuit component performance varies for nonmodel and clinically relevant bacterial strains is poorly understood. Here, we develop a scalable computational approach to design robust sequential logic circuits in probiotic strain <i>Escherichia coli</i> Nissle 1917 (EcN). In this work, we used TetR-family transcriptional repressors to build genetic logic gates that can be composed into sequential logic circuits, along with a set of engineered sensors relevant for use in the gut environment. Using standard methods, 16 genetic NOT gates and nine sensors were experimentally characterized in EcN. These data were used to design and predict the performance of circuit designs. We present a set of genetic circuits encoding both combinational logic and sequential logic and show that the circuit outputs are in close agreement with our quantitative predictions from the design algorithm. Furthermore, we demonstrate an analog-like concentration recording circuit that detects and reports three input concentration ranges of a biochemical signal using sequential logic.",

However, the role of KSRP in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) remains poorly understood. KSRP expression was detected by a ccRCC tissue microarray and evaluated by an in silico analysis. Cell loss-of-function and gain-of-function, colony-formation, anoikis, and transwell assays, and an orthotopic bioluminescent xenograft model were conducted to determine the functional role of KRSP in ccRCC progression. Micro (mi)RNA and complementary (c)DNA microarrays were used to identify downstream targets of KSRP. Western blotting, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, and promoter- and 3-untranslated region (3'UTR)-luciferase reporter assays were employed to validate the underlying mechanisms of KSRP which aggravate progression of ccRCC. Our results showed that dysregulated high levels of KSRP were correlated with advanced clinical stages, larger tumor sizes, recurrence, and poor prognoses of ccRCC. Neural precursor cell-expressed developmentally downregulated 4 like (NEDD4L) was identified as a novel target of KSRP, which can reverse the protumorigenic and prometastatic characteristics as well as epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) promotion by KSRP in vitro and in vivo. Molecular studies revealed that KSRP can decrease NEDD4L messenger (m)RNA stability via inducing mir-629-5p upregulation and directly targeting the AU-rich elements (AREs) of the 3'UTR. Moreover, KSRP was shown to transcriptionally suppress NEDD4L via inducing the transcriptional repressor, Wilm's tumor 1 (WT1). In the clinic, ccRCC samples revealed a positive correlation between KSRP and mesenchymal-related genes, and patients expressing high KSRP and low NEDD4L had the worst prognoses. The current findings unveil novel mechanisms of KSRP which promote malignant progression of ccRCC through transcriptional inhibition and post-transcriptional destabilization of NEDD4L transcripts. Targeting KSRP and its pathways may be a novel pharmaceutical intervention for ccRCC.",

        "abstract": "Genetically encoded optical indicators and actuators of neural activity allow for all-optical investigations of signaling in the nervous system. But commonly used indicators, actuators and expression strategies are poorly suited for systematic measurements of signal propagation at brain scale and cellular resolution. Large scale measurements of the brain require indicators and actuators with compatible excitation spectra to avoid optical crosstalk. They must be highly expressed in every neuron but at the same time avoid lethality and permit the animal to reach adulthood. And finally, their expression must be compatible with additional fluorescent labels to locate and identify neurons, such as those in the NeuroPAL cell identification system. We present TWISP, a Transgenic Worm for Interrogating Signal Propagation, that address these needs and enables optical measurements of evoked calcium activity at brain scale and cellular resolution in the nervous system of the nematode <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>. We express in every neuron a non-conventional optical actuator, the gustatory receptor homolog GUR-3+PRDX-2 under the control of a drug-inducible system QF+hGR, and calcium indicator GCAMP6s, in a background with additional fluorophores of the NeuroPAL cell ID system. We show that this combination, but not others tested, avoids optical-crosstalk, creates strong expression in the adult, and generates stable transgenic lines for systematic measurements of signal propagation in the worm brain.",

We use a pulse-chase approach with this reporter mouse system to measure the lifespans and division rates of naive CD4 and CD8 T cells using a variety of modeling approaches, and show that they are all consistent with estimates derived from other published methods. However we propose that to obtain unbiased parameter estimates and full measures of their uncertainty one should simultaneously model the timecourses of the frequencies of labeled cells within both the population of interest and its precursor.

        "abstract": "Intersectional genetics have yielded tremendous advances in our understanding of molecularly identified subpopulations and circuits within the dorsal horn in neuropathic pain. The authors tested the hypothesis that spinal µ opioid receptor-expressing neurons (Oprm1-expressing neurons) contribute to behavioral hypersensitivity and neuronal sensitization in the spared nerve injury model in mice. The authors coupled the use of Oprm1Cre transgenic reporter mice with whole cell patch clamp electrophysiology in lumbar spinal cord slices to evaluate the neuronal activity of Oprm1-expressing neurons in the spared nerve injury model of neuropathic pain. The authors used a chemogenetic approach to activate or inhibit Oprm1-expressing neurons, followed by the assessment of behavioral signs of neuropathic pain. The authors reveal that spared nerve injury yielded a robust neuroplasticity of Oprm1-expressing neurons. Spared nerve injury reduced Oprm1 gene expression in the dorsal horn as well as the responsiveness of Oprm1-expressing neurons to the selective µ agonist (D-Ala2, N-MePhe4, Gly-ol)-enkephalin (DAMGO). Spared nerve injury sensitized Oprm1-expressing neurons, as reflected by an increase in their intrinsic excitability (rheobase, sham 38.62 ± 25.87 pA [n = 29]; spared nerve injury, 18.33 ± 10.29 pA [n = 29], P = 0.0026) and spontaneous synaptic activity (spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic current frequency in delayed firing neurons: sham, 0.81 ± 0.67 Hz [n = 14]; spared nerve injury, 1.74 ± 1.68 Hz [n = 10], P = 0.0466), and light brush-induced coexpression of the immediate early gene product, Fos in laminae I to II (%Fos/tdTomato+: sham, 0.42 ± 0.57% [n = 3]; spared nerve injury, 28.26 ± 1.92% [n = 3], P = 0.0001). Chemogenetic activation of Oprm1-expressing neurons produced mechanical hypersensitivity in uninjured mice (saline, 2.91 ± 1.08 g [n = 6]; clozapine N-oxide, 0.65 ± 0.34 g [n = 6], P = 0.0006), while chemogenetic inhibition reduced behavioral signs of mechanical hypersensitivity (saline, 0.38 ± 0.37 g [n = 6]; clozapine N-oxide, 1.05 ± 0.42 g [n = 6], P = 0.0052) and cold hypersensitivity (saline, 6.89 ± 0.88 s [n = 5] vs. clozapine N-oxide, 2.31 ± 0.52 s [n = 5], P = 0.0017).

Two weeks following intracerebral delivery of either synthetic nanocapsules (NCs) containing CRISPR ribonucleoprotein targeting the tdTomato stop cassette or adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors expressing Cre recombinase, the brains were collected, and the presence of tdTomato was assessed in both the striatum and SN. <b>Results:</b> TdTomato expression was observed at the injection site in both the NC- and AAV-treated groups and typically colocalized with the neuronal marker NeuN. In the SN, tdTomato-positive fibers were present in the pars reticulata, and SNpr area expressing tdTomato correlated with the size of the striatal genome edited area. <b>Conclusion:</b> These results demonstrate <i>in vivo</i> anterograde axonal transport of reporter gene protein products to the SNpr following neuronal genome editing in the striatum.",

The structural dynamics that result from femtosecond optical excitation have contributions from vibrational and electronic processes and from reaction dynamics that involve the crossing through a conical intersection. The creation and progression of the ultrafast structural dynamics strongly depends on optical and molecular parameters. When using X-ray crystallography as a probe of ultrafast dynamics, the origin of the observed nuclear motions is not known. Now, high-resolution pump-probe X-ray crystallography reveals complex sub-ångström, ultrafast motions and hydrogen-bonding rearrangements in the active site of a fluorescent protein. However, we demonstrate that the measured motions are not part of the photoisomerization reaction but instead arise from impulsively driven coherent vibrational processes in the electronic ground state. A coherent-control experiment using a two-colour and two-pulse optical excitation strongly amplifies the X-ray crystallographic difference density, while it fully depletes the photoisomerization process. A coherent control mechanism was tested and confirmed the wave packets assignment.",

        "abstract": "Restoring function in chronic stages of spinal cord injury (SCI) has often been met with failure or reduced efficacy when regenerative strategies are delayed past the acute or sub-acute stages of injury. Restoring function in the chronically injured spinal cord remains a critical challenge. We found that a single injection of retrogradely transported adeno-associated viruses (AAVrg) to knockout the phosphatase and tensin homolog protein (PTEN) in chronic SCI can effectively target both damaged and spared axons and transiently restore locomotor functions in near-complete injury models. AAVrg's were injected to deliver cre recombinase and/or a red fluorescent protein (RFP) under the human Synapsin 1 promoter (hSyn1) into the spinal cords of C57BL/6 PTEN<sup>FloxΔ</sup>/<sup>Δ</sup> mice to knockout PTEN (PTEN-KO) in a severe thoracic SCI crush model at both acute and chronic time points. PTEN-KO improved locomotor abilities in both acute and chronic SCI conditions over a 9-week period. Regardless of whether treatment was initiated at the time of injury (acute), or three months after SCI (chronic), mice with limited hindlimb joint movement gained hindlimb weight support after treatment. Interestingly, functional improvements were not sustained beyond 9 weeks coincident with a loss of RFP reporter-gene expression and a near-complete loss of treatment-associated functional recovery by 6 months post-treatment. Treatment effects were also specific to severely injured mice; animals with weight support at the time of treatment lost function over a 6-month period. Retrograde tracing with Fluorogold revealed viable neurons throughout the motor cortex despite a loss of RFP expression at 9 weeks post-PTEN-KO. However, few Fluorogold labeled neurons were detected within the motor cortex at 6 months post-treatment. BDA labeling from the motor cortex revealed a dense corticospinal tract (CST) bundle in all groups except chronically treated PTEN-KO mice, indicating a potential long-term toxic effect of PTEN-KO to neurons in the motor cortex which was corroborated by a loss of β-tubulin III labeling above the lesion within spinal cords after PTEN-KO. PTEN-KO mice had significantly more β-tubulin III labeled axons within the lesion when treatment was delivered acutely, but not chronically post-SCI. In conclusion, we have found that using AAVrg's to knockout PTEN is an effective manipulation capable of restoring motor functions in chronic SCI and can enhance axon growth of currently unidentified axon populations when delivered acutely after injury. However, the long-term consequences of PTEN-KO on neuronal health and viability should be further explored.",

A series of green fluorescent protein chromophores with modified donor-acceptor structures, containing carbazole as an electron donor and various substituents including pyridine-vinyl (P1), phenol-vinyl (P2), N, N-dimethylaniline-vinyl (P3), and thiophene-vinyl (P4), have been synthesized and evaluated. Emission spectroscopy and theoretical calculations of P1-P4 indicate that P1 shows enhanced green fluorescence (λ<sub>em</sub> = 560 nm) by inhibiting its twisted intramolecular charge transfer in the presence of Ox-LDL. This feature allows the selection of P1 as a sensitive probe to directly visualize ferroptosis and Cu<sup>2+</sup> -mediated LDL oxidative aggregation via in situ formation of fluorophore-bound Ox-LDL in living cells. The red-emissive probe Pro-P1 (λ<sub>em</sub> = 660 nm) is prepared via borate protection of P1, which can be cleaved into P1 under high expression of HOCl and Ox-LDL condition at the lesion site, resulting in enhanced green emission.

Using plasmid containing the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein gene (with a D614G mutation), spike protein pseudotyped viral particles with a lentiviral core and green fluorescent protein reporter were constructed and used for transfecting ACE2-expressing HEK293T cells. Since these viral particles behave like their coronavirus counterparts, they are the ideal surrogates of native virions for studying viral entry into host cells. Our results showed that, once the surrogate pseudoviruses with spike protein encounter ACE2ED-tethered AuNRs, these virions are entrapped, resulting in decreased viral infection to ACE2-expressing HEK293T cells. Moreover, the effect of photothermolysis created by ACE2ED-tagged AuNRs under 808-nm NIR laser irradiation for 5 min led to viral breakdown. In summary, ACE2ED-tethered AuNRs with dual functions (virus decoy and destruction) could have an intriguing advantage in the treatment of diseases involving rapidly mutating viral species such as SARS-CoV-2.",

However, most existing DNA-based probes rely on fluorescence as the signal output, which can be problematic due to issues like autofluorescence and scattering when applied in complex biological materials such as living cells or tissues. Herein, we report the development of bioluminescent nucleic acid (bioLUNA) sensors that offer laser excitation-independent and ratiometric imaging of the target in vivo. The system is based on computational modelling and mutagenesis investigations of a genetic fusion between circular permutated Nano-luciferase (NLuc) and HaloTag, enabling the conjugation of the protein with a DNAzyme. In the presence of Zn<sup>2+</sup> , the DNAzyme sensor releases the fluorophore-labelled strand, leading to a reduction in bioluminescent resonance energy transfer (BRET) between the luciferase and fluorophore. Consequently, this process induces ratiometric changes in the bioluminescent signal. We demonstrated that this bioLUNA sensor enabled imaging of both exogenous Zn<sup>2+</sup> in vivo and endogenous Zn<sup>2+</sup> efflux in normal epithelial prostate and prostate tumors. This work expands the DNAzyme sensors to using bioluminescence and thus has enriched the toolbox of nucleic acid sensors for a broad range of biomedical applications.",

The aim of this study was to explore the effective target of 18β-GRA in the treatment of GC, in order to provide effective ideas for the clinical prevention and treatment of GC. To investigate the mechanism of 18β-GRA in inhibiting cell proliferation and promoting autophagy flux in GC cells. Whole transcriptomic analyses were used to analyze and screen differentially expressed microRNAs (miRNAs) in GC cells after 18β-GRA intervention. Lentivirus-transfected GC cells and the Cell Counting Kit-8 were used to detect cell proliferation ability, cell colony formation ability was detected by the clone formation assay, and flow cytometry was used to detect the cell cycle and apoptosis. A nude mouse transplantation tumor model of GC cells was constructed to verify the effect of miR-328-3p overexpression on the tumorigenicity of GC cells. Tumor tissue morphology was observed by hematoxylin and eosin staining, and microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3) expression was detected by immunohistochemistry. TransmiR, STRING, and miRWalk databases were used to predict the relationship between miR-328-3p and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3)-related information. Expression of <i>STAT3</i> mRNA and <i>miR-328-3p</i> was detected by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and the expression levels of STAT3, phosphorylated STAT3 (p-STAT3), and LC3 were detected by western blot analysis. The targeted relationship between <i>miR-328-3p</i> and <i>STAT3</i> was detected using the dual-luciferase reporter gene system. AGS cells were infected with monomeric red fluorescent protein-green fluorescent protein-LC3 adenovirus double label. LC3 was labeled and autophagy flow was observed under a confocal laser microscope. The expression of miR-328-3p was significantly upregulated after 18β-GRA intervention in AGS cells (<i>P</i> = 4.51E-06). Overexpression of miR-328-3p inhibited GC cell proliferation and colony formation ability, arrested the cell cycle in the G0/G1 phase, promoted cell apoptosis, and inhibited the growth of subcutaneous tumors in BALB/c nude mice (<i>P</i> < 0.01). No obvious necrosis was observed in the tumor tissue in the negative control group (no drug intervention or lentivirus transfection) and vector group (the blank vector for lentivirus transfection), and more cells were loose and necrotic in the miR-328-3p group. Bioinformatics tools predicted that miR-328-3p has a targeting relationship with STAT3, and STAT3 was closely related to autophagy markers such as p62. After overexpressing miR-328-3p, the expression level of <i>STAT3</i> mRNA was significantly decreased (<i>P</i> < 0.01) and p-STAT3 was downregulated (<i>P</i> < 0.05). The dual-luciferase reporter gene assay showed that the luciferase activity of <i>miR-328-3p</i> and <i>STAT3</i> 3' untranslated regions of the wild-type reporter vector group was significantly decreased (<i>P</i> < 0.001). Overexpressed miR-328-3p combined with bafilomycin A<sub>1</sub> (Baf A<sub>1</sub>) was used to detect the expression of LC3 II. Compared with the vector group, the expression level of LC3 II in the overexpressed miR-328-3p group was downregulated (<i>P</i> < 0.05), and compared with the Baf A<sub>1</sub> group, the expression level of LC3 II in the overexpressed miR-328-3p + Baf A<sub>1</sub> group was upregulated (<i>P</i> < 0.01). The expression of LC3 II was detected after intervention of 18β-GRA in GC cells, and the results were consistent with the results of miR-328-3p overexpression (<i>P</i> < 0.05). Additional studies showed that 18β-GRA promoted autophagy flow by promoting autophagosome synthesis (<i>P</i> < 0.001). qPCR showed that the expression of <i>STAT3</i> mRNA was downregulated after drug intervention (<i>P</i> < 0.05). Western blot analysis showed that the expression levels of STAT3 and p-STAT3 were significantly downregulated after drug intervention (<i>P</i> < 0.05). 18β-GRA promotes the synthesis of autophagosomes and inhibits GC cell proliferation by regulating the miR-328-3p/STAT3 signaling pathway.",

Hyperglycemia exacerbates the pathogenesis of stroke, leading to more extensive cerebral damage and, as a result, to more severe consequences. However, the mechanism whereby the hyperglycemic status in diabetes affects biochemical processes during the development of ischemic injury is still not fully understood. In the present work, we record for the first time the real-time dynamics of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in the matrix of neuronal mitochondria in vitro in culture and in vivo in the brain tissues of rats during development of ischemic stroke under conditions of hyperglycemia and normal glucose levels. To accomplish this, we used a highly sensitive HyPer7 biosensor and a fiber-optic interface technology. We demonstrated that a high glycemic status does not affect the generation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in the tissues of the ischemic core, while significantly exacerbating the consequences of pathogenesis. For the first time using Raman microspectroscopy approach, we have shown how a sharp increase in the blood glucose level increases the relative amount of reduced cytochromes in the mitochondrial electron transport chain in neurons under normal conditions in awake mice.",

However, these techniques are unable to test how patterns of activity across a population contribute to computation because of an inability to both read and write cell-specific firing rates. To overcome this challenge, we make two advances: first, we introduce a genetic line of mice for Cre-dependent co-expression of a calcium indicator and a potent soma-targeted microbial opsin. Second, using this line, we develop a method for read-out and write-in of precise population vectors of neural activity by calibrating the photostimulation to each cell.

Long-term live imaging and lineage reconstructions reveal that blastomeres subject to higher fluid flow forces adopt ICM cell fates. These are reinforced by internal ferrofluid-induced flow force assays. We also utilize ex vivo fluid flow force mimicking and pharmacological perturbations to confirm mechanosensing specificity.

Data on patient and tumor characteristics were collected, along with laboratory measurements. Logistic regression was used to identify the predictors of the need for nasogastric feeding. Laboratory parameters were compared between patients who required nasogastric feeding vs those who did not.Nasogastric feeding was required in 90 patients (59%). Significant predictors of nasogastric feeding in HNC patients after surgery, which were revealed by univariate regression analysis, included low body mass index (odds ratio [OR] = 0.84), squamous cell carcinoma histology (OR = 8.05), T2 tumor stage (OR = 2.27), red blood cell count (M/µL) (OR = 0.44), hemoglobin levels (g/dL) (OR = 0.80), and mean corpuscular volume (fL) (OR = 1.10). Multivariate analysis showed that low BMI (OR = 0.87) and red blood cell count (M/µL) (OR = 0.32) were prognostic factors for nasogastric feeding. A significant percentage increase in white blood cell count from admission to discharge was noted in patients who required nasogastric feeding vs those who did not (<i>p</i> = 0.003).Determining factors that predict the need for nasogastric feeding in HNC patients after surgery may support more personalized treatment planning to optimize clinical outcomes.",

        "abstract": "The mechanisms underlying pulmonary hypertension (PH) remain largely unknown; further, why advanced vascular remodeling preferentially occurs in arterioles is yet to be answered. VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) regulates angiogenesis through Flk1 (fetal liver kinase 1) and Flt1 (fms-like tyrosine kinase 1) on endothelial cells (ECs), which may be related to PH pathogenesis. However, spatiotemporal expression patterns of Flk1 and Flt1 in the pulmonary vascular system and the role of endothelial Flk1 in PH development remain poorly understood. We analyzed multiple reporter mice, including Flk1-GFP (green fluorescent protein) bacterial artificial chromosome transgenic (Tg), Flt1-DsRed bacterial artificial chromosome Tg, and Flk1-GFP/Flt1-DsRed double Tg mice, to determine the spatiotemporal expression of Flk1 and Flt1 in hypoxia-induced PH. We also used Cdh5<sup>CreERT2</sup>/Flk1<sup>f/f</sup>/Tomato (Flk1-KO [knockout]) mice to induce EC-specific Flk1 deletion and lineage tracing in chronic hypoxia. Flk1 was specifically expressed in the ECs of small pulmonary vessels, including arterioles. Conversely, Flt1 was more broadly expressed in the ECs of large- to small-sized vessels in adult mouse lungs. Intriguingly, Flk1<sup>+</sup> ECs were transiently increased in hypoxia with proliferation, whereas Flt1 expression was unchanged. Flk1-KO mice did not exhibit pulmonary vascular remodeling nor PH in normoxia; however, the arteriolar ECs changed to a cuboidal shape with protrusion. In hypoxia, Flk1 deletion exacerbated EC dysfunction and reduced their number via apoptosis. Additionally, Flk1 deletion promoted medial thickening and neointimal formation in arterioles and worsened PH. Mechanistically, lineage tracing revealed that neointimal cells were derived from Flk1-KO ECs. Moreover, RNA sequencing in pulmonary ECs demonstrated that Flk1 deletion and hypoxia synergistically activated multiple pathways, including cell cycle, senescence/apoptosis, and cytokine/growth factor, concomitant with suppression of cell adhesion and angiogenesis, to promote vascular remodeling. Flk1 and Flt1 were differentially expressed in pulmonary ECs. Flk1 deficiency and hypoxia jointly dysregulated arteriolar ECs to promote vascular remodeling. Thus, dysfunction of Flk1<sup>+</sup> ECs may contribute to the pathogenesis of advanced vascular remodeling in pulmonary arterioles.",

Image-based communication (IBC) using comic-like strips is better than the conventional verbal and written modes, as it is inexpensive, less human resource dependent, and diversity agnostic. Strips based on local and socioculturally relevant issues and characters grab readers' attention, are relatable and entertaining, and utilize a storyline that invigorates thinking. The medical advice delivered by an ideal IBC strip is easy to comprehend, has a better recall, and promotes patient adherence. With an idea that IBC strips can serve as a vital supportive tool in underserved and overburdened clinics, we have described the nuances of adapting them into the existing physician-patient experience. We utilize a prototype IBC of an elderly woman helping a family whose child developed acute fever, possibly malaria. Various elements of an IBC strip, namely, panels, gutters, background, characters, bubbles, captions, and visual effects, are illustrated, and their variations are described later. Once designed, an IBC strip must be critically evaluated for the accuracy of the educational message, and errors, if any, must be corrected. The images are then subjected to a series of local field tests to ensure that they serve their purpose and have the desired cultural competence. Once ready, IBC strips can be posted in public spaces and outside clinics or distributed to healthcare workers or patients. Here, they serve as educational and health literacy tools. The strips can significantly reduce caregiver-patient interaction time and improve the quality of communication, especially when patients are illiterate or understand a different language. It is easier to develop rapport and partnership with a patient when the communication is presented through a pictorial tool. An IBC strip can be used to train grassroot workers, who subsequently train patients, thereby serving a dual purpose. To obtain tangible clinical and epidemiologic benefits from IBC strips, rigorous evidence building and standardization are a crucial long-term goal.",

Passive sampling and grab sampling were carried out simultaneously in the regions with vulnerable groundwater resources in Slovakia, between 2013 and 2021. For 27 pesticides and degradation products detected both in POCIS and the grab samples, in situ sampling rates were calculated and statistically evaluated. The limited effectiveness of the receiving phase in POCIS for sampling polar or ionized compounds was confirmed through a comparison of the medians of compound-specific sampling rates. For the majority of the monitored compounds the median sampling rates varied between 0.01 and 0.035 L/day. In some cases, the actual in situ values could be confirmed by parallel exposure of POCIS and silicone rubber sheet employed to obtain a benchmark for maximum attainable sampling rate. Sampling site and sampling period appear to have also some influence on the sampling rates, which was attributed in part to the groundwater velocity varying in both space and time. The influence of physico-chemical parameters (temperature, pH, electrolytic conductivity) remains mostly questionable due to the naturally limited ranges of recorded values over the entire duration of the study. Concentrations of pollutants in POCIS could be used for predicting time weighed average concentrations in water, provided the sampling rates were known and relatively constant. Generally, the compound-specific sampling rate cannot be considered constant due to a combination of naturally varying environmental factors that influence the actual in situ sampling rate. The relative standard deviation of concentration data from POCIS exposed in triplicates varied between approx. 5 %-50 %. Utilizing exploratory data analysis approach and tools enabled us to obtain a relatively complex picture of the situation and progress regarding pesticide pollution of groundwater in the monitored areas.",

Ethanol-induced plasticity and neuroadaptations predominantly occur in striatal direct pathway projecting medium spiny neurons (dMSNs). It is hypothesized that alterations in eCB neuromodulation may be involved. Recent work has implicated a role of eCB 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) in the rewarding effects of ethanol. However, there is insufficient research to answer which cellular subtype is responsible for mediating the 2-AG eCB signal that might be involved in the rewarding properties of ethanol and the mechanisms by which that occurs. To examine the role of dMSN mediated 2-AG signaling in ethanol related synaptic transmission and behaviors, we used conditional knockout mice in which the 2-AG-synthesizing enzyme diacylglycerol lipase α (DGLα) was deleted in dMSNs, DGLα<sup>D1-Cre+</sup>. Using acute brain slice photometry and a genetically encoded fluorescent eCB sensor, GRAB<sub>eCB2.0,</sub> to assess real-time eCB mediated activity of sensorimotor inputs from primary motor cortices (M1/M2) to the dorsolateral striatum, we showed that DGLα<sup>D1-Cre+</sup> mice had blunted evoked eCB-mediated presynaptic eCB signaling compared to littermate controls. Furthermore, ethanol induced eCB inhibition was significantly reduced in DGLα<sup>D1-Cre+</sup> deficient mice. Additionally, there was a reduction in the duration of loss of righting reflex (LORR) to a high dose of ethanol in the DGLα<sup>D1-Cre+</sup> mice compared to controls. These mice also showed a male-specific decrease in ethanol preference accompanied by an increase in ethanol-induced water consumption in a voluntary drinking paradigm. There were no significant differences observed in sucrose and quinine consumption between the genotypes. These findings reveal a novel role for dMSN mediated 2-AG signaling in modulating ethanol effects on presynaptic function and behavior.",

Many electrical synapses exhibit substantial plasticity that modulates the degree of coupling within groups of neurons, alters the fidelity of signal transmission, or even reconfigures functional circuits. In several known examples, such plasticity depends on calcium and is associated with neuronal activity. Calcium-driven signaling is known to promote potentiation of electrical synapses in fish Mauthner cells, mammalian retinal AII amacrine cells, and inferior olive neurons, and to promote depression in thalamic reticular neurons. To measure local calcium dynamics <i>in situ</i>, we developed a transgenic mouse expressing a GCaMP calcium biosensor fused to Connexin 36 (Cx36) at electrical synapses. We examined the sources of calcium for activity-dependent plasticity in retina slices using confocal or Super-Resolution Radial Fluctuations imaging. More than half of Cx36-GCaMP gap junctions responded to puffs of glutamate with transient increases in fluorescence. The responses were strongly dependent on NMDA receptors, in keeping with known activity-dependent signaling in some amacrine cells. We also found that some responses depended on the activity of voltage-gated calcium channels, representing a previously unrecognized source of calcium to control retinal electrical synaptic plasticity. The high prevalence of calcium signals at electrical synapses in response to glutamate application indicates that a large fraction of electrical synapses has the potential to be regulated by neuronal activity. This provides a means to tune circuit connectivity dynamically based on local activity.",

To date, considerably fewer studies have been published about the molecular and structural properties of mechanosensitive channels. Piezo channels are the only ion channel family in eukaryotes which is selectively gated by the membrane tension. Piezo channels have been described in mammals and some other eukaryotes. However, not much information is available for the crustaceans. Conventional cloning methods were used to clone the putative PIEZO channel mRNA in crayfish ganglia samples. HEK293T cells were transfected by the plasmid of the cloned gene for functional studies. The CDS of the mRNA translated into the protein sequence and three-dimensional structure of the channel has been calculated. An mRNA, 9378 bp, was firstly cloned from crayfish which codes a 2674 residues protein. The cloned sequence is similar to the piezo channel mRNAs reported in the other species. The sequence of the coded protein has been analyzed, and some functional domains have been identified. A three-dimensional structure of the coded protein was successfully calculated in reference to mouse piezo 1 channel protein data. A plasmid with a fluorescent protein indicator was synthesized for heterologous expression in HEK293T cells. The evoked calcium response to mechanical stimulation was not different from those observed in the control cells. However, the transfected cells were more sensitive to the gating modifier YODA-1. Based on the apparent similarity in sequence, structure and functional properties to other known piezo channels, it has been proposed that cloned mRNA may code a piezo-like ion channel in crayfish.",

        "abstract": "The genus <i>Flavivirus</i> is a group of arthropod-borne single-stranded RNA viruses, which includes important human and animal pathogens such as Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), Zika virus (ZIKV), Dengue virus (DENV), yellow fever virus (YFV), West Nile virus (WNV), and Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV). Reverse genetics has been a useful tool for understanding biological properties and the pathogenesis of flaviviruses. However, the conventional construction of full-length infectious clones for flavivirus is time-consuming and difficult due to the toxicity of the flavivirus genome to <i>E. coli</i>. Herein, we applied a simple, rapid, and bacterium-free circular polymerase extension reaction (CPER) method to synthesize recombinant flaviviruses in vertebrate cells as well as insect cells. We started with the de novo synthesis of the JEV vaccine strain SA-14-14-2 in Vero cells using CPER, and then modified the CPER method to recover insect-specific flaviviruses (ISFs) in mosquito C6/36 cells. Chimeric Zika virus (ChinZIKV) based on the Chaoyang virus (CYV) backbone and the Culex flavivirus reporter virus expressing green fluorescent protein (CxFV-GFP) were subsequently rescued in C6/36 cells. CPER is a simple method for the rapid generation of flaviviruses and other potential RNA viruses. A CPER-based recovery system for flaviviruses of different host ranges was established, which would facilitate the development of countermeasures against flavivirus outbreaks in the future.",

To overcome this, we developed an animal model using the intranasal administration of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus.

We used the model to evaluate the protective efficacy of monoclonal antibodies and the tissue tropism of different variants.

Through compensating for the missing peptide blocks in the alignment, 10 sibling sequences were artificially fabricated and named from ALuc55 to ALuc68. The phylogenetic analysis showed that the new ALucs formed an independent branch that was genetically isolated from other natural marine luciferases. The new ALucs successfully survived and luminesced with native coelenterazine (nCTZ) and its analogs in living mammalian cells. The results showed that the bioluminescence (BL) intensities of the ALucs were interestingly proportional to the length of the appended peptide blocks. The computational modeling revealed that the appended peptide blocks created a flexible region near the active site, potentially modulating the enzymatic activities. The new ALucs generated various colors with maximally approximately 90 nm redshifted BL spectra in orange upon reaction with the authors' previously reported <b>1</b>- and <b>2</b>-series coelenterazine analogs. The utilities of the new ALucs in bioassays were demonstrated through the construction of single-chain molecular strain probes and protein fragment complementation assay (PCA) probes.

However, traditional manual measurement methods have been found to be inefficient and harmful to fish. To overcome these shortcomings, this paper proposes a non-contact measurement method that utilizes binocular stereo vision to accurately measure the body length of fish underwater. Binocular cameras capture RGB and depth images to acquire the RGB-D data of the fish, and then the RGB images are selectively segmented using the contrast-adaptive Grab Cut algorithm. To determine the state of the fish, a skeleton extraction algorithm is employed to handle fish with curved bodies. The errors caused by the refraction of water are then analyzed and corrected. Finally, the best measurement points from the RGB image are extracted and converted into 3D spatial coordinates to calculate the length of the fish, for which measurement software was developed. The experimental results indicate that the mean relative percentage error for fish-length measurement is 0.9%.

Bioluminescence imaging is an advantageous method for in vivo studies that allows for the simple acquisition of images with low background signals. Researchers have increasingly been looking for ways to improve bioluminescent imaging for in vivo applications, which we sought to achieve by developing a bioluminescent probe that could specifically target cells of interest. We chose pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) as the disease model because it is the most common type of pancreatic cancer and has an extremely low survival rate. We targeted the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which is frequently overexpressed in pancreatic cancer cells, using an EGFR-specific affibody to selectively identify PDAC cells and delivered a <i>Gaussia</i> luciferase (GLuc) bioluminescent protein for imaging by engineering a fusion protein with both the affibody and the bioluminescent protein. This fusion protein was then complexed with a G5-PAMAM dendrimer nanocarrier. The dendrimer was used to improve the protein stability in vivo and increase signal strength. Our targeted bioluminescent complex had an enhanced uptake into PDAC cells in vitro and localized to PDAC tumors in vivo in pancreatic cancer xenograft mice. The bioluminescent complexes could delineate the tumor shape, identify multiple masses, and locate metastases. Through this work, an EGFR-targeted bioluminescent-dendrimer complex enabled the straightforward identification and imaging of pancreatic cancer cells in vivo in preclinical models. This argues for the targeted nanocarrier-mediated delivery of bioluminescent proteins as a way to improve in vivo bioluminescent imaging.",

The neural circuit mechanism underlying the between-individual variation in the pup-directed responsiveness of male mammals remains unclear. Monogamous mandarin voles were used to complete the present study. The male individuals were identified as paternal and infanticidal voles, according their behavioral responses to pups. It was found that the serotonin release in the medial preoptic area (MPOA), as well as the serotonergic neuron activity, significantly increased upon licking the pups, but showed no changes after attacking the pups, as revealed by the in vivo fiber photometry of the fluorescence signal from the 5-HT 1.0 sensor and the calcium imaging indicator, respectively. It was verified that the 5-HTergic neural projections to the MPOA originated mainly from the ventral part of the dorsal raphe (vDR). Furthermore, the chemogenetic inhibition of serotonergic projections from the vDR to the MPOA decreased the paternal behaviors and shortened the latency to attack the pups. In contrast, the activation of serotonergic neurons via optogenetics extended the licking duration and inhibited infanticide. Collectively, these results elucidate that the serotonergic projections from the vDR to the MPOA, a previously unrecognized pathway, regulate the paternal responses of virgin male mandarin voles to pups.",

We next created a 4-gene cassette driven by the <i>Ara2</i> promoter to allow for exogenous synthesis of casbene and transformed this multigene construct along with a selectable marker gene into <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>. Metabolic analysis on the transgenic lines revealed that continuous heat outperforms heat shock, with up to 1 μg/mg DW of casbene detected after 32 h of uninterrupted 40 °C heat.

It proliferates rapidly and can metastasize into farther tissues at any stage due to the gradual invasiveness and motility of the tumor cells. These crucial properties are the outcome of the weakened intercellular adhesion, regulated by small guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases), which hydrolyze to the guanosine diphosphate (GDP)-bound conformation. We investigated the inactivating effect of <i>ARHGAP1</i> on Rho GTPases involved signaling pathways after treatment with a high dose of doxorubicin. Label-free quantitative proteomic analysis of the proteome isolated from the MCF-7 breast cancer cell line, treated with 1 μM of doxorubicin, identified <i>RAC1</i>, <i>CDC42</i>, and <i>RHOA</i> GTPases that were inactivated by the <i>ARHGAP1</i> protein. Upregulation of the GTPases involved in the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) signaling pathway initiated epithelial-mesenchymal transitions. These findings demonstrate a key role of the <i>ARHGAP1</i> protein in the disruption of the cell adhesion and simultaneously allow for a better understanding of the molecular mechanism of the reduced cell adhesion leading to the subsequent metastasis. The conclusions of this study corroborate the hypothesis that chemotherapy with doxorubicin may increase the risk of metastases in drug-resistant breast cancer cells.",

The diversity of vector systems and cell carriers for the delivery of therapeutic genes revealed the difficulty of developing and implementing a safe and effective drug containing artificial genetic material for the treatment of human diseases in practical medicine. Therefore, in this study we assessed changes in the transcriptome and secretome of umbilical cord blood mononuclear cells (UCB-MCs) genetically modified using adenoviral vector (Ad5) carrying cDNA encoding human vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF165) or reporter green fluorescent protein (GFP). A preliminary analysis of UCB-MCs transduced with Ad5-VEGF165 and Ad5-GFP with MOI of 10 showed efficient transgene expression in gene-modified UCB-MCs at mRNA and protein levels. The whole transcriptome sequencing of native UCB-MCs, UCB-MC+Ad5-VEGF165, and UCB-MC+Ad5-GFP demonstrated individual sample variability rather than the effect of Ad5 or the expression of recombinant <i>vegf165</i> on UCB-MC transcriptomes. A multiplex secretome analysis indicated that neither the transduction of UCB-MCs with Ad5-GFP nor with Ad5-VEGF165 affects the secretion of the studied cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors by gene-modified cells. Here, we show that UCB-MCs transduced with Ad5 carrying cDNA encoding human VEGF165 efficiently express transgenes and preserve transcriptome and secretome patterns.

By tuning the number of hydroxyl groups, we optimize the selectivity of fluorescent protein chromophores toward aggregated proteins in these biological samples. In recombinant protein applications, the most hydrophobic P0 (cLogP = 5.28) offers the highest fold change (FC = 31.6), sensitivity (LLOD = 0.1 μM), and brightness (Φ = 0.20) upon binding to aggregated proteins. In contrast, P4 of balanced amphiphilicity (cLogP = 2.32) is required for selective detection of proteome stresses in live cells. In mouse and human liver histology tissues, hydrophobic P1 exhibits the best performance in staining the aggregated proteome. Overall, the amphiphilicity of fluorescent chromophores governs the sensor's performance by matching the diverse nature of different biological samples.

The SCN receives photic information exclusively through melanopsin-expressing retinal ganglion cells (mRGCs) to synchronize circadian rhythms with the environmental light cycles. The SCN is composed of two major peptidergic neuron types in the core and shell regions of the SCN. Determining how mRGCs interact with the network of synaptic connections onto and between SCN neurons is key to understand how light regulates the circadian clock and to elucidate the relevant local circuits within the SCN. To map these connections, we used a newly developed Cre-dependent electron microscopy (EM) reporter, APEX2, to label the mitochondria of mRGC axons. Serial blockface scanning electron microscopy was then used to resolve the fine 3D structure of mRGC axons and synaptic boutons in the SCN of a male mouse. The resulting maps reveal patterns of connectomic organization in the core and shell of the SCN. We show that these regions are composed of different neuronal subtypes and differ with regard to the pattern of mRGC input, as the shell receives denser mRGC synaptic input compared with the core. This finding challenges the present view that photic information coming directly from the retina is received primarily by the core region of the SCN.",

The central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) is known not only for its role in the regulation of anxiety but also as an important site for the negative affective dimension of pain. Pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide (PACAP), a neuropeptide whose terminals are abundant in the CeA, is strongly implicated in the stress response as well as in pain processing. Here, using Cre-dependent viral vectors, we explored in greater detail the role of the PACAP projection to the CeA that originates in the lateral parabrachial nucleus (LPB). We first performed a circuit mapping experiment by injecting an anterograde Cre-dependent virus expressing a fluorescent reporter in the LPB of PACAP-Cre mice and observing their projections. Then, we used a chemogenetic approach (a Cre-dependent Designer Receptors Activated by Designer Drugs, DREADDs) to assess the effects of the direct stimulation of the PACAP LPB to CeA projection on general locomotor activity, anxiety-like behavior (using a defensive withdrawal test), and mechanical pain sensitivity (using the von Frey test). We found that the CeA, together with other areas, is one of the major downstream projection targets of PACAP neurons originating in the lateral parabrachial nucleus (LPB). In the DREADD experiment, we then found that the selective activation of this neuronal pathway is sufficient to increase both anxiety-like behavior and mechanical pain sensitivity in mice, without affecting general locomotor activity. In conclusion, our data suggest that the dysregulation of this circuit may contribute to a variety of anxiety disorders and chronic pain states, and that PACAP may represent an important therapeutic target for the treatment of these conditions.",

An in vitro model consisting of a fixed 24-mm polyethylene terephthalate (Dacron; DuPont) graft sutured proximally and distally to two specifically designed 40-mm rings, with four force sensing resistors attached at four equally distant positions and a USB camera attached proximally for photographic and video documentation was used for deployment of Zenith TX2 (Cook Medical Inc) dissection platform endografts with diameters between 24 and 36 mm. After deployment, ballooning with a 32-mm compliant balloon was performed to simulate real-life conditions. The assessment of oversizing included visual inspection, calculation of the valley areas created between the prosthetic wall and the stent graft fabric, distance between the stent graft peaks, the radial force exerted by the proximal sealing stent, and the pull-out force necessary for endograft extraction. A total of 70 endografts were deployed with the oversizing ranging from 0% to 50%: 10 × 24 mm, 10 × 26 mm, 10 × 28 mm, 10 × 30 mm, 10 × 32 mm, 10 × 34 mm, and 10 × 36 mm.

The mean radial force of the proximal sealing stent was greater after remodeling with a compliant balloon (0.55 ± 0.02 N vs 0.60 ± 0.02 N after ballooning; <i>P</i> < .001). However, greater oversizing did not lead to an increase in the radial force exerted by the proximal sealing stent. The findings from the present study offer additional insight into the mechanics of oversized stent grafts in surgical grafts. In endografts with the Zenith stent design (TX2), oversizing of <16.7% resulted in reduced resistance to displacement forces, and oversizing of >50% was associated with major infolding in 20% of cases. Long-term in vitro and in vivo testing is required to understand how these mechanical properties affect the clinical outcomes of oversizing.",

Owing to their highly reactive nature and extremely short lifetime in the body, these molecules are difficult to detect. Here we develop a miniaturized device that integrates genetically engineered probiotic biosensors with a custom-designed photodetector and readout chip to track these molecules in the gastrointestinal tract. Leveraging the molecular specificity of living sensors<sup>1</sup>, we genetically encoded bacteria to respond to inflammation-associated molecules by producing luminescence. Low-power electronic readout circuits<sup>2</sup> integrated into the device convert the light emitted by the encapsulated bacteria to a wireless signal. We demonstrate in vivo biosensor monitoring in the gastrointestinal tract of small and large animal models and the integration of all components into a sub-1.4 cm<sup>3</sup> form factor that is compatible with ingestion and capable of supporting wireless communication. With this device, diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease could be diagnosed earlier than is currently possible, and disease progression could be more accurately tracked. The wireless detection of short-lived, disease-associated molecules with our device could also support timely communication between patients and caregivers, as well as remote personalized care.",

Although 4-MBC residues have been extensively identified in aquatic waters, little is known about their occurrence, levels, and potential risk in coastal waters. This study developed a reliable sampling approach, based on diffusive gradients in thin films (DGT) with XAD-2 as the binding agent, for monitoring 4-MBC in coastal waters. The diffusion coefficients of 4-MBC in freshwater and artificial seawater were 3.65 × 10<sup>-6</sup> cm<sup>2</sup>/s and 3.83 × 10<sup>-6</sup> cm<sup>2</sup>/s, respectively. XAD-2 binding gel showed rapid adsorption to 4-MBC. The accumulated masses of 4-MBC in XAD-2 DGT increased linearly with deployed time for 7 days in freshwater and seawater, which agreed well with theoretical predictions. The sampling performance was independent of ionic strength (0.0001-0.5 M), pH (4.0-8.5), and dissolved organic matter (0-20 mg/L). Field deployment in the river estuary and bathing beach showed that DGT-measured 4-MBC concentrations were consistent in comparison with grab sampling. Environmental risk assessment showed that 4-MBC may pose a medium risk to aquatic organisms based on computed risk quotient (RQ) values. Sewage discharge is the main source of 4-MBC risk, while the residue in recreation beaches contributes more significantly in summer. The established DGT sampling is suitable for seasonal monitoring, source identification, and risk assessment of 4-MBC in coastal waters.",

        "abstract": "<b><i>Purpose:</i></b> Penetrating eye injuries commonly cause permanent loss of vision in patients. Unlike mammals, zebrafish can regenerate both damaged tissue and severed axons in the central nervous system. Here, we present a tractable adult zebrafish model to study intraocular axon regeneration after penetrating eye injury. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> To create consistent penetrating intraocular injuries, pins of standardized diameters were inserted into the eye through the cornea and penetrating the retina but not the underlying sclera. Transgenic g<i>ap43:GFP</i> reporter fish were used to preferentially label retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) that respond to injury with regenerating axons. Retinas were fixed and flat mounted at various times postinjury to examine injury size, number of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-positive cells and axons, axonal varicosities, and rate of regeneration to the optic nerve head. Intraocular injection of colchicine was used to inhibit axon outgrow as a proof of principle that this method can be used to screen effects of pharmacological agents on intraocular axon regeneration. <b><i>Results:</i></b> Penetrating injury to the zebrafish retina results in robust axon regeneration by RGCs around and beyond the site of injury. The <i>gap43:GFP</i> transgene allows visualization of individual or small bundles of axons with varicosities and growth cones easily observable. Regeneration proceeded with most, if not all, axons reaching the optic nerve head by 3-day postinjury. A single intraocular injection of colchicine a day after injury was sufficient to delay axon regeneration at 2-days postinjury. Surprisingly, we identified a stereotypically located population of circumferential projecting neurons within the retina that upregulate <i>gap43:GFP</i> expression after injury. <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> Penetrating injury to the adult <i>gap43:GFP</i> transgenic zebrafish eye is a model of successful intraocular axon regeneration. The pharmacological and genetic tools available for this organism should make it a powerful tool for dissecting the cellular, molecular, and genetic mechanisms of axon regeneration in the intraocular environment.",

        "abstract": "At present lentiviral vector production for cell and gene therapy commonly involves transient plasmid transfection of mammalian cells cultivated in serum-containing media and addition of exogenous nuclease to reduce host cell and plasmid DNA impurities. Switching from serum-containing media to chemically-defined, serum free media, and minimising the number of process additions, are both increasingly regarded as necessary steps for simplifying and potentially automating lentiviral vector bioprocessing in future. Here we adapted human embryonic kidney 293T (HEK293T) cells to grow in serum-free media and also modified these cells with transgenes designed to encode a secreted nuclease activity. Stable transfection of HEK293T cells with transgenes encoding the <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> nuclease B (NucB) open reading frame with either its native secretion signal peptide, the murine Igκ chain leader sequence or a novel viral transport fusion protein, all resulted in qualitatively detectable nuclease activity in serum-free media. Serum-free transient transfection of human embryonic kidney HEK293T cells stably harbouring the transgene for NucB with its native secretion signal produced active lentivirus in the presence of medium-resident nuclease activity. This lentivirus material was able to transduce the AGF-T immortal T cell line with a green fluorescent protein reporter payload at a level of 2.05 × 10<sup>5</sup> TU/mL (±3.34 × 10<sup>4</sup> TU/mL). Sufficient nuclease activity was present in 10 μL of this unconcentrated lentivirus material to degrade 1.5 μg DNA within 2 h at 37 °C, without agitation - conditions compatible with lentivirus production. These observations demonstrate that lentiviral vector production, by transient transfection, is compatible with host cells harbouring a nuclease transgene and evidencing nuclease activity in their surrounding growth media. This work provides a solid basis for future investigations, beyond the scope of this present study, in which commercial and academic groups can apply this approach to therapeutic payloads and potentially omit exogenous nuclease bioprocess additions.",

In this study, we investigated the activity of intratumoral hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF), which functions as a master regulator of the cellular response to hypoxia and inflammation. We constructed the HIF activity-monitoring reporter gene hypoxia-response element-Venus-Akaluc (HVA) that expresses the green fluorescent protein Venus and modified firefly luciferase Akaluc in a HIF activity-dependent manner, and created transgenic mice harboring HVA transgene (HVA-Tg). In HVA-Tg, HIF-active cells can be visualized using AkaBLI, an ultra-sensitive in vivo bioluminescence imaging technology that produces an intense near-infrared light upon reaction of Akaluc with the D-luciferin analog AkaLumine-HCl. By orthotopic transplantation of E0771, a mouse triple negative breast cancer cell line without a reporter gene, into HVA-Tg, we succeeded in noninvasively monitoring bioluminescence signals from HIF-active stromal cells as early as 8 days after transplantation. The HIF-active stromal cells initially clustered locally and then spread throughout the tumors with growth. Immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry analyses revealed that CD11b<sup>+</sup> F4/80<sup>+</sup> macrophages were the predominant HIF-active stromal cells in E0771 tumors. These results indicate that HVA-Tg is a useful tool for spatiotemporal analysis of HIF-active tumor stromal cells, facilitating investigation of the roles of HIF-active tumor stromal cells in tumor growth and malignant progression.",

Particularly, the pathogenesis of a few diseases including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is closely related to high ATP concentrations. A bioluminescent D-luciferin/luciferase system, which includes a luciferase (FLuc) from the firefly <i>Photinus pyralis</i> as a key component, is the most commonly used method for the detection and quantification of ATP. Here, instead of isolating FLuc produced in recombinant <i>Escherichia coli</i>, we aimed to develop a whole-cell biocatalyst system that does not require extraction and purification of FLuc. To this end, the gene coding for FLuc was introduced into the genome of probiotic <i>Saccharomyces boulardii</i> using the CRISPR/Cas9-based genome editing system. The linear relationship (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.9561) between ATP levels and bioluminescence generated from the engineered <i>S. boulardii</i> expressing FLuc was observed in vitro. To explore the feasibility of using the engineered <i>S. boulardii</i> expressing FLuc as a whole-cell biosensor to detect inflammation biomarker (<i>i.e.</i>, ATP) in the gut, a colitis mouse model was established using dextran sodium sulfate as a colitogenic compound. Our findings demonstrated that the whole-cell biosensor can detect elevated ATP levels during gut inflammation in mice.

All parents/guardians of children enrolled in a school district in Connecticut were invited to participate in an online survey in December 2021. The respondents included summer meal participants (n = 622) and nonparticipants (n = 294). Survey respondents reported demographic variables, current food sufficiency, communication preferences, satisfaction with the program, reasons for using or not using the program, and whether they found the program helpful financially. The survey included three open-ended questions about barriers to participation. Respondents who used the summer meal program indicated that the pandemic-related regulatory waivers were key to their decision to participate. Reported barriers included lack of awareness of the program, inability to travel to sites during the times they were open, lack of transportation, concerns about dietary restrictions, and lack of variety in the menu, and concerns about wasting food. Parents/guardians expressed strong preferences for receiving communication about summer meals directly from their child's school and being able to access meals outside of typical work hours. The pandemic waivers allowed sponsors to test different models of distribution. Parents/guardians responded positively to the opportunity to access grab-and-go meals, multiple meals at once, and meals without a child present.

However, the time course and the extent of these changes remain largely uncharacterized. To investigate dynamic changes in intracellular macromolecular crowding (MMC) induced by hyperosmotic stress in live cells, we used fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) to quantify changes in the local environment by measuring the fluorescence lifetime and the diffusion of the monomeric enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP), respectively. Real-time monitoring of eGFP fluorescence lifetime showed that a faster response to environmental changes due to MMC is observed than when measuring the acceptor/donor emission ratio using the MMC-sensitive Förster resonance energy transfer sensor (GimRET). This suggests that eGFP molecular electronic states and/or collision frequency are affected by changes in the immediate surroundings due to MMC without requiring conformational changes as is the case for the GimRET sensor. Furthermore, eGFP diffusion assessed by FCS indicated higher intracellular viscosity due to increased MMC during hyperosmotic stress. Our findings reveal that changes in eGFP fluorescence lifetime and diffusion are early indicators of elevated intracellular MMC. Our approach can therefore be used to reveal in live cells short-lived transient states through which MMC builds over time, which could not be observed when measuring changes in other physical properties that occur at slower time scales.",

For classical fluorescent protein systems (i.e., GFP and derivatives), chromophore maturation is O<sub>2</sub>-dependent, restricting their applications to aerobic organisms. In this work, we pioneered the use of the oxygen-independent system FAST (Fluorescence Activating and absorption Shifting tag) in the thermophilic anaerobe <i>Thermoanaerobacter kivui</i>. We developed a modular cloning system that was used to easily clone a library of FAST expression cassettes in an <i>E. coli</i>-<i>Thermoanaerobacter</i> shuttle plasmid. FAST-mediated fluorescence was then assessed <i>in vivo</i> in <i>T. kivui</i>, and we observed bright green and red fluorescence for cells grown at 55°C. Next, we took advantage of this functional reporter system to characterize a set of homologous and heterologous promoters by quantifying gene expression, expanding the <i>T. kivui</i> genetic toolbox. Low fluorescence at 66°C (T<sub>opt</sub> for <i>T. kivui</i>) was subsequently investigated at the single-cell level using flow cytometry and attributed to plasmid instability at higher temperatures. Adaptive laboratory evolution circumvented this issue and drastically enhanced fluorescence at 66°C. Whole plasmid sequencing revealed the evolved strain carried functional plasmids truncated at the Gram-positive origin of replication, that could however not be linked to the increased fluorescence displayed by the evolved strain. Collectively, our work demonstrates the applicability of the FAST fluorescent reporter systems to <i>T. kivui</i>, paving the way for further applications in thermophilic anaerobes.",

Here, we introduce a family of sensitive multicolor norepinephrine (NE) indicators, which includes nLightG (green) and nLightR (red). These tools report endogenous NE release in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo with improved sensitivity, ligand selectivity and kinetics, as well as a distinct pharmacological profile compared with previous state-of-the-art GRAB<sub>NE</sub> indicators. Using in vivo multisite fiber photometry recordings of nLightG, we could simultaneously monitor optogenetically evoked NE release in the mouse locus coeruleus and hippocampus. Two-photon imaging of nLightG revealed locomotion and reward-related NE transients in the dorsal CA1 area of the hippocampus. Thus, the sensitive NE indicators introduced here represent an important addition to the current repertoire of indicators and provide the means for a thorough investigation of the NE system.",

        "abstract": "Specification of the epiblast (EPI) and primitive endoderm (PE) in the mouse embryo involves fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling through the RAS/MAP kinase pathway. FGFR1 and FGFR2 are thought to mediate this signaling in the inner cell mass (ICM) of the mouse blastocyst and BMP signaling can also influence PE specification. In this study, we further explored the dynamics of FGFR2 expression through an enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) reporter mouse line (FGFR2-eGFP). We observed that FGFR2-eGFP is present in the late 8-cell stage; however, it is absent or reduced in the ICM of early blastocysts. We then statistically correlated eGFP expression with PE and EPI markers GATA6 and NANOG, respectively. We detected that eGFP is weakly correlated with GATA6 in early blastocysts, but this correlation quickly increases as the blastocyst develops. The correlation between eGFP and NANOG decreases throughout blastocyst development. Treatment with FGF from the morula stage onwards did not affect FGFR2-eGFP presence in the ICM of early blastocysts; however, late blastocysts presented FGFR2-eGFP in all cells of the ICM. BMP treatment positively influenced FGFR2-eGFP expression and reduced the number of NANOG-positive cells in late blastocysts. In conclusion, FGFR2 is not strongly associated with PE precursors in the early blastocyst, but it is highly correlated with PE cells as blastocyst development progresses, consistent with the proposed role for FGFR2 in maintenance rather than initiating the PE lineage.",

Two independent probes, one inserted in an extracellular site distal to the pore and the other in a distant intracellular proximal position, elicit sizable fluorescence signals when the tagged channels activate in response to fluid shear stress of low intensity. Neither cellular indentations nor osmotic swelling of the cell elicit detectable fluorescence signals from either probe, despite the ability of these stimuli to activate the tagged channels. High-intensity flow stimuli are ineffective at eliciting fluorescence signals from either probe.

Over the last several decades, many studies have been conducted to determine possible CEST agents, such as endogenously expressed compounds or proteins, that can be utilized to produce contrast with minimally invasive procedures and reduced or non-existent levels of toxicity. In recent years there has been an increased interest in the generation of genetically engineered CEST contrast agents, typically based on existing proteins with CEST contrast or modified to produce CEST contrast. We have developed an in silico method for the evolution of peptide sequences to optimize CEST contrast and showed that these peptides could be combined to create de novo biosensors for CEST MRI. A single protein, superCESTide, was designed to be 198 amino acids. SuperCESTide was expressed in E. coli and purified with size exclusion chromatography. The magnetic transfer ratio asymmetry generated by superCESTide was comparable to levels seen in previous CEST reporters, such as protamine sulfate (salmon protamine) and human protamine. These data show that novel peptides with sequences optimized in silico for CEST contrast that utilize a more comprehensive range of amino acids can still produce contrast when assembled into protein units expressed in complex living environments.",

This has been suggested to depend on activation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent pathways, but the mechanism underlying reverse transport via endogenously expressed DAT is still unclear. Here, to enable concurrent visualization by live imaging of extracellular DA dynamics and cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels, we employ the fluorescent Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor jRGECO1a expressed in cultured dopaminergic neurons together with the fluorescent DA sensor GRAB<sub>DA1H</sub> expressed in cocultured \"sniffer\" cells. In the presence of the Na<sup>+</sup>-channel blocker tetrodotoxin to prevent exocytotic DA release, AMPH induced in the cultured neurons a profound dose-dependent efflux of DA that was blocked both by inhibition of DAT with cocaine and by inhibition of the vesicular monoamine transporter-2 with Ro-4-1284 or reserpine. However, the AMPH-induced DA efflux was not accompanied by an increase in cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> and was unaffected by blockade of voltage-gated calcium channels or chelation of cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup>. The independence of cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> was further supported by activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate-type ionotropic glutamate receptors leading to a marked increase in cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> without affecting AMPH-induced DA efflux. Curiously, AMPH elicited spontaneous Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes upon blockade of the D2 receptor, suggesting that AMPH can regulate intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> in an autoreceptor-dependent manner regardless of the apparent independence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> for AMPH-induced efflux.

Sustained activation of this TRPC channel-based pathophysiological signaling hub in neurons and glia likely contributes to prodigious excitotoxicity-driven secondary brain injury expansion. This was investigated in mouse models with selective Trpc gene knockout (KO). In adult cerebellar brain slices, application of glutamate and the class I metabotropic glutamate receptor agonist (S)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine to Purkinje neurons expressing the GCaMP5g Ca<sup>2+</sup> reporter demonstrated that the majority of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> loading in the molecular layer dendritic arbors was attributable to the TRPC3 effector channels (Trpc3<sup>KO</sup> compared with wildtype (WT)).

An exogenous peptide, (DPc10) detects leaky RyR2 in cardiomyocytes. Conversely, calmodulin (CaM) inhibits RyR2 leak. These observations have led to designing a FRET biosensor for drug discovery targeting RyR2. Here we used FRET to understand the molecular mechanism driving the DPc10-CaM interdependence when binding RyR2 in SR vesicles. We used donor-FKBP12.6 (D-FKBP) to resolve RyR2 binding of acceptor-CaM (A-CaM). In low nanomolar Ca <sup>2+</sup> , DPc10 decreased both FRET <sub>max</sub> (under saturating [A-CaM]) and the CaM/RyR2 binding affinity. In micromolar Ca <sup>2+</sup> , DPc10 decreased FRET <sub>max</sub> without affecting CaM/RyR2 binding affinity. This correlates with analysis of fluorescence-lifetime-detected FRET indicating that DPc10 lowers occupancy of the RyR2 CaM-binding sites in nanomolar (not micromolar) Ca <sup>2+</sup> and lengthens D-FKBP/A-CaM distances independent of [Ca <sup>2+</sup> ]. To observe DPc10/RyR2 binding, we used acceptor-DPc10 (A-DPc10). CaM weakens A-DPc10/RyR2 binding, this effect being larger in micromolar vs. nanomolar Ca <sup>2+</sup> . Moreover, A-DPc10/RyR2 binding is cooperative in CaM- and FKBP-dependent manner, suggesting that both endogenous modulators promote concerted structural changes between RyR2 protomers for channel regulation. Aided by analysis of cryo-EM structures, these insights inform further development of the DPc10-CaM paradigm for therapeutic discovery targeting RyR2.",

For the first time, this bioreporter has been applied on the high-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC) adsorbent surface to develop a respective planar bioluminescence bioassay (pA-YBS). The goal was to combine the advantages of HPTLC with a more selective bioassay detection for bisphenols. The performance of this pA-YBS bioluminescence bioassay was demonstrated by calculating the half-maximal effective concentration (EC<sub>50</sub>) of bisphenols compared to references. The EC<sub>50</sub> ranged from 267 pg/band for bisphenol Z and 322 pg/band for bisphenol A (BPA) to > 1 ng/band for other bisphenols (BPC, BPE, BPF, and BPS) and references (17β-estradiol and 17α-ethinylestradiol). The EC<sub>50</sub> value of BPA was three times more sensitive in signal detection than that of 17β-estradiol. The visual or videodensitometric limit of detection of BPA was about 200 pg/zone. The higher signal intensity and sensitivity for BPA confirmed the tailored bioassay selectivity compared to the existing estrogen screen bioassay. It worked on different types of HPTLC silica gel plates. This HPTLC-UV/Vis/FLD-pA-YBS bioluminescence bioassay method was used to analyze complex mixtures such as six tin can migrates, five thermal papers, and eleven botanicals. The detected estrogenic compound zones in the tin can migrates were successfully verified via the duplex planar yeast antagonist estrogen screen (pYAES) bioassay. The two bisphenols A and S were identified in one out of five thermal papers and confirmed with high-resolution mass spectrometry. No bisphenols were detected in the botanicals investigated via the pA-YBS bioluminescence bioassay. However, the botanicals proved to contain phytoestrogens as detected via the pYAES bioassay, which confirmed the tailored bioassay selectivity.

Whether and how wild-type TDP-43 drives pathological changes in SMNs in vivo remains largely unexplored. In this study, we develop a two-photon calcium imaging setup in which tactile-evoked neural responses of motor neurons in the brainstem and spinal cord can be monitored using the calcium indicator GCaMP. We devise a piezo-assisted tactile stimulator that reproducibly evokes a brainstem descending neuron upon tactile stimulation of the head. A direct comparison between caudal primary motor neurons (CaPs) with or without TDP-43 overexpression in contiguous spinal segments demonstrates that CaPs overexpressing TDP-43 display attenuated Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients during fictive escape locomotion evoked by the tactile stimulation. These results show that excessive amounts of TDP-43 protein reduce the neuronal excitability of SMNs and potentially contribute to asymptomatic pathological lesions of SMNs and movement disorders in patients with ALS.",

Most genetically encoded optical sensors currently used are based on fluorescence and have been highly successful tools for single-cell imaging in superficial brain regions. However, there remains a need to develop new tools for reporting neuronal activity <i>in vivo</i> within deeper structures without the need for hardware such as lenses or fibers to be implanted within the brain. Our approach to this problem is to replace the fluorescent elements of the existing biosensors with bioluminescent elements. This eliminates the need of external light sources to illuminate the sensor, thus allowing deeper brain regions to be imaged noninvasively. Here, we report the development of the first genetically encoded neurotransmitter indicators based on bioluminescent light emission. These probes were optimized by high-throughput screening of linker libraries. The selected probes exhibit robust changes in light output in response to the extracellular presence of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate. We expect this new approach to neurotransmitter indicator design to enable the engineering of specific bioluminescent probes for multiple additional neurotransmitters in the future, ultimately allowing neuroscientists to monitor activity associated with a specific neurotransmitter as it relates to behavior in a variety of neuronal and psychiatric disorders, among many other applications.",

Firstly, the paper establishes and expends a multi-target grasping dataset, as well as introduces and uses transfer learning to conduct network pre-training on the single-target dataset and slightly modify the model parameters using the multi-target dataset. Secondly, the SqueezeNet model is optimized and improved using the attention mechanism and atrous spatial pyramid pooling module. The paper introduces the attention mechanism network to weight the transmitted feature map in the channel and spatial dimensions. It uses a variety of parallel operations of atrous convolution with different atrous rates to increase the size of the receptive field and preserve features from different ranges. Finally, the CBAM-ASPP-SqueezeNet algorithm is verified using the self-constructed, multi-target capture dataset. When the paper introduces transfer learning, the various indicators converge after training 20 epochs. In the physical grabbing experiment conducted by Kinova and SIASUN Arm, a network grabbing success rate of 93% was achieved.",

Gene therapy guided through the use of biomaterials may steadily activate the processes of repair in sites of ACL injury. The goal of the present study was to test the hypothesis that functionalized poly(sodium styrene sulfonate)-grafted poly(ε-caprolactone) (pNaSS-grafted PCL) films can effectively deliver recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) vectors as a means of overexpressing two reparative factors (transforming growth factor beta-TGF-β and basic fibroblast growth factor-FGF-2) in primary human ACL fibroblasts. Effective, durable rAAV reporter red fluorescent protein and candidate TGF-β and FGF-2 gene overexpression was achieved in the cells for at least 21 days, especially when pNaSS-grafted PCL films were used versus control conditions, such as ungrafted films and systems lacking vectors or films (between 1.8- and 5.2-fold differences), showing interactive regulation of growth factor production. The expression of TGF-β and FGF-2 from rAAV via PCL films safely enhanced extracellular matrix depositions of type-I/-III collagen, proteoglycans/decorin, and tenascin-C (between 1.4- and 4.5-fold differences) in the cells over time with increased levels of expression of the specific transcription factors Mohawk and scleraxis (between 1.7- and 3.7-fold differences) and without the activation of the inflammatory mediators IL-1β and TNF-α, most particularly with pNaSS-grafted PCL films relative to the controls. This work shows the value of combining rAAV gene therapy with functionalized PCL films to enhance ACL repair.",

Primary EBEC cultures established from healthy adult horses and commercially sourced human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs) were used as a positive control. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expression by EBECs was demonstrated using immunofluorescence, western immunoblot, and flow cytometry. EBECs were transduced with a lentivirus pseudotyped with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that binds to ACE2 and expresses the enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) as a reporter. Cells were transduced with the pseudovirus at a multiplicity of infection of 0.1 for 6 hours, washed, and maintained in media for 96 hours. After 96 hours, eGFP expression in EBECs was assessed by fluorescence microscopy of cell cultures and quantitative PCR. ACE2 expression in EBECs detected by immunofluorescence, western immunoblotting, and flow cytometry was lower in EBECs than in HBECs. After 96 hours, eGFP expression in EBECs was demonstrated by fluorescence microscopy, and mean ΔCt values from quantitative PCR were significantly (P < .0001) higher in EBECs (8.78) than HBECs (3.24) indicating lower infectivity in EBECs. Equine respiratory tract cells were susceptible to cell entry with a SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus. Lower replication efficiency in EBECs suggests that horses are unlikely to be an important zoonotic host of SARS-CoV-2, but viral mutations could render some strains more infective to horses. Serological and virological monitoring of horses in contact with persons shedding SARS-CoV-2 is warranted.",

Here, we report the first-of-its-kind integration and optimization of BLI in microfluidic chips, for non-invasive imaging of multiple biological readouts. The cell line HEK293T-GFP was engineered to express NanoLuc® luciferase under the control of a constitutive promoter and were cultured on-chip in 3D, in standard ECM-like hydrogels, to assess optimal cell detection conditions. Using real-time in-vitro dual-color microscopy, Bioluminescence (BL) and fluorescence (FL) were detectable using distinct imaging setups. Detection of the bioluminescent signals were observed at single cell resolution on-chip 20 min post-addition of Furimazine substrate and under perfusion. All hydrogels enabled BLI with higher signal-to-noise ratios as compared to fluorescence. For instance, agarose gels showed a ∼5-fold greater BL signal over background after injection of the substrate as compared to the FL signal. The use of BLI with microfluidic chip technologies opens up the potential for simultaneous in situ detection with continuous monitoring of multicolor cell reporters. Moreover, this can be achieved in a non-invasive manner. BL has great promise as a highly desirable biosensor for studying organ-on-chip platforms.",

Comparing responses from dye and protein-based indicators may provide information about indicator properties and cell physiology, but side-by-side recordings in cells are scarce. In this study, we compared cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>) changes in insulin-secreting β-cells recorded with commonly used dyes and indicators based on circularly permuted fluorescent proteins. Total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) imaging of K<sup>+</sup> depolarization-triggered submembrane [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> increases showed that the dyes Fluo-4 and Fluo-5F mainly reported stable [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> elevations, whereas the proteins R-GECO1 and GCaMP5G more often reported distinct [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> spikes from an elevated level. [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> spiking occurred also in glucose-stimulated cells. The spikes reflected Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from the endoplasmic reticulum, triggered by autocrine activation of purinergic receptors after exocytotic release of ATP and/or ADP, and the spikes were consequently prevented by SERCA inhibition or P2Y<sub>1</sub>-receptor antagonism. Widefield imaging, which monitors the entire cytoplasm, increased the spike detection by the Ca<sup>2+</sup> dyes. The indicator-dependent response patterns were unrelated to Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding affinity, buffering and mobility, and probably reflects the much slower dissociation kinetics of protein compared to dye indicators. Ca<sup>2+</sup> dyes thus report signalling within the submembrane space excited by TIRF illumination, whereas the protein indicators also catch Ca<sup>2+</sup> events originating outside this volume. The study highlights that voltage-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry in β-cells is tightly linked to local intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> release mediated via an autocrine route that may be more important than previously reported direct Ca<sup>2+</sup> effects on phospholipase C or on intracellular channels mediating calcium-induced calcium release.",

The picture that emerges from our work is that of a competition between photoswitching and nonproductive reaction pathways. We found that photoswitching had a low quantum yield of 0.4%. It involves electron transfer from a tyrosine residue (Tyr203) to the chromophore and is completed in 33 ns. Nonproductive deactivation pathways comprise recombination of a charge transfer intermediate, excited-state proton transfer from the chromophore to a histidine residue (His145), and decay to the ground state via micro-/millisecond-lived intermediates.",

It is associated with developing asymmetric morphological structures that underlie key biological functions such as cell division, growth, and migration. In addition, the disruption of cell polarity has been linked to tissue-related disorders such as cancer and gastric dysplasia. Current methods to evaluate the spatiotemporal dynamics of fluorescent reporters in individual polarized cells often involve manual steps to trace a midline along the cells' major axis, which is time consuming and prone to strong biases. Furthermore, although ratiometric analysis can correct the uneven distribution of reporter molecules using two fluorescence channels, background subtraction techniques are frequently arbitrary and lack statistical support. This manuscript introduces a novel computational pipeline to automate and quantify the spatiotemporal behavior of single cells using a model of cell polarity: pollen tube/root hair growth and cytosolic ion dynamics. A three-step algorithm was developed to process ratiometric images and extract a quantitative representation of intracellular dynamics and growth. The first step segments the cell from the background, producing a binary mask through a thresholding technique in the pixel intensity space. The second step traces a path through the midline of the cell through a skeletonization operation. Finally, the third step provides the processed data as a ratiometric timelapse and yields a ratiometric kymograph (i.e., a 1D spatial profile through time). Data from ratiometric images acquired with genetically encoded fluorescent reporters from growing pollen tubes were used to benchmark the method. This pipeline allows for faster, less biased, and more accurate representation of the spatiotemporal dynamics along the midline of polarized cells, thus advancing the quantitative toolkit available to investigate cell polarity.

        "abstract": "Insects constitute the most species-rich radiation of metazoa, a success due to the evolution of active flight. Unlike pterosaurs, birds, and bats, the wings of insects did not evolve from legs <sup>1</sup> , but are novel structures attached to the body via a biomechanically complex hinge that transforms tiny, high-frequency oscillations of specialized power muscles into the sweeping back-and-forth motion of the wings <sup>2</sup> . The hinge consists of a system of tiny, hardened structures called sclerites that are interconnected to one another via flexible joints and regulated by the activity of specialized control muscles. Here, we imaged the activity of these muscles in a fly using a genetically encoded calcium indicator, while simultaneously tracking the 3D motion of the wings with high-speed cameras. Using machine learning approaches, we created a convolutional neural network <sup>3</sup> that accurately predicts wing motion from the activity of the steering muscles, and an encoder-decoder <sup>4</sup> that predicts the role of the individual sclerites on wing motion. By replaying patterns of wing motion on a dynamically scaled robotic fly, we quantified the effects of steering muscle activity on aerodynamic forces. A physics-based simulation that incorporates our model of the hinge generates flight maneuvers that are remarkably similar to those of free flying flies. This integrative, multi-disciplinary approach reveals the mechanical control logic of the insect wing hinge, arguably among the most sophisticated and evolutionarily important skeletal structures in the natural world.",

Patch calcification occurs more rapidly in pediatric patients eventually leading to reoperations. Bacterial cellulose (BC) as a biogenic polymer offers high tensile strength, biocompatibility, and hemocompatibility. Thus, we further investigated the biomechanical properties of BC for use as patch material. The BC-producing bacteria <i>Acetobacter xylinum</i> were cultured in different environments to investigate optimal culturing conditions. For mechanical characterization, an established method of inflation for biaxial testing was used. The applied static pressure and deflection height of the BC patch were measured. Furthermore, a displacement and strain distribution analysis was performed and compared to a standard xenograft pericardial patch. The examination of the culturing conditions revealed that the BC became homogenous and stable when cultivated at 29°C, 60% oxygen concentration, and culturing medium exchange every third day for a total culturing period of 12 days. The estimated elastic modulus of the BC patches ranged from 200 to 530 MPa compared to 230 MPa for the pericardial patch. The strain distributions, calculated from preloaded (2 mmHg) to 80 mmHg inflation, show BC patch strains ranging between 0.6% and 4%, which was comparable to the pericardial patch. However, the pressure at rupture and peak deflection height varied greatly, ranging from 67 to around 200 mmHg and 0.96 to 5.28 mm, respectively. The same patch thickness does not automatically result in the same material properties indicating that the manufacturing conditions have a significant impact on durability. BC patches can achieve comparable results to pericardial patches in terms of strain behavior as well as in the maximum applied pressure that can be withstood without rupture. Bacterial cellulose patches could be a promising material worth further research.",

Here, we present a bioluminescence-based cell-free biosensor, termed enhanced Bioluminescence sensing of Ligand-Unleashed RNA Expression (eBLUE). The eBLUE leveraged antibiotic-responsive transcription factors to regulate the transcription of RNA arrays that can serve as scaffolds for reassembling and activating multiple luciferase fragments. This process converted target recognition into an amplified bioluminescence response, enabling smartphone-based quantification of tetracycline and erythromycin directly in milk within 15 min. Moreover, the detection threshold of eBLUE can be easily tuned according to the maximum residue limits (MRLs) established by government agencies. Owing to this tunable nature, the eBLUE was further repurposed as an on-demand semi-quantification platform, allowing for fast (∼20 min) and software-free identification of safe and MRL-exceeding milk samples only by glancing over the smartphone photographs. Overall, the sensitivity, rapidity and user-friendliness of eBLUE demonstrate its potentials for practical applications, especially in resource-limited and household settings.",

However, subsequent functional analyses of these assemblies have been hindered owing to the lack of genetic tools compatible with this thermophile, which are typically suited to other mesophilic eukaryotic model organisms, in particular the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Hence, we aimed to find genes from C. thermophilum that are expressed under the control of different sugars and examine their associated 5' untranslated regions as promoters responsible for sugar-regulated gene expression. To identify sugar-regulated promoters in C. thermophilum, we performed comparative xylose- versus glucose-dependent gene expression studies, which uncovered a number of enzymes with induced expression in the presence of xylose but repressed expression in glucose-supplemented media. Subsequently, we cloned the promoters of the two most stringently regulated genes, the xylosidase-like gene (XYL) and xylitol dehydrogenase (XDH), obtained from this genome-wide analysis in front of a thermostable yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) reporter. With this, we demonstrated xylose-dependent YFP expression by both Western blotting and live-cell imaging fluorescence microscopy. Prompted by these results, we expressed the C. thermophilum orthologue of a well-characterized dominant-negative ribosome assembly factor mutant, under the control of the XDH promoter, which allowed us to induce a nuclear export defect on the pre-60S subunit when C. thermophilum cells were grown in xylose- but not glucose-containing medium. Altogether, our study identified xylose-regulatable promoters in C. thermophilum, which might facilitate functional studies of genes of interest in this thermophilic eukaryotic model organism.",

To clarify sites of Fgf23 promoter activity in Tmprss6-/- mice, we introduced a heterozygous enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) reporter allele at the endogenous Fgf23 locus. Heterozygous Fgf23 disruption did not alter the severity of systemic iron deficiency or anemia in the Tmprss6-/- mice. Tmprss6-/-Fgf23+/eGFP mice showed green fluorescence in the vascular regions of BM sections and showed a subset of BM endothelial cells that were GFPbright by flow cytometry. Mining of transcriptomic data sets from mice with normal iron balance revealed higher Fgf23 mRNA in BM sinusoidal endothelial cells (BM-SECs) than that in other BM endothelial cell populations. Anti-GFP immunohistochemistry of fixed BM sections from Tmprss6-/-Fgf23+/eGFP mice revealed GFP expression in BM-SECs, which was more intense than in nonanemic controls. In addition, in mice with intact Tmprss6 alleles, Fgf23-eGFP reporter expression increased in BM-SECs following large-volume phlebotomy and also following erythropoietin treatment both ex vivo and in vivo. Collectively, our results identified BM-SECs as a novel site for Fgf23 upregulation in both acute and chronic anemia.

In three experiments collecting over 35,000 judgements on stimuli spanning different levels of realism (line drawings, real images, and crude forms), participants clicked \"where\" an object is, as if pointing to it. We modeled their responses with eight different methods, including both human response-based models (judgements of physical reasoning, spatial memory, free-response \"click anywhere\" judgements, and judgements of where people would grab the object), and image-based models (uniform distributions over the image, convex hull, saliency map, and medial axis). Physical reasoning was the best predictor of \"where,\" performing significantly better than even spatial memory and free-response judgements.

Their rapid spiking enables them to control circuit dynamics on a millisecond time scale, and the timing of their activation by different excitatory pathways is critical to these functions. We used a genetically encoded hybrid voltage sensor to image PV interneuron voltage changes with sub-millisecond precision in primary somatosensory barrel cortex (BC) of adult mice. Electrical stimulation evoked depolarizations with a latency that increased with distance from the stimulating electrode, allowing us to determine conduction velocity. Spread of responses between cortical layers yielded an interlaminar conduction velocity and spread within layers yielded intralaminar conduction velocities in different layers. Velocities ranged from 74 to 473 μm/ms depending on trajectory; interlaminar conduction was 71% faster than intralaminar conduction. Thus, computations within columns are more rapid than between columns. The BC integrates thalamic and intracortical input for functions such as texture discrimination and sensory tuning. Timing differences between intra- and interlaminar PV interneuron activation could impact these functions. Imaging of voltage in PV interneurons reveals differences in signaling dynamics within cortical circuitry.

Here, we used genetically encoded redox probes (roGFP2 and roGFP-iL), targeted to the periplasm, to directly probe the thiol redox homeostasis in this compartment. These probes contain two cysteine residues that are virtually completely reduced in the cytoplasm, but once exported into the periplasm, can form a disulfide bond, a process that can be monitored by fluorescence spectroscopy. Even in the absence of DsbA, roGFP2, exported to the periplasm, was almost fully oxidized, suggesting the presence of an alternative system for the introduction of disulfide bonds into exported proteins. However, the absence of DsbA shifted the steady state periplasmic thiol-redox potential from -228 mV to a more reducing -243 mV and the capacity to re-oxidize periplasmic roGFP2 after a reductive pulse was significantly decreased. Re-oxidation in a DsbA strain could be fully restored by exogenous oxidized glutathione (GSSG), while reduced GSH accelerated re-oxidation of roGFP2 in the WT. In line, a strain devoid of endogenous glutathione showed a more reducing periplasm, and was significantly worse in oxidatively folding PhoA, a native periplasmic protein and substrate of the oxidative folding machinery. PhoA oxidative folding could be enhanced by the addition of exogenous GSSG in the WT and fully restored in a ΔdsbA mutant.

The acquired image-data stacks from biological experiments containing phase contrast and fluorescence intensity data were analyzed using in-house developed and open-source image-analysis tools. The resulting oxygen concentration could be dynamically controlled between 0% and 100%. The system was experimentally tested by culturing and analyzing an <i>E. coli</i> strain expressing green fluorescent protein as an indirect intracellular oxygen indicator. The presented system allows for innovative microbiological research on microorganisms and microbial ecology with single-cell resolution.",

        "abstract": "Speciation of thallium (Tl) controls its fate and biogeochemical behaviors. Thus, a sensitive and accurately approach for Tl monitoring is of great demand due to its ultra-low concentration and sensitivity to redox change. In this study, diffusive gradients in thin-films technique (DGT) assembled with novel titanium peroxide (TP) binding gels (TP-DGT) was developed for in situ measurement of dissolved Tl(I) and Tl(III) in waters and sediments. Laboratory test showed a linear mass accumulation of Tl(I) and Tl(III) on the TP binding gels with the deployment time from 4 to 72 h. A fascinating performance of this novel DGT was achieved in a pH range of 4-9, ionic strength range of 0.1-200 mmol L<sup>-1</sup>, and humic acid concentration of 0-30 mg L<sup>-1</sup> with a low detection limit of 0.3 ng L<sup>-1</sup> for Tl(I) and 0.6 ng L<sup>-1</sup> for Tl(III). The TP binding gels own excellent stability (1-365 d) and high capacity (73.5 μg Tl disc<sup>-1</sup>) which are suitable for long-term monitoring. Field application in a river indicated that TP-DGT could work effectively, comparable to the grab sampling in waters. For the first time, the TP-DGT coupled with oxygen optode was successfully applied to map 2D distribution patterns of Tl and oxygen simultaneously in the rhizosphere of M. verticillatum L. This study confirms TP-DGT is a promising tool for routine monitoring of Tl in waters and for investigating biogeochemical processes of Tl in sediments.",

However, the HEK 293 cell line and its derivatives endogenously express the NGFR protein. To eradicate the high background NGFR expression in future retroviral vector packaging cells, we here employed the CRISPR/Cas9 system to generate human suspension 293-F NGFR knockout cells. The expression of a fluorescent protein coupled via a 2A peptide motif to the NGFR targeting Cas9 endonuclease enabled the simultaneous depletion of cells expressing Cas9 and remaining NGFR-positive cells.

        "abstract": "Mitochondria are susceptible to damage resulting from their activity as energy providers. Damaged mitochondria can cause harm to the cell and thus mitochondria are subjected to elaborate quality-control mechanisms including elimination via lysosomal degradation in a process termed mitophagy. Basal mitophagy is a house-keeping mechanism fine-tuning the number of mitochondria according to the metabolic state of the cell. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying basal mitophagy remain largely elusive. In this study, we visualized and assessed the level of mitophagy in H9c2 cardiomyoblasts at basal conditions and after OXPHOS induction by galactose adaptation. We used cells with a stable expression of a pH-sensitive fluorescent mitochondrial reporter and applied state-of-the-art imaging techniques and image analysis. Our data showed a significant increase in acidic mitochondria after galactose adaptation. Using a machine-learning approach we also demonstrated increased mitochondrial fragmentation by OXPHOS induction. Furthermore, super-resolution microscopy of live cells enabled capturing of mitochondrial fragments within lysosomes as well as dynamic transfer of mitochondrial contents to lysosomes. Applying correlative light and electron microscopy we revealed the ultrastructure of the acidic mitochondria confirming their proximity to the mitochondrial network, ER and lysosomes. Finally, exploiting siRNA knockdown strategy combined with flux perturbation with lysosomal inhibitors, we demonstrated the importance of both canonical as well as non-canonical autophagy mediators in lysosomal degradation of mitochondria after OXPHOS induction. Taken together, our high-resolution imaging approaches applied on H9c2 cells provide novel insights on mitophagy during physiologically relevant conditions. The implication of redundant underlying mechanisms highlights the fundamental importance of mitophagy.<b>Abbreviations:</b> ATG: autophagy related; ATG7: autophagy related 7; ATP: adenosine triphosphate; BafA1: bafilomycin A<sub>1</sub>; CLEM: correlative light and electron microscopy; EGFP: enhanced green fluorescent protein; MAP1LC3B: microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3 beta; OXPHOS: oxidative phosphorylation; PepA: pepstatin A; PLA: proximity ligation assay; PRKN: parkin RBR E3 ubiquitin protein ligase; RAB5A: RAB5A, member RAS oncogene family; RAB7A: RAB7A, member RAS oncogene family; RAB9A: RAB9A, member RAS oncogene family; ROS: reactive oxygen species; SIM: structured illumination microscopy; siRNA: short interfering RNA; SYNJ2BP: synaptojanin 2 binding protein; TEM: transmission electron microscopy; TOMM20: translocase of outer mitochondrial membrane 20; ULK1: unc-51 like kinase 1.",

Understanding the contribution of these lineages to mature organisms is a central question of developmental biology. Several techniques to document cell lineages have been used, from marking single cells with mutations that express a visible marker to generating molecular bar codes by CRISPR-induced mutations and subsequent single-cell analysis. Here, we exploit the mutagenic activity of CRISPR to allow lineage tracing within living plants with a single reporter. Cas9-induced mutations are directed to correct a frameshift mutation that restores expression of a nuclear fluorescent protein, labelling the initial cell and all progenitor cells with a strong signal without modifying other phenotypes of the plants. Spatial and temporal control of Cas9 activity can be achieved using tissue-specific and/or inducible promoters. We provide proof of principle for the function of lineage tracing in two model plants. The conserved features of the components and the versatile cloning system, allowing for easy exchange of promoters, are expected to make the system widely applicable.",

By expressing both a calcium indicator (GCaMP6s) and an optogenetic actuator (ChrimsonR) in foveal RGCs of the macaque, we reactivated RGCs <i>in vivo</i> and assessed their response in the weeks and years following PR loss. We used an <i>in vivo</i> calcium imaging approach to record optogenetically evoked activity in deafferented RGCs in primate fovea. Cellular scale recordings were made longitudinally over a 10 week period following photoreceptor ablation and compared to responses from RGCs that had lost photoreceptor input more than two years prior. Three eyes received photoreceptor ablation, OD of a male <i>Macaca mulatta</i> (M1), OS of a female <i>Macaca fascicularis</i> (M2) and OD of a male <i>Macaca fascicularis</i> (M3). Two animals were used for <i>in vivo</i> recording, one for histological assessment. Cones were ablated with an ultrafast laser delivered through an adaptive optics scanning light ophthalmoscope (AOSLO). A 0.5 s pulse of 25Hz 660nm light optogenetically stimulated RGCs, and the resulting GCaMP fluorescence signal was recorded using AOSLO. Measurements were repeated over 10 weeks immediately after PR ablation, at 2.3 years and in control RGCs. The calcium rise time, decay constant and sensitivity index of optogenetic mediated RGC were derived from GCaMP fluorescence recordings from 221 RGCs (Animal M1) and 218 RGCs (Animal M2) <i>in vivo</i>. Following photoreceptor ablation, the mean decay constant of the calcium response in RGCs decreased 1.5 fold (1.6±0.5 s to 0.6±0.3 s SD) over the 10 week observation period in subject 1 and 2.1 fold (2.5±0.5 s to 1.2±0.2 s SD) within 8 weeks in subject 2. Calcium rise time and sensitivity index were stable. Optogenetic reactivation remained possible 2.3 years after PR ablation. Altered calcium dynamics developed in primate foveal RGCs in the weeks after photoreceptor ablation. The mean decay constant of optogenetic mediated calcium responses decreased 1.5 - 2-fold. This is the first report of this phenomenon in primate retina and further work is required to understand the role these changes play in cell survival and activity.",

These neurons set the balance between excitation and inhibition, control rhythmic activity, and have been linked to disorders including autism spectrum and schizophrenia. PV interneurons differ between cortical layers in their morphology, circuitry, and function, but how their electrophysiological properties vary has received little attention. Here we investigate responses of PV interneurons in different layers of primary somatosensory barrel cortex (BC) to different excitatory inputs. With the genetically-encoded hybrid voltage sensor, hVOS, we recorded voltage changes simultaneously in many L2/3 and L4 PV interneurons to stimulation in either L2/3 or L4. Decay-times were consistent across L2/3 and L4. Amplitude, half-width, and rise-time were greater for PV interneurons residing in L2/3 compared to L4. Stimulation in L2/3 elicited responses in both L2/3 and L4 with longer latency compared to stimulation in L4. These differences in latency between layers could influence their windows for temporal integration. Thus PV interneurons in different cortical layers of BC show differences in response properties with potential roles in cortical computations.",

The mechanism and purpose behind microglial calcium signaling is not known.

UDP signals to the microglial P2Y<sub>6</sub> receptor for broad increases in calcium signaling during epileptogenesis. UDP-P2Y<sub>6</sub> signaling is necessary for lysosome upregulation across limbic brain regions and enhances production of pro-inflammatory cytokines-TNFα and IL-1β. Failures in lysosome upregulation, observed in P2Y<sub>6</sub> KO mice, can also be phenocopied by attenuating microglial calcium signaling in Calcium Extruder (\"CalEx\") mice. In the hippocampus, only microglia with P2Y<sub>6</sub> expression can perform full neuronal engulfment, which substantially reduces CA3 neuron survival and impairs cognition.

However, our understanding of these processes is limited by challenges of using fluorescent protein reporters in their native environment, because they must be exported and fold correctly to become fluorescent. Here, we demonstrate the feasibility of using the monomeric superfolder GFP (msfGFP) exported from <i>S. aureus.</i> By fusing msfGFP to signal peptides for the Secretory (Sec) and Twin Arginine Translocation (Tat) pathways, the two major secretion pathways in <i>S. aureus,</i> we quantified msfGFP fluorescence in bacterial cultures and cell-free supernatant from the cultures. When fused to a Tat signal peptide, we detected msfGFP fluorescence inside but not outside bacterial cells, indicating a failure to export msfGFP. However, when fused to a Sec signal peptide, msfGFP fluorescence was present outside cells, indicating successful export of the msfGFP in the unfolded state, followed by extracellular folding and maturation to the photoactive state. We applied this strategy to study coagulase (Coa), a secreted protein and a major contributor to the formation of a fibrin network in <i>S. aureus</i> biofilms that protects bacteria from the host immune system and increases attachment to host surfaces. We confirmed that a genomically integrated C-terminal fusion of Coa to msfGFP does not impair the activity of Coa or its localisation within the biofilm matrix. Our findings demonstrate that msfGFP is a good candidate fluorescent reporter to consider when studying proteins secreted by the Sec pathway in <i>S. aureus</i>.",

However, no previous studies have examined circadian rhythms in ME/CFS using cellular models or studied the role of cytokines on circadian rhythms. In this study, we used serum samples previously collected from ME/CFS patients (n = 20) selected for the presence of insomnia symptoms and matched controls (n = 20) to determine the effects of serum factors and TGFB on circadian rhythms in NIH3T3 mouse immortalized fibroblasts stably transfected with the Per2-luc bioluminescent circadian reporter. Compared to control serum, ME/CFS serum caused a significant loss of rhythm robustness (decreased goodness of fit) and nominally increased the rate of damping of cellular rhythms. Damping rate was associated with insomnia severity in ME/CFS patients using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Recombinant TGFB1 peptide applied to cells reduced rhythm amplitude, caused phase delay and decreased robustness of rhythms. However, there was no difference in TGFB1 levels between ME/CFS and control serum indicating the effects of serum on cellular rhythms cannot be explained by levels of this cytokine.

To overcome this limitation, we developed a nanobody-based intermolecular tension FRET biosensor capable of measuring the mechanical strain of lamin filaments. Using this sensor, we were able to show that the nuclear lamina is subjected to significant force. These forces are dependent on nuclear volume, actomyosin contractility, functional LINC complex, chromatin condensation state, cell cycle, and EMT. Interestingly, large forces were also present on nucleoplasmic lamins, indicating that these lamins may also have an important mechanical role in the nucleus.

Applicability of this novel technique was further demonstrated by assessing redox states in <i>C. glutamicum</i> colonies using the FRP Mrx1-roGFP2.

        "abstract": "<b>Background:</b> The most obvious manifestation of amyloidoses is the accumulation of amyloid fibrils as plaques in tissues and organs, which always leads to a noticeable deterioration in the patients' condition and is the main marker of the disease. For this reason, early diagnosis of amyloidosis is difficult, and inhibition of fibrillogenesis, when mature amyloids are already accumulated in large quantities, is ineffective. A new direction for amyloidosis treatment is the development of approaches aimed at the degradation of mature amyloid fibrils. In the present work, we investigated possible consequences of amyloid's degradation. <b>Methods:</b> We analyzed the size and morphology of amyloid degradation products by transmission and confocal laser scanning microscopy, their secondary structure and spectral properties of aromatic amino acids, intrinsic chromophore sfGFP, and fibril-bound amyloid-specific probe thioflavin T (ThT) by the absorption, fluorescence and circular dichroism spectroscopy, as well as the cytotoxicity of the formed protein aggregates by MTT-test and their resistance to ionic detergents and boiling by SDS-PAGE. <b>Results:</b> On the example of sfGFP fibrils (model fibrils, structural rearrangements of which can be detected by a specific change in the spectral properties of their chromophore), and pathological Aβ-peptide (Aβ42) fibrils, leading to neuronal death in Alzheimer's disease, the possible mechanisms of amyloids degradation after exposure to factors of different nature (proteins with chaperone and protease activity, denaturant, and ultrasound) was demonstrated. Our study shows that, regardless of the method of fibril degradation, the resulting species retain some amyloid's properties, including cytotoxicity, which may even be higher than that of intact amyloids. <b>Conclusion:</b> The results of our work indicate that the degradation of amyloid fibrils <i>in vivo</i> should be treated with caution since such an approach can lead not to recovery, but to aggravation of the disease.",

DEBIT selectively recognizes the G4 structure with the advantage of strong binding affinity, high selectivity, and excellent photostability.

These natural mechanisms can be sourced by researchers to build Biological Sensors (BioS) by combining them with an easily measurable output, such as fluorescence. Because they are genetically encoded, BioS are cheap, fast, sustainable, portable, self-generating and highly sensitive and specific. Therefore, BioS hold the potential to become key enabling tools that stimulate innovation and scientific exploration in various disciplines. However, the main bottleneck in unlocking the full potential of BioS is the fact that there is no standardized, efficient and tunable platform available for the high-throughput construction and characterization of biosensors. Therefore, a modular, Golden Gate-based construction platform, called MoBioS, is introduced in this article. It allows for the fast and easy creation of transcription factor-based biosensor plasmids. As a proof of concept, its potential is demonstrated by creating eight different, functional and standardized biosensors that detect eight diverse molecules of industrial interest. In addition, the platform contains novel built-in features to facilitate fast and efficient biosensor engineering and response curve tuning.",

While the cytotoxic mechanism of GTX on eukaryotes is well understood, its interaction with bacteria is not yet fully comprehended. The study discovered that S. epidermidis displayed a higher uptake rate of GTX than E.coli. However, Gram-negative bacteria required higher doses of GTX than Gram-positive bacteria to experience the bactericidal effect, which occurred within 4 h for both types of bacteria. The treatment of bioluminescent sensor E.coli MG1655 pKatG-lux with GTX resulted in oxidative stress. Pre-incubation with the antioxidant Trolox did not increase the GTX inhibitory dose, however, slightly increased the bacterial growth rate comparing to GTX alone. At the same time, we found that GTX inhibitory dose was significantly increased by the pretreatment of bacteria with 2-mercaptoethanol and reduced glutathione. Using another biosensor, E. coli MG1655 pIpbA-lux, we showed that bacteria treated with GTX exhibited heat shock stress.

Here, we present the first global multi-variable collection of documentary climate records. The dataset DOCU-CLIM comprises 621 time series (both published and hitherto unpublished) providing information on historical variations in temperature, precipitation, and wind regime. The series are evaluated by formulating proxy forward models (i.e., predicting the documentary observations from climate fields) in an overlapping period. Results show strong correlations, particularly for the temperature-sensitive series. Correlations are somewhat lower for precipitation-sensitive series. Overall, we ascribe considerable potential to documentary records as climate data, especially in regions and seasons not well represented by early instrumental data and palaeoclimate proxies.",

To detect and trace Vgll4-expressing cells and their progeny, we generated and characterized a new tamoxifen-inducible Dre knock-in mouse line, Vgll4-DreER. This mouse line expressed DreER (Dre recombinase fused to the estrogen receptor) under the control of the endogenous Vgll4 promoter. After crossing the Vgll4-DreER mouse line with the Dre-responsive reporter H11-rRFP, Dre-mediated recombination in the tissue was monitored on the basis of red fluorescent protein (RFP) signals, which indicated the distribution of VGLL4-positive cells in vivo. Our data revealed that VGLL4 is widely expressed in various cell types at embryonic and neonatal stages. After comparison with our previously reported Vgll4-GFP mouse, we found that the RFP signal profile was wider than the green fluorescent protein (GFP) pattern, indicating that Vgll4-DreER is more sensitive for labeling VGLL4-expressing cells. We next used a dual-recombination system to simultaneously label VGLL4- and keratin 5 (KRT5)-positive cell populations, and no crosstalk was observed in the Krt5-CreER;Vgll4-DreER;R26-rGlR mice. Taken together, the Vgll4-DreER mouse line is a valuable new tool for examining the precise VGLL4 expression profile and conditional manipulating of VGLL4-expressing cells and their progeny.",

The miR164 family is highly conserved in plants and the miR164-NAM/ATAF/CUC (NAC) module is validated to regulate leaf and flower development, lateral root initiation and stress response. However, our knowledge of its role in Populus remains limited. In this study, two mature miRNA species, miR164e-5p and miR164e-3p, were identified in Populus deltoides. Their nucleotide sequences were identical to those of miR164a/b/c/d/e-5p and miR164b/e-3p in P. tremula × P. alba clone 717-1B4 (hereinafter poplar 717), respectively. Transgenic plants of poplar 717, including overexpression lines (35S::pri-miR164e) and Short Tandem Target Mimic lines (STTM-miR164a-d,e-5p and STTM-miR164b/e-3p), were generated to study the roles of miR164e-5p and miR164e-3p in poplar. Compared with poplar 717, the leaf margins of 35S::pri-miR164e lines were smoother, the leaves of STTM-miR164b/e-3p line were more serrated, while the leaf morphology of STTM-miR164a-d,e-5p lines had no obvious change. In addition, both 35S::pri-miR164e and STTM-miR164b/e-3p plants had a dwarf phenotype. Expressions of miR164a-d,e-5p target genes, including PtaCUC2a, PtaCUC2b and PtaORE1, was significantly reduced in the apex of 35S::pri-miR164e lines. Green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter assay showed that PtaCUC2a/2b and PtaORE1 were cleaved by miR164a-d,e-5p, and the cleavage was inhibited by STTM-miR164b/e-3p. Therefore, miR164b/e-3p may cooperate with miR164a-d,e-5p to regulate certain NAC members, such as PtaCUC2a/2b and PtaORE1, thereby regulating leaf development and plant growth in poplar.

However, the non-canonical codon usage of <i>S. stipitis</i> is an obstacle for implementing molecular tools that were developed for other yeast species, thereby limiting the molecular toolset available for <i>S. stipitis</i>. Here, we developed a series of molecular tools for <i>S. stipitis</i> including BLINCAR, a Bio-Luminescent Indicator that is Nullified by Cas9-Actuated Recombination, which can be used repeatedly to add different exogenous DNA payloads to the wild-type <i>S. stipitis</i> genome or used repeatedly to remove multiple native <i>S. stipitis</i> genes from the wild-type genome. Through the use of BLINCAR tools, one first produces antibiotic-resistant, bioluminescent colonies of <i>S. stipitis</i> whose bioluminescence highlights those clones that have been genetically modified; then second, once candidate clones have been confirmed, one uses a transient Cas9-producing plasmid to nullify the antibiotic resistance and bioluminescent markers from the prior introduction, thereby producing non-bioluminescent colonies that highlight those clones which have been re-sensitized to the antibiotic and are therefore susceptible to another round of BLINCAR implementation. IMPORTANCE Cellulose and hemicellulose that comprise a large portion of sawdust, leaves, and grass can be valuable sources of fermentable sugars for ethanol production. However, some of the sugars liberated from hemicellulose (like xylose) are not easily fermented using conventional glucose-fermenting yeast like <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, so engineering robust xylose-fermenting yeast that is not inhibited by other components liberated from cellulose/hemicellulose will be important for maximizing yield and making lignocellulosic ethanol fermentation cost efficient. The yeast <i>Scheffersomyces stipitis</i> is one such yeast that can ferment xylose; however, it possesses several barriers to genetic manipulation. It is difficult to transform, has only a few antibiotic resistance markers, and uses an alternative genetic code from most other organisms. We developed a genetic toolset for <i>S. stipitis</i> that lowers these barriers and allows a user to deliver and/or delete multiple genetic elements to/from the wild-type genome, thereby expanding <i>S. stipitis's</i> potential.",

With the specific recognition of AMP and phage-Apo@CP, the biosensor for the target Escherichia coli O157:H7 (E. coli O157:H7) presented multi-mode (bioluminescent, colorimetric, and electrochemical) signals to simultaneously measure live and dead bacteria.

In mice, Tregs in the skin are characterized by high expression of CD103, the αE integrin. Evidence indicates that CD103 promotes Treg retention within the skin, although the mechanism underlying this effect is unknown. The main ligand of CD103, E-cadherin, is predominantly expressed by cells in the epidermis. However, because Tregs are predominantly located within the dermis, the nature of the interactions between E-cadherin and CD103-expressing Tregs is unclear. In this study, we used multiphoton intravital microscopy to examine the contribution of CD103 to Treg behavior in resting and inflamed skin of mice undergoing oxazolone-induced contact hypersensitivity. Inhibition of CD103 in uninflamed skin did not alter Treg behavior, whereas 48 h after inducing contact hypersensitivity by oxazolone challenge, CD103 inhibition increased Treg migration. This coincided with E-cadherin upregulation on infiltrating myeloid leukocytes in the dermis. Using CD11c-enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP) × Foxp3-GFP dual-reporter mice, inhibition of CD103 was found to reduce Treg interactions with dermal dendritic cells. CD103 inhibition also resulted in increased recruitment of effector CD4+ T cells and IFN-γ expression in challenged skin and resulted in reduced glucocorticoid-induced TNFR-related protein expression on Tregs. These results demonstrate that CD103 controls intradermal Treg migration, but only at later stages in the inflammatory response, when E-cadherin expression in the dermis is increased, and provide evidence that CD103-mediated interactions between Tregs and dermal dendritic cells support regulation of skin inflammation.",

Utilizing these methods, a library of hormones have been synthesized and tested in a green fluorescent protein reporter assay for their ability to relieve repression by the repressor ScbR. This allowed the most quantitative structure-activity relationship of γ-butyrolactones and a cognate repressor to date. Bioinformatics analysis strongly suggests that many other repressors of NP biosynthesis likely bind similar molecules. This efficient, diversifiable synthesis will enable further investigation of the regulation of NP biosynthesis.",

However, plasma AVP remains elevated despite progressive hypoosmolality. This study investigated changes to inhibitory control of supraoptic nucleus (SON) AVP neurons during liver cirrhosis. Experiments were conducted with adult male Sprague-Dawley rats. Bile duct ligation was used as a model of chronic liver cirrhosis. An adeno-associated virus containing a construct with an AVP promoter and either green fluorescent protein (GFP) or a ratiometric chloride indicator, ClopHensorN, was bilaterally injected into the SON of rats. After 2 weeks, rats received either BDL or sham surgery, and liver cirrhosis was allowed to develop for 4 weeks. In vitro, loose patch recordings of action potentials were obtained from GFP-labeled and unlabeled SON neurons in response to a brief focal application of the GABA<sub>A</sub> agonist muscimol (100 μM). Changes to intracellular chloride ([Cl]i) following muscimol application were determined by changes to the fluorescence ratio of ClopHensorN. The contribution of cation chloride cotransporters NKCC1 and KCC2 to changes in intracellular chloride was investigated using their respective antagonists, bumetanide (BU, 10 μM) and VU0240551 (10 μM). Plasma osmolality and hematocrit were measured as a marker of dilutional hyponatremia. The results showed reduced or absent GABA<sub>A</sub> -mediated inhibition in a greater proportion of AVP neurons from BDL rats as compared to sham rats (100% inhibition in sham vs. 47% in BDL, p = .001). Muscimol application was associated with increased [Cl]i in most cells from BDL as compared to cells from sham rats (χ<sup>2</sup>  = 30.24, p < .001). NKCC1 contributed to the impaired inhibition observed in BDL rats (p < .001 BDL - BU vs. BDL + BU). The results show that impaired inhibition of SON AVP neurons and increased intracellular chloride contribute to the sustained dilutional hyponatremia in liver cirrhosis.",

Here, an approach is described to assess mitochondrial function in living yeast cells at cellular and subcellular resolutions using a genetically encoded, minimally invasive, ratiometric biosensor. The biosensor, mitochondria-targeted HyPer7 (mtHyPer7), detects hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in mitochondria. It consists of a mitochondrial signal sequence fused to a circularly permuted fluorescent protein and the H2O2-responsive domain of a bacterial OxyR protein. The biosensor is generated and integrated into the yeast genome using a CRISPR-Cas9 marker-free system, for more consistent expression compared to plasmid-borne constructs. mtHyPer7 is quantitatively targeted to mitochondria, has no detectable effect on yeast growth rate or mitochondrial morphology, and provides a quantitative readout for mitochondrial H2O2 under normal growth conditions and upon exposure to oxidative stress. This protocol explains how to optimize imaging conditions using a spinning-disk confocal microscope system and perform quantitative analysis using freely available software. These tools make it possible to collect rich spatiotemporal information on mitochondria both within cells and among cells in a population. Moreover, the workflow described here can be used to validate other biosensors.",

In this study, we evaluated the efficiency of amphiphilic shuttle peptide S10 for protein delivery and gene editing using SpCas9, and AsCas12a (Cpf1) ribonucleoproteins (RNPs). These approaches were evaluated in proliferating ferret airway basal cells, polarized airway epithelia <i>in vitro</i>, and lungs <i>in vivo</i>, by accessing the editing efficiency using reporter ferrets and measuring indels at the ferret <i>CFTR</i> locus. Our results demonstrate that shuttle peptides efficiently enable delivery of reporter proteins/peptides and gene editing SpCas9 or Cpf1 RNP complexes to ferret airway epithelial cells <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. We measured S10 delivery efficiency of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-nuclear localization signal (NLS) protein or SpCas9 RNP into ferret airway basal cells and fully differentiated ciliated and nonciliated epithelial cells <i>in vitro</i>. <i>In vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> gene editing efficiencies were determined by Cas/LoxP-gRNA RNP-mediated conversion of a <i>ROSA</i>-TG Cre recombinase reporter using transgenic primary cells and ferrets. S10/Cas9 RNP was more effective, relative to S10/Cpf1 RNP at gene editing of the <i>ROSA</i>-TG locus. Intratracheal lung delivery of the S10 shuttle combined with GFP-NLS protein or D-Retro-Inverso (DRI)-NLS peptide demonstrated efficiencies of protein delivery that were ∼3-fold or 14-fold greater, respectively, than the efficiency of gene editing at the <i>ROSA</i>-TG locus using S10/Cas9/LoxP-gRNA. Cpf1 RNPs was less effective than SpCas9 at gene editing of LoxP locus. These data demonstrate the feasibility of shuttle peptide delivery of Cas RNPs to the ferret airways and the potential utility for developing <i>ex vivo</i> stem cell-based and <i>in vivo</i> gene editing therapies for genetic pulmonary diseases such as CF.",

Our imaging results showed that NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup> levels decreased from the early to the late two-cell stage, whereas the levels of the reducing equivalent NADPH increased. Mechanistically, transcriptome profiling suggested that during the two-cell stage, zygotic cells downregulated the expression of genes involved in glucose uptake and glycolysis, and upregulated the expression of genes for pyruvate metabolism in mitochondria and oxidative phosphorylation, with a decline in the expression of two peroxiredoxin genes, Prdx1 and Prdx2. Collectively, with the establishment of in situ metabolic monitoring technology, our study revealed the programming of redox metabolism during ZGA.",

To study this problem, we generated transgenic ants expressing the genetically encoded calcium indicator GCaMP in olfactory sensory neurons. Using two-photon imaging, we mapped complete glomerular responses to four ant alarm pheromones. Alarm pheromones robustly activated ≤6 glomeruli, and activity maps for the three pheromones inducing panic alarm in our study species converged on a single glomerulus. These results demonstrate that, rather than using broadly tuned combinatorial encoding, ants employ precise, narrowly tuned, and stereotyped representations of alarm pheromones. The identification of a central sensory hub glomerulus for alarm behavior suggests that a simple neural architecture is sufficient to translate pheromone perception into behavioral outputs.",

Current methods for measuring bacterial protease activity in milk are insensitive and too slow to be used in routine testing in dairy processing plants. We have designed a novel bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET)-based biosensor to measure the activity of proteases secreted by bacteria in milk. The BRET-based biosensor is highly selective for bacterial protease activity compared with other proteases tested, notably including plasmin, which is abundant in milk. It incorporates a novel peptide linker that is selectively cleaved by P. fluorescens AprX proteases. The peptide linker is flanked by green fluorescent protein (GFP<sup>2</sup>) at the N-terminus and a variant Renilla luciferase (RLuc2) at the C-terminus. Complete cleavage of the linker by bacterial proteases from Pseudomonas fluorescens strain 65, leads to a 95% decrease in the BRET ratio. We applied an azocasein-based calibration method to the AprX biosensor using standard international enzyme activity units. In a 10-min assay, the detection limit for AprX protease activity in buffer was equivalent to 40 pg/mL (≈0.8 pM, 22 μU/mL) and 100 pg/mL (≈2pM, 54 μU/mL) in 50% (v/v) full fat milk. The EC<sub>50</sub> values were 1.1 ± 0.3 ng/mL (87 μU/mL) and 6.8 ± 0.2 ng/mL (540 μU/mL), respectively. The biosensor was approximately 800x more sensitive than the established FITC-Casein method in a 2-h assay, the shortest feasible time for the latter method. The protease biosensor is sensitive and fast enough to be used in production settings. It is suitable for measuring bacterial protease activity in raw and processed milk, to inform efforts to mitigate the effects of heat-stable bacterial proteases and maximise the shelf-life of dairy products.",

Moreover, immunohistochemical analysis suggested that NMU neurons in the VMH mainly constitute a unique population of hypothalamic cells.

Insufficient sensitivity is a long-standing obstacle for imaging low-absorbing chromophores with less photobleaching or toxicity, reduced perturbation to delicate organs, and more choices of low-power lasers. Here, the photoacoustic probe design is collaboratively optimized and a spectral-spatial filter is implemented. A multi-spectral super-low-dose photoacoustic microscopy (SLD-PAM) is presented that improves the sensitivity by ≈33 times. SLD-PAM can visualize microvessels and quantify oxygen saturation in vivo with ≈1% of the maximum permissible exposure, dramatically reducing potential phototoxicity or perturbation to normal tissue function, especially in imaging of delicate tissues, such as the eye and the brain. Capitalizing on the high sensitivity, direct imaging of deoxyhemoglobin concentration is achieved without spectral unmixing, avoiding wavelength-dependent errors and computational noises. With reduced laser power, SLD-PAM can reduce photobleaching by ≈85%. It is also demonstrated that SLD-PAM achieves similar molecular imaging quality using 80% fewer contrast agents. Therefore, SLD-PAM enables the use of a broader range of low-absorbing nano-agents, small molecules, and genetically encoded biomarkers, as well as more types of low-power light sources in wide spectra.

Live-cell biosensors that detect the activity of G proteins in response to GPCR stimulation have emerged as a powerful approach to investigate GPCR/G protein signaling. Here, we detail methods to monitor G protein activity through direct measurement of GTP-bound Gα subunits using optical biosensors based on bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET).

The first protocol explains how to use a multicomponent BRET biosensor that relies on expression of exogenous G proteins in cell lines. This protocol yields robust responses that are compatible with endpoint measurements of dose-dependent ligand effects or with kinetic measurements of subsecond resolution. The second protocol describes the implementation of unimolecular biosensors that detect the activation of endogenous G proteins in cell lines expressing exogenous GPCRs or in primary cells upon stimulation of endogenous GPCRs.

The LightOn system is an optogenetic tool that regulates the expression of a gene of interest using blue light as an inducer.

We adapted a previously published sampling simulation to PIF sampling and benchmarked industry-relevant sampling plans across different numbers of grabs, total sample mass, and sampling patterns. We evaluated performance to detect published Cronobacter contamination profiles for a recalled PIF batch [42% prevalence, -1.8 ± 0.7 log(CFU/g)] and a reference, nonrecalled, PIF batch [1% prevalence, -2.4 ± 0.8 log(CFU/g)]. Simulating a range of numbers of grabs [n = 1-22,000 (representing testing every finished package)] with 300 g total composite mass showed that taking 30 or more grabs detected contamination reliably (<1% median probability to accept the recalled batch). Benchmarking representative sampling plans ([n = 30, mass grab = 10g], [n = 30, m = 25g], [n = 60, m = 25g], [n = 180, m = 25g]) showed that all plans would reject the recalled batch (<1% median probability to accept) but would rarely reject the reference batch (>50% median probability of acceptance, all plans). Overall, (i) systematic or stratified random sampling patterns are equal to or more powerful than random sampling of the same sample size and total sampled mass, and, (ii) taking more samples, even if smaller, can increase the power to detect contamination.",

The development of different mutations in the Ca2+-sensitive elements of the cameleon probes has allowed sensitive range of Ca2+ measurements in almost all cellular compartments. Region of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) tethered to mitochondria, named as the mitochondrial-associated membranes (MAMs), has received an extended attention since the last 5 years. Indeed, as MAMs are essential for calcium homeostasis and mitochondrial function, molecular tools have been developed to assess quantitatively Ca2+ levels in the MAMs. However, sensitivity of the first generation Ca2+ biosensors on the surface of the outer-mitochondrial membrane (OMM) do not allow to measure μM or sub-μM changes in Ca2+ concentration which prevents to measure the native activity (unstimulated exogenously) of endogenous channels. In this study, we assembled a new ratiometric highly sensitive Ca2+ biosensor expressed on the surface of the outer-mitochondrial membrane (OMM). It allows the detection of smaller differences than the previous biosensor in or at proximity of the MAMs. Noteworthy, we demonstrated that IP3-receptors have an endogenous activity which participate to the Ca2+ leak channel on the surface of the OMM during hypoxia or when SERCA activity is blocked.",

Models were developed for estimation of two human-associated fecal-indicator and three general fecal-indicator bacteria (HIB and FIB) using in situ optical field-sensor data for estimating concentrations and loads of HIB and FIB and the extent of sewage contamination in the Menomonee River in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Three commercially available optical sensor platforms were installed into an unfiltered custom-designed flow-through system along with a refrigerated automatic sampler at the Menomonee River sampling location. Ten-minute optical sensor measurements were made from November 2017 to December 2018 along with the collection of 153 flow-weighted discrete water samples (samples) for HIB, FIB, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and optical properties of water. Of those 153 samples, 119 samples were from event-runoff periods, and 34 were collected during low-flow periods. Of the 119 event-runoff samples, 43 samples were from event-runoff combined sewer overflow (CSO) influenced periods (event-CSO periods). Models included optical sensor measurements as explanatory variables with a seasonal variable as an interaction term. In some cases, separate models for event-CSO periods and non CSO-periods generally improved model performance, as compared to using all the data combined for estimates of FIB and HIB. Therefore, the CSO and non-CSO models were used in final estimations for CSO and non-CSO time periods, respectively. Estimated continuous concentrations for all bacteria markers varied over six orders of magnitude during the study period. The greatest concentrations, loads, and proportion of sewage contamination occurred during event-runoff and event-CSO periods. Comparison to water quality standards and microbial risk assessment benchmarks indicated that estimated bacteria levels exceeded recreational water quality criteria between 34 and 96% of the entire monitoring period, highlighting the benefits of high-frequency monitoring compared to traditional grab sample collection. The application of optical sensors for estimation of HIB and FIB markers provided a thorough assessment of bacterial presence and human health risk in the Menomonee River.",

The current report describes a female patient with a sudden syncope and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy phenotype. We identified the pathogenic mutations in patients by whole-exon sequencing, followed by a series of molecular biology and genetic approaches to identify and functional analysis of the mutations. Suggestive findings by cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR), electrocardiogram (ECG), and laboratory examination suggested Danon disease which was confirmed by genetic testing. The patient carried a novel de novo mutation, LAMP2 c.2T>C located at the initiation codon. The quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and Western blot (WB) analysis of peripheral blood leukocytes from the patients revealed evidence of LAMP2 haploinsufficiency. Labeling of the new initiation codon predicted by the software with green fluorescent protein followed by fluorescence microscopy and Western blotting showed that the first ATG downstream from the original initiation codon became the new translational initiation codon. The three-dimensional structure of the mutated protein predicted by alphafold2 revealed that it consisted of only six amino acids and failed to form a functional polypeptide or protein. Overexpression of the mutated LAMP2 c.2T>C showed a loss of function of the protein, as assessed by the dual-fluorescence autophagy indicator system. The mutation was confirmed to be null, AR experiments and sequencing results confirmed that 28% of the mutant X chromosome remained active. We propose possible mechanisms of mutations associated with haploinsufficiency of LAMP2: (1) The inactivation X chromosome carrying the mutation was not significantly skewed. However, it decreased in the mRNA level and the expression ratio of the mutant transcripts; (2) The identified mutation is null, and the active mutant transcript fails to translate into the normal LAMP2 proteins. The presence of haploinsufficiency in LAMP2 and the X chromosome inactivation pattern were crucial factors contributing to the early onset of Danon disease in this female patient.",

The number and subtype of surface NMDARs are regulated at several levels, including their externalization, internalization, and lateral diffusion between the synaptic and extrasynaptic regions. Here, we used novel anti-GFP (green fluorescent protein) nanobodies conjugated to either the smallest commercially available quantum dot 525 (QD525) or the several nanometer larger (and thus brighter) QD605 (referred to as nanoGFP-QD525 and nanoGFP-QD605, respectively). Targeting the yellow fluorescent protein-tagged GluN1 subunit in rat hippocampal neurons, we compared these two probes to a previously established larger probe, a rabbit anti-GFP IgG together with a secondary IgG conjugated to QD605 (referred to as antiGFP-QD605). The nanoGFP-based probes allowed faster lateral diffusion of the NMDARs, with several-fold increased median values of the diffusion coefficient (<i>D</i>). Using thresholded tdTomato-Homer1c signals to mark synaptic regions, we found that the nanoprobe-based <i>D</i> values sharply increased at distances over 100 nm from the synaptic edge, while <i>D</i> values for antiGFP-QD605 probe remained unchanged up to a 400 nm distance. Using the nanoGFP-QD605 probe in hippocampal neurons expressing the GFP-GluN2A, GFP-GluN2B, or GFP-GluN3A subunits, we detected subunit-dependent differences in the synaptic localization of NMDARs, <i>D</i> value, synaptic residence time, and synaptic-extrasynaptic exchange rate. Finally, we confirmed the applicability of the nanoGFP-QD605 probe to study differences in the distribution of synaptic NMDARs by comparing to data obtained with nanoGFPs conjugated to organic fluorophores, using universal point accumulation imaging in nanoscale topography and direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy.<b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Our study systematically compared the localization and mobility of surface NMDARs containing GFP-GluN2A, GFP-GluN2B, or GFP-GluN3A subunits expressed in rodent hippocampal neurons, using anti-green fluorescent protein (GFP) nanobodies conjugated to the quantum dot 605 (nanoGFP-QD605), as well as nanoGFP probes conjugated with small organic fluorophores. Our comprehensive analysis showed that the method used to delineate the synaptic region plays an important role in the study of synaptic and extrasynaptic pools of NMDARs. In addition, we showed that the nanoGFP-QD605 probe has optimal parameters for studying the mobility of NMDARs because of its high localization accuracy comparable to direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy and longer scan time compared with universal point accumulation imaging in nanoscale topography. The developed approaches are readily applicable to the study of any GFP-labeled membrane receptors expressed in mammalian neurons.",

        "abstract": "Single-molecule force spectroscopy (SMFS) is powerful for studying folding states and mechanical properties of proteins, however, it requires protein immobilization onto force-transducing probes such as cantilevers or microbeads. A common immobilization method relies on coupling lysine residues to carboxylated surfaces using 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethyl-aminopropyl) carbodiimide and N-hydroxysuccinimide (EDC/NHS). Because proteins typically contain many lysine groups, this strategy results in a heterogeneous distribution of tether positions. Genetically encoded peptide tags (e.g., ybbR) provide alternative chemistries for achieving site-specific immobilization, but thus far a direct comparison of site-specific vs. lysine-based immobilization strategies to assess effects on the observed mechanical properties was lacking. Here, we compared lysine- vs. ybbR-based protein immobilization in SMFS assays using several model polyprotein systems. Our results show that lysine-based immobilization results in significant signal deterioration for monomeric streptavidin-biotin interactions, and loss of the ability to correctly classify unfolding pathways in a multipathway Cohesin-Dockerin system. We developed a mixed immobilization approach where a site-specifically tethered ligand was used to probe surface-bound proteins immobilized through lysine groups, and found partial recovery of specific signals. The mixed immobilization approach represents a viable alternative for mechanical assays on in vivo-derived samples or other proteins of interest where genetically encoded tags are not feasible.",

Adeno-associated virus (AAV) has been widely used for <i>in vivo</i> gene therapy, but its limited 4.7 kb packing capacity presents challenges in delivering CBE by a single AAV. To address this, one feasible solution is to split CBE into two sections for dual-AAV delivery.

These split-BE3 pairs were initially screened in the green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter system, with six split-BE3 pairs selected for further evaluation. The subsequent screening of split-BE3 pairs was performed at two endogenous sites in 293T and HeLa cells, revealing that the split-BE3-Rma674, split-BE3-Rma713, and split-BE3-Rma1005 displayed effective C-to-T conversion after transfection. The effectiveness of dual-AAV split-BE3 was further validated in culture cells and adult mouse eyes.

Previous research has focused on explaining how cooperation in social dilemmas can be maintained by direct and indirect reciprocity among the participants of the social dilemma. However, in complex human societies, both modern and ancient, cooperation is frequently maintained by means of specialized third-party enforcement. We provide an evolutionary-game-theoretic model that explains how specialized third-party enforcement of cooperation (specialized reciprocity) can emerge. A population consists of producers and enforcers. First, producers engage in a joint undertaking represented by a prisoner's dilemma. They are paired randomly and receive no information about their partner's history, which precludes direct and indirect reciprocity. Then, enforcers tax producers and may punish their clients. Finally, the enforcers are randomly paired and may try to grab resources from each other. In order to sustain producer cooperation, enforcers must punish defecting producers, but punishing is costly to enforcers. We show that the threat of potential intraenforcer conflict can incentivize enforcers to engage in costly punishment of producers, provided they are sufficiently informed to maintain a reputation system. That is, the \"guards\" are guarded by the guards themselves. We demonstrate the key mechanisms analytically and corroborate our results with numerical simulations.",

However, in 2022, an alarming number of MPXV cases were reported globally, with evidence of person-to-person transmission. Because of this, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the MPXV outbreak a public health emergency of international concern. The supply of MPXV vaccines is limited, and only two antivirals, tecovirimat and brincidofovir, approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of smallpox, are currently available for the treatment of MPXV infection. Here, we evaluated 19 compounds previously shown to inhibit different RNA viruses for their ability to inhibit orthopoxvirus infections. We first used recombinant vaccinia virus (rVACV) expressing fluorescence (mScarlet or green fluorescent protein [GFP]) and luciferase (Nluc) reporter genes to identify compounds with antiorthopoxvirus activity. Seven compounds from the ReFRAME library (antimycin A, mycophenolic acid, AVN-944, pyrazofurin, mycophenolate mofetil, azaribine, and brequinar) and six compounds from the NPC library (buparvaquone, valinomycin, narasin, monensin, rotenone, and mubritinib) showed inhibitory activity against rVACV.

Although smallpox vaccines are effective against MPXV, access to those vaccines is limited. In addition, current antiviral treatment against MPXV infections is limited to the use of the FDA-approved drugs tecovirimat and brincidofovir. Thus, there is an urgent need to identify novel antivirals for the treatment of MPXV infection and other potentially zoonotic orthopoxvirus infections. Here, we show that 13 compounds, derived from two different libraries, previously found to inhibit several RNA viruses, also inhibit VACV.

This study aimed to explore the state of knowledge and awareness of preconception nutritional health in adults within the fertile age range and what they perceived could motivate healthy eating using the self-determination theory as a theoretical framework. We analysed 33 short exploratory interviews with men (n = 18) and women (n = 15) aged 18-45 years. Participants were grab sampled from three different public locations in the southern part of Norway. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim in 2020 and analysed using a thematic analysis with a semantic approach in 2022. The findings suggest that adults within the fertile age range are not intrinsically motivated to eat healthily, but when they do, it is because eating healthily often aligns with other goals consistent with their values, that is, getting fit or looking good. They possess some basic knowledge of healthy behaviours during pregnancy but are generally unaware of the importance of preconception health and nutrition. There is a need to increase awareness of the impact of preconception health on the health of this and future generations. Improved nutritional education on the significance of diet before conception might facilitate optimal conditions for conceiving and for pregnancy in the adult population within fertile age range.",

        "abstract": "Bacillus subtilis has been widely used and generally recognized as a safe host for the production of recombinant proteins, high-value chemicals, and pharmaceuticals. Thus, its metabolic engineering attracts significant attention. Nevertheless, the limited availability of selective markers makes this process difficult and time-consuming, especially in the case of multistep biosynthetic pathways. Here, we employ CRISPR/Cas9 technology to build an easy cloning toolkit that addresses commonly encountered obstacles in the metabolic engineering of B. subtilis, including the chromosomal integration locus, promoter, terminator, and guide RNA (gRNA) target. Six promoters were characterized, and the promoter strengths ranged from 0.9- to 23-fold that of the commonly used strong promoter P<i><sub>43</sub></i>. We characterized seven terminators in B. subtilis, and the termination efficiencies (TEs) of the seven terminators are all more than 90%. Six gRNA targets were designed upstream of the promoter and downstream of the terminator. Using a green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter, we confirmed integration efficiency with the single-locus integration site is up to 100%. We demonstrated the applicability of this toolkit by optimizing the expression of a challenging but industrially important product, lycopene. By heterologous expression of the essential genes for lycopene synthesis on the B. subtilis genome, a total of 13 key genes involved in the lycopene biosynthetic pathway were manipulated. Moreover, our findings showed that the gene cluster <i>ispG-idi</i>-<i>dxs</i>-<i>ispD</i> could positively affect the production of lycopene, while the cluster <i>dxr</i>-<i>ispE</i>-<i>ispF</i>-<i>ispH</i> had a negative effect on lycopene production. Hence, our multilocus integration strategy can facilitate the pathway assembly for production of complex chemicals and pharmaceuticals in B. subtilis. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> We present a toolkit that allows for rapid cloning procedures and one-step subcloning to move from plasmid-based expression to stable chromosome integration and expression in a production strain in less than a week. The utility of the customized tool was demonstrated by integrating the MEP (2C-methyl-d-erythritol-4-phosphate) pathway, part of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), and the hetero-lycopene biosynthesis genes by stable expression in the genome. The tool could be useful to engineer B. subtilis strains through diverse recombination events and ultimately improve its potential and scope of industrial application as biological chassis.",

In the last decade, FZKA has been used as an adjuvant treatment for lung cancer in clinical practice. Our previous studies have confirmed that FZKA shows a strong anti-cancer activity, significantly increases the clinical efficacy of gefitinib and reverses gefitinib resistance in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, the molecular mechanism still needs to be further elucidated. The aim of this study was to investigate the role and mechanism by which FZKA inhibited the cell growth, proliferation and invasion of lung adenocarcinoma(LUAD) and reversed the acquired resistance of gefitinib for the therapy in LUAD. Cell viability assay and EDU assay were used for detecting of cell viability and cell proliferation. Transwell assay was performed to measure cell invasion. Western Blot and qRT-PCR were used for protein and gene expression test. The gene promoter activity was determined by dul-luciferase reporter assay. The in situ expression of protein was measured by cell immunofluorescence. Stabilized cell lines were established for stable overexpression of EZH2. Transient transfection assay was used for gene silence and overexpression. Xenograft tumors and bioluminescent imaging were used for in vivo experiments. FZKA significantly inhibited the cell viability, proliferation and cell invasion of LUAD, the combination of FZKA and gefitinib had a great synergy on the above processes. Moreover, FZKA significantly decreased EZH2 mRNA and protein expression, FZKA reversed the resistance of gefitinib by down-regulation of EZH2 protein. ERK1/2 kinase mediated the down-regulation of EZH2 reduced by FZKA. In addition, FZKA decreased the expression of Snail and EGFR by decreasing EZH2. Overexpression of Snail and EGFR significantly reversed the effect of FZKA-inhibited cell invasion and cell proliferation. More important, the combination of FZKA and gefitinib enhanced the inhibitory effect on EZH2, Snail and EGFR proteins. Furthermore, the growth inhibition and reversal of gefitinib resistance induced by FZKA were further validated in vivo. Finally, the expression and clinical correlation of EZH2,EGFR and Snail in cancer patients were further validated using bioinformatics analysis. FZKA significantly suppressed tumor progression and reversed gefitinib resistance by regulating the p-ERK1/2-EZH2-Snail/EGFR signaling pathway in LUAD.",

Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) is becoming an increasingly common monitoring strategy as detection of the genes responsible for cyanotoxin synthesis can be used as an early warning signal. Here we tested passive sampling of cyanobacterial DNA as an alternative to grab sampling in a freshwater drinking supply lake with a known history of microcystin-LR. DNA extracted from grab and passive samples was analyzed via a multiplex qPCR assay that included gene targets for four common cyanotoxins. Passive samples captured similar trends in total cyanobacteria and the mcyE/ndaF gene responsible for microcystin production when compared to traditional grab samples. Passive samples also detected genes associated with the production of cylindrospermopsin and saxitoxin that were not detected in grab samples. This sampling approach proved a viable alternative to grab sampling when used as an early warning monitoring tool. In addition to the logistical benefits of passive sampling, the detection of gene targets not detected by grab samples indicates that passive sampling may allow for a more complete profile of potential cyanotoxin risk.",

P. pileus bioluminescence was studied on board RV Professor Vodyanitsky during its 116th voyage. Sampling live organisms was preceded by probing with the Salpa MA+ probe to register the daily maximum glow in redoxcline, which in this zone was recorded, as a rule, in the depth range of 60-70 m, where dense clusters of P. pileus were formed at that time. The samples of ctenophores were taken by a Bogorov-Rass plankton net. After the net was closed, it was lifted to the surface at a speed of 0.4-0.5 m s<sup>-1</sup> . It was shown that only at a temperature not exceeding 14°C, the P. pileus remained alive for 2-3 days. The data provided indicate that the temperature above 14°C is close to the maximum permissible for P. pileus; therefore, chemical and mechanical stimulation experiments were carried out at this temperature (14°C) to agitate ctenophores luminescence. Though, the nature of their signal was significantly different. The total percentage of luminous organisms from the entire catch was 32.43%, which unequivocally proves that P. pileus glows and makes a significant contribution to the intensity of the glow at great depths in redoxcline.",

Spontaneous ATP release events were tetrodotoxin-insensitive but suppressed by gliotoxin, fluorocitrate, and typically spread over 50-250 μm<sup>2</sup> area at concentrations capable of activating purinergic receptors. Besides, most ATP events did not coincide with Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients, and intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffering with BAPTA-AM did not affect ATP event frequency. Clustering analysis revealed that these events followed multiple distinct kinetics, and blockade of exocytosis only decreased a minor group of slow events.

Unfortunately, methods to discover and characterize suppressor tRNAs are limited because of laborious and time-consuming workflows in living cells. In this work, we develop an<i>Escherichia coli</i> crude extract-based cell-free gene expression system to rapidly express and characterize functional suppressor tRNAs. Our approach co-expresses orthogonal tRNAs using endogenous machinery alongside a stop-codon containing superfolder green fluorescent protein (sfGFP) reporter, which can be used as a simple read-out for suppression. As a model, we evaluate the UAG and UAA suppressing activity of several orthogonal tRNAs. Then, we demonstrate that co-transcription of two mutually orthogonal tRNAs can direct the incorporation of two unique ncAAs within a single modified sfGFP. Finally, we show that the cell-free workflow can be used to discover putative UAG-suppressor tRNAs found in metagenomic data, which are nonspecifically recognized by endogenous aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases.

Trait expression within a community plays an important role in structuring species interactions, highlighting the potential implications of landscape mediated trait changes on ecosystem functioning. Here we test the effect of increasing agricultural landscape modification on defensive and reproductive traits in three commonly occurring Brassicaceae species to evaluate plant responses to landscape change. We collected seeds from populations at spatially separated sites with variation in surrounding agricultural land cover and grew them in a greenhouse common garden, measuring defensive traits through an herbivore no-choice bioassay as well as reproductive traits such as flower size and seed set. In two of the three species, plants originating from agriculturally dominant landscapes expressed a consistent reduction in flower size and herbivore leaf consumption. One species also showed reduced fitness associated with increasingly agricultural landscapes. These findings demonstrate that wild plants are responding to landscape modification, suggesting that the conversion of natural landscapes to agriculture has consequences for wild plant evolution.",

Transgenic animals, although they can have brain-wide GECI expression, often express GECIs in only a small subset of neurons, may have abnormal behavioral phenotypes, and are currently limited to older generations of GECIs. Inspired by recent developments in the synthesis of AAVs that readily cross the blood brain barrier, we tested whether an alternative strategy of intravenously injecting AAV-PHP.eB is suitable for two-photon calcium imaging of neurons over many months after injection. We injected C57BL/6 J mice with AAV-PHP.eB-Synapsin-jGCaMP7s via the retro-orbital sinus.

We found reproducible trial-by-trial neural responses and tuning properties consistent with known feature selectivity in the visual cortex. Thus, intravenous injection of AAV-PHP.eB does not interfere with the normal processing in neural circuits. <i>In vivo</i> and histological images show no nuclear expression of jGCaMP7s for at least 34 weeks post-injection.",

Here, we used a bacteria-mediated recombination approach to construct a full-length infectious cDNA clone, pAd55-FL, containing the whole genome of HadV-55.

The single catalytic domain is shown to reside within the G32-A149 MLuc7 sequence and to be formed by both non-identical repeats, including 10 conserved Cys residues.

The <i>Per1</i> gene is a known key molecular regulator of the mammalian clock system in the autonomous central clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), and the peripheral tissues. <i>Per1::luc</i> Tg mice were used as a biosensing system of circadian rhythms.

The bioluminescent rhythms of the cultured peripheral tissues of the esophagus and the jejunum exhibited phase shift from 5 to 11 h during RF, whereas those of the SCN tissue remained unchanged for 7 days during RF. We examined whether RF for 4 h during the rest period in light conditions could reset the activity rhythms, the central clock in the SCN, and the peripheral clock in the different points in the gastrointestinal tract. The fasting signals during RF did not entrain the SCN, but they did entrain each peripheral clock of the digestive system, the esophagus, and the jejunum. During RF for 7 days, the peak time of the esophagus tended to return to that of the FF control, unlike that of the jejunum; hence, the esophagus was regulated more strongly under the control of the cultured SCN compared to the jejunum.

However, short-term (i.e., sub-weekly) trends in Fe and Mn cycling are less well-understood, as most monitoring efforts focus on longer-term (i.e., monthly to yearly) time scales. The potential for elevated Fe and Mn to degrade water quality and impact ecosystem functioning, coupled with increasing evidence for high spatiotemporal variability in other biogeochemical cycles, necessitates a closer evaluation of the short-term Fe and Mn dynamics in lakes and reservoirs. We adapted a UV-visible spectrophotometer coupled with a multiplexor pumping system and partial least squares regression (PLSR) modeling to generate high spatiotemporal resolution predictions of Fe and Mn concentrations in a drinking water reservoir (Falling Creek Reservoir, Vinton, VA, USA) equipped with a hypolimnetic oxygenation (HOx) system. We quantified hourly Fe and Mn concentrations during two transitional periods: reservoir turnover (Fall 2020) and HOx initiation (Summer 2021). Our sensor system successfully predicted mean Fe and Mn concentrations and trends, ground-truthed by grab sampling and laboratory analysis. During fall turnover, hypolimnetic Fe and Mn concentrations began to decrease more than two weeks before complete mixing of the reservoir, with rapid equalization of epilimnetic and hypolimnetic Fe and Mn concentrations in less than 48 h after full water column mixing. During the initiation of HOx in Summer 2021, Fe and Mn displayed distinctly different responses to oxygenation, as indicated by the rapid oxidation of soluble Fe but not soluble Mn. This study demonstrates that Fe and Mn concentrations are sensitive to changes in redox conditions induced by stratification and oxygenation, although their responses to these changes differ. We also show that high spatio-temporal resolution predictions of Fe and Mn can improve drinking water monitoring programs and reservoir management practices.",

By modifying the metal-binding sites and the fluorescent proteins, several versions of the biosensor were generated and characterized <i>in vitro</i>. The best combination results in a biosensor that is affine and selective for uranium compared to metals such as calcium or other environmental compounds (sodium, magnesium, chlorine). It has a good dynamic range and should be robust to environmental conditions. In addition, its detection limit is below the uranium limit concentration in drinking water defined by the World Health Organization. This genetically encoded biosensor is a promising tool to develop a uranium whole-cell biosensor.

A similar characterization of real-time sub-second dopamine signals in areas outside of the striatum has been limited. Recent advances in fluorescent sensor technology and fiber photometry permit the measurement of dopamine binding correlates, which can divulge basic functions of dopamine signaling in non-striatal dopamine terminal regions, like the dorsal bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (dBNST). Here, we record GRAB<sub>DA</sub> signals in the dBNST during a Pavlovian lever autoshaping task. We observe greater Pavlovian cue-evoked dBNST GRAB<sub>DA</sub> signals in sign-tracking (ST) compared to goal-tracking/intermediate (GT/INT) rats and the magnitude of cue-evoked dBNST GRAB<sub>DA</sub> signals decreases immediately following reinforcer-specific satiety. When we deliver unexpected rewards or omit expected rewards, we find that dBNST dopamine signals encode bidirectional reward prediction errors in GT/INT rats, but only positive prediction errors in ST rats. Since sign- and goal-tracking approach strategies are associated with distinct drug relapse vulnerabilities, we examined the effects of experimenter-administered fentanyl on dBNST dopamine associative encoding. Systemic fentanyl injections do not disrupt cue discrimination but generally potentiate dBNST dopamine signals. These results reveal multiple dBNST dopamine correlates of learning and motivation that depend on the Pavlovian approach strategy employed.",

Recent emergence of probes that circumvent these limitations permits advanced experimental approaches to investigate in situ plastid redox properties. Despite growing evidence of heterogeneity in photosynthetic plastids, investigations have not addressed the potential for spatial variation in redox and/or reactive oxygen dynamics. To study the dynamics of H2O2 in distinct plastid types, we targeted the pH-insensitive, highly specific probe HyPer7 to the plastid stroma in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Using HyPer7 and glutathione redox potential (EGSH) probe for redox-active green fluorescent protein 2 genetically fused to the redox enzyme human glutaredoxin-1 with live cell imaging and optical dissection of cell types, we report heterogeneities in H2O2 accumulation and redox buffering within distinct epidermal plastids in response to excess light and hormone application. Our observations suggest that plastid types can be differentiated by their physiological redox features. These data underscore the variation in photosynthetic plastid redox dynamics and demonstrate the need for cell-type-specific observations in future plastid phenotyping.",

Such non-genomic actions of steroids are rapid and are proposed to be mediated by different ion channels. Transient receptor potential vanilloid sub-type 4 (TRPV4), is a non-specific polymodal ion channel which is involved in several physiological and cellular processes. In this work, we explored the possibilities of Progesterone (P4) as an endogenous ligand for TRPV4. We demonstrate that P4 docks as well as physically interacts with the TM4-loop-TM5 region of TRPV4, a region which is a mutational hotspot for different diseases. Live cell imaging experiments with a genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensor suggests that P4 causes quick influx of Ca<sup>2+</sup> specifically in the TRPV4 expressing cells, which can be partially blocked by TRPV4-specific inhibitor, suggesting that P4 can act as a ligand for TRPV4. Such P4-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup>-influx is altered in cells expressing disease causing TRPV4 mutants, namely in L596P, R616Q, and also in embryonic lethal mutant L618P. P4 dampens, both in terms of \"extent\" as well as the \"pattern\" of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-influx by other stimulus too in cells expressing TRPV4-Wt, suggesting that P4 crosstalk with the TRPV4-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup>-signalling, both in quick and long-term manner. We propose that P4 crosstalk with TRPV4 might be relevant for both acute and chronic pain as well as for other health-related functions.",

Plants possess many CaM-like (CML) proteins, but their binding partners and functions are mostly unknown. Here, using Arabidopsis CML13 as 'bait' in a yeast two-hybrid screen, we isolated putative targets from three, unrelated protein families, namely, IQD proteins, calmodulin-binding transcriptional activators (CAMTAs) and myosins, all of which possess tandem isoleucine-glutamine (IQ) structural domains. Using the split-luciferase complementation assay in planta and the yeast 2-hybrid system, CML13 and CML14 showed a preference for interaction with tandem over single IQ domains. Relative to CaM, CML13 and CML14 displayed weaker signals when tested with the non-IQ, CaM-binding domain of glutamate decarboxylase or the single IQ domains of CNGC20 (cyclic-nucleotide gated channel-20) or IQM1 (IQ motif protein1). We examined IQD14 as a representative tandem IQ-protein and found that only CaM, CML13 and CML14 interacted with IQD14 among 12 CaM/CMLs tested. CaM, CML13 and CML14 bound in vitro to IQD14 in the presence or absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> . Binding affinities were in the nM range and were higher when two tandem IQ domains from IQD14 were present. Green fluorescent protein-tagged versions of CaM, CML13 and CML14 localized to both the cytosol and nucleus in plant cells but were partially relocalized to the microtubules when co-expressed with IQD14 tagged with mCherry. These and other data are discussed in the context of possible roles for these CMLs in gene regulation via CAMTAs and cytoskeletal activity via myosins and IQD proteins.",

Labeled proteins are conjugated in situ with an exogenously supplied nucleophilic probe, which serves as a functional handle for subsequent affinity enrichment and mass spectrometry-based protein identification. From a panel of nucleophilic compounds, we identify biotin-conjugated aniline and propargyl amine as highly reactive probes. As a demonstration of the spatial specificity and depth of coverage in mammalian cells, we apply RinID in the mitochondrial matrix, capturing 477 mitochondrial proteins with 94% specificity. We further demonstrate the broad applicability of RinID in various subcellular compartments, including the nucleus and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The temporal control of RinID enables pulse-chase labeling of ER proteome in HeLa cells, which reveals substantially higher clearance rate for secreted proteins than ER resident proteins.",

This study is the first to confirm near year-round presence and co-occurrence of microcystins (MCs) and domoic acid (DA) within the outskirts of the largest lagoonal US estuary, the Pamlico-Albemarle Sound System (PASS). Monthly sampling at a time-series location in Bogue Sound, located within the eastern part of the PASS, showed DA and MCs were commonly present and detected together 50% of the time based on an in situ toxin tracking approach over a 6-year time period (2015-2020). Particulate toxin concentrations based on monthly grab sampling remained well below regulatory thresholds for MCs and below DA concentrations associated with animal sickness and mortality elsewhere. Time-integrated levels for dissolved MCs and DA, however, indicated a continuous presence of both toxins within Bogue Sound where high flushing rates (∼2-day average residence time) presumably alleviate potential issues linked to nutrient inputs, subsequent algal growth, or toxin accumulation. Pseudo-nitzschia spp. contributed 0 to 19% to the resident microplankton community. Light microscopy analyses did not reveal the source of MCs production in the sound but suggested potential downstream transport and/or autochthonous production due to taxa not accounted for in this study (e.g., picocyanobacteria). Nitrate+nitrite (NO<sub>x</sub>) concentrations, wind speed, and water temperature explained a third of the variations in accumulated dissolved MCs, but no relationship was seen for DA concentrations based on monthly sampling within this highly dynamic system. This study emphasizes the importance of continued algal toxin monitoring in systems like Bogue Sound which might experience decreases in water quality similar to adjacent, nutrient-impaired regions within the PASS.",

The aberrant expression of circRNAs may result in various diseases. Herein, we demonstrate the construction of genetically encoded light-up RNA aptamers for ultrasensitive and label-free detection of circRNA mitochondrial tRNA translation optimization 1 (circMTO1) in cancer cells and tissues. The light-up RNA aptamers are generated by proximity ligation-activated recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA)-assisted transcription amplification. When circMTO1 is present, it initiates the proximity ligation reaction, activating RPA to produce numerous long double-stranded DNAs containing T7 promoters. Subsequently, the RPA products are identified by T7 RNA polymerase, initiating the transcription amplification reaction to generate abundant Spinach RNA aptamers. Spinach RNA aptamers can bind with DFHBI (3,5-difluoro-4-hydroxybenzylidene imidazolidinone) dye to produce a distinct fluorescence signal with near-zero background. This biosensor exhibits excellent selectivity and high sensitivity with a limit of detection of 2.54 aM. It can accurately monitor cellular circMTO1 at the single-cell level and discriminate the expression of circMTO1 between breast cancer patient tissues and healthy tissues. Notably, this biosensor can be employed to measure other nucleic acids by altering the corresponding target recognition sequences, providing a valuable platform for cancer diagnosis and biomedical study.",

Hit drugs were tested in a moderate contusion model in mice for cytokine regulation, and improved tissue preservation and locomotor recovery. <b>Results:</b> Three compounds robustly reduced <i>il-1β</i> expression in zebrafish. Cimetidine, an over-the-counter H2 receptor antagonist, also reduced the number of pro-inflammatory neutrophils and rescued recovery after injury in a zebrafish mutant with prolonged inflammation. Cimetidine action on <i>il-1β</i> expression levels was abolished by somatic mutation of H2 receptor <i>hrh2b</i>, suggesting specific action. In mice, systemic treatment with Cimetidine led to significantly improved recovery of locomotor behavior as compared to controls, accompanied by decreased neuronal tissue loss and a shift towards a pro-regenerative profile of cytokine gene expression. <b>Conclusion:</b> Our screen revealed H2 receptor signaling as a promising target for future therapeutic interventions in spinal cord injury.

The phenomenon of RNA interference (RNAi) inheritance in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is an effective model to investigate TEI that takes advantage of this model organism's short life cycle, self-propagation, and transparency. In RNAi inheritance, exposure of animals to RNAi leads to gene silencing and altered chromatin signatures at the target locus that persist for multiple generations in the absence of the initial trigger. This protocol describes the analysis of RNAi inheritance in C. elegans using a germline-expressed nuclear green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter. Reporter silencing is initiated by feeding the animals bacteria expressing double-stranded RNA targeting GFP. At each generation, animals are passaged to maintain synchronized development, and reporter gene silencing is determined by microscopy. At select generations, populations are collected and processed for chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) to measure histone modification enrichment at the GFP reporter locus.

        "abstract": "General anesthesia has long been used in clinical practice, but its precise pharmacological effects on neural circuits are not fully understood. Recent investigations suggest that the sleep-wake system may play a role in the reversible loss of consciousness induced by general anesthetics. Studies in mice have shown that microinjection of dopamine receptor 1 (D1R) agonists into the nucleus accumbens (NAc) promotes recovery from isoflurane anesthesia, while microinjection of D1R antagonists has the opposite effect. Furthermore, during the induction and maintenance of sevoflurane anesthesia, there is a significant decrease in extracellular dopamine levels in the NAc, which subsequently increases during the recovery period. These findings suggest the involvement of the NAc in the regulation of general anesthesia. However, the specific role of D1R-expressing neurons in the NAc during general anesthesia and the downstream effect pathways are still not well understood. In order to analyze the impact of sevoflurane anesthesia on NAc<sup>D1R</sup>  neurons and the NAc<sup>D1R</sup> -VP pathway, this study employed calcium fiber photometry to investigate alterations in the fluorescence intensity of calcium signals in dopamine D1-receptor-expressing neurons located in the nucleus accumbens (NAc<sup>D1R</sup>  neurons) and the NAc<sup>D1R</sup> -VP pathway during sevoflurane anesthesia. Subsequently, optogenetic techniques were utilized to activate or inhibit NAc<sup>D1R</sup>  neurons and their synaptic terminals in the ventral pallidum (VP), aiming to elucidate the role of NAc<sup>D1R</sup>  neurons and the NAc<sup>D1R</sup> -VP pathway in sevoflurane anesthesia. These experiments were supplemented with electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings and behavioral tests. Lastly, a genetically-encoded fluorescent sensor was employed to observe changes in extracellular GABA neurotransmitters in the VP during sevoflurane anesthesia. Our findings revealed that sevoflurane administration led to the inhibition of NAc<sup>D1R</sup> neuron population activity, as well as their connections within the ventral pallidum (VP). We also observed a reversible reduction in extracellular GABA levels in the VP during both the induction and emergence phases of sevoflurane anesthesia. Additionally, the optogenetic activation of NAc<sup>D1R</sup>  neurons and their synaptic terminals in the VP resulted in a promotion of wakefulness during sevoflurane anesthesia, accompanied by a decrease in EEG slow wave activity and burst suppression rate. Conversely, the optogenetic inhibition of the NAc<sup>D1R</sup> -VP pathway exerted opposite effects. The NAc<sup>D1R</sup> -VP pathway serves as a crucial downstream pathway of NAc<sup>D1R</sup> neurons, playing a significant role in regulating arousal during sevoflurane anesthesia. Importantly, this pathway appears to be associated with the release of GABA neurotransmitters from VP cells.",

        "abstract": "Sign-tracking (ST) rats show enhanced cue sensitivity before drug experience that predicts greater discrete cue-induced drug seeking compared with goal-tracking or intermediate rats. Cue-evoked dopamine in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) is a neurobiological signature of sign-tracking behaviors. Here, we examine a critical regulator of the dopamine system, endocannabinoids, which bind the cannabinoid receptor-1 (CB1R) in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) to control cue-evoked striatal dopamine levels. We use cell type-specific optogenetics, intra-VTA pharmacology, and fiber photometry to test the hypothesis that VTA CB1R receptor signaling regulates NAc dopamine levels to control sign tracking. We trained male and female rats in a Pavlovian lever autoshaping (PLA) task to determine their tracking groups before testing the effect of VTA → NAc dopamine inhibition. We found that this circuit is critical for mediating the vigor of the ST response. Upstream of this circuit, intra-VTA infusions of rimonabant, a CB1R inverse agonist, during PLA decrease lever and increase food cup approach in sign-trackers. Using fiber photometry to measure fluorescent signals from a dopamine sensor, GRAB<sub>DA</sub> (AAV9-hSyn-DA2m), we tested the effects of intra-VTA rimonabant on NAc dopamine dynamics during autoshaping in female rats. We found that intra-VTA rimonabant decreased sign-tracking behaviors, which was associated with increases in NAc shell, but not core, dopamine levels during reward delivery [unconditioned stimulus (US)]. Our results suggest that CB1R signaling in the VTA influences the balance between the conditioned stimulus-evoked and US-evoked dopamine responses in the NAc shell and biases behavioral responding to cues in sign-tracking rats.<b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Substance use disorder (SUD) is a chronically relapsing psychological disorder that affects a subset of individuals who engage in drug use. Recent research suggests that there are individual behavioral and neurobiological differences before drug experience that predict SUD and relapse vulnerabilities. Here, we investigate how midbrain endocannabinoids regulate a brain pathway that is exclusively involved in driving cue-motivated behaviors of sign-tracking rats. This work contributes to our mechanistic understanding of individual vulnerabilities to cue-triggered natural reward seeking that have relevance for drug-motivated behaviors.",

        "abstract": "Rac small GTPases play important roles during embryonic development of the inner ear; however, little is known regarding their function in cochlear hair cells (HCs) after specification. Here, we revealed the localization and activation of Racs in cochlear HCs using GFP-tagged Rac plasmids and transgenic mice expressing a Rac1-fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) biosensor. Furthermore, we employed Rac1-knockout (Rac1-KO, Atoh1-Cre;Rac1<sup>flox/flox</sup>) and Rac1 and Rac3 double KO (Rac1/Rac3-DKO, Atoh1-Cre;Rac1<sup>flox/flox</sup>;Rac3<sup>-/-</sup>) mice, under the control of the Atoh1 promoter. However, both Rac1-KO and Rac1/Rac3-DKO mice exhibited normal cochlear HC morphology at 13 weeks of age and normal hearing function at 24 weeks of age. No hearing vulnerability was observed in young adult (6-week-old) Rac1/Rac3-DKO mice even after intense noise exposure. Consistent with prior reports, the results from Atoh1-Cre;tdTomato mice confirmed that the Atoh1 promoter became functional only after embryonic day 14 when the sensory HC precursors exit the cell cycle. Taken together, these findings indicate that although Rac1 and Rac3 contribute to the early development of sensory epithelia in cochleae, as previously shown, they are dispensable for the maturation of cochlear HCs in the postmitotic state or for hearing maintenance following HC maturation. KEY MESSAGES: Mice with Rac1 and Rac3 deletion were generated after HC specification. Knockout mice exhibit normal cochlear hair cell morphology and hearing. Racs are dispensable for hair cells in the postmitotic state after specification. Racs are dispensable for hearing maintenance after HC maturation.",

        "abstract": "<i>Ganoderma</i> is a prize medicinal macrofungus with a broad range of pharmaceutical values. To date, various attempts have been made to cultivate <i>Ganoderma</i> to improve the production of secondary metabolites with pharmacological activity. Among the adopted techniques, protoplast preparation and regeneration are indispensable. However, the evaluation of protoplasts and regenerated cell walls usually relies on electron microscopy assays, which require time-consuming and destructive sample preparation and merely provide localized information in the selected area. In contrast, fluorescence assays enable sensitive real-time detection and imaging <i>in vivo</i>. They can also be applied to flow cytometry, providing a collective overview of every cell in a sample. However, for macrofungi such as <i>Ganoderma</i>, the fluorescence analysis of protoplasts and regenerated cell walls is difficult owing to the hindrance of the homologous fluorescent protein expression and the lack of an appropriate fluorescence marker. Herein, a specific plasma membrane probe, TAMRA perfluorocarbon nucleic acid probe (TPFN), is proposed for the nondestructive and quantitative fluorescence analysis of cell wall regeneration. Exploiting the perfluorocarbon membrane-anchoring chains, hydrophilic nucleic acid linker, and fluorescent dye TAMRA, the probe is proven to be selective, soluble, and stable, enabling rapid fluorescence detection of a protoplast sample free of transgenic expression or immune staining. Based on the TPFN and flow cytometry techniques, a quantitative approach is constructed to monitor the process of cell wall growth in a fast, quantitative, and high-throughout manner, and the obtained results are consistent with those of conventional electron microscopy. In principle, with slight modifications or integration, the proposed probe and approach can be adapted to the preparation of cell protoplasts, inspection of cell wall integrity under environmental stress, and programmable membrane engineering for cytobiology and physiology research.",

This insertion causes mis-splicing of intron 32 (TAF1-32i) and reduced TAF1 levels. TAF1-32i transcript is unique to XDP patient cells and can be detected in their extracellular vesicles (EVs). We engrafted patient and control iPSC-derived neural progenitor cells (hNPCs) into the striatum of mice. To track TAF1-32i transcript spread by EVs, we transduced the brain-implanted hNPCs with a lentiviral construct called ENoMi, which consists of a re-engineered tetraspanin scaffold tagged with bioluminescent and fluorescent reporter proteins under an EF-1α promoter. Alongside this improved detection in ENoMi-hNPCs-derived EVs, their surface allows specific immunocapture purification, thereby facilitating TAF1-32i analysis. Using this ENoMi-labeling method, TAF1-32i was demonstrated in EVs released from XDP hNPCs implanted in mouse brains. Post-implantation of ENoMi-XDP hNPCs, TAF1-32i transcript was retrieved in EVs isolated from mouse brain and blood, and levels increased over time in plasma. We compared and combined our EV isolation technique to analyze XDP-derived TAF1-32i with other techniques, including size exclusion chromatography and Exodisc. Overall, our study demonstrates the successful engraftment of XDP patient-derived hNPCs in mice as a tool for monitoring disease markers with EVs.",

The transcription factor (TF)-based biosensors are usually organized in modular architecture and function in a regulator-depended manner, whose performance properties can be fine-tuned by modifying the expression level of the TF. In this study, we modulated the performance characteristics, including sensitivity and operating range, of an MphR-based erythromycin biosensor by fine-adjusting regulator expression levels via ribosome-binding site (RBS) engineering and obtained a panel of biosensors with varied sensitivities by iterative fluorescence-assisted cell sorting (FACS) in <i>Escherichia coli</i> to accommodate different screening purposes. To exemplify their application potential, two engineered biosensors with 10-fold different sensitivities were employed in the precise high-throughput screening by microfluidic-based fluorescence-activated droplet sorting (FADS) of <i>Saccharopolyspora erythraea</i> mutant libraries with different starting erythromycin productions, and mutants representing as high as 6.8 folds and over 100% of production improvements were obtained starting from the wild-type strain and the high-producing industrial strain, respectively.

Not all hairy roots induced by A. rhizogenes are transgenic, however, which leads to requirement of a binary vector to carry a reporter gene to distinguish transgenic roots from non-transformed hairy roots. The beta-glucuronidase gene (GUS) and fluorescent protein gene often are used as reporter markers in the process of hairy root transformation, but they require expensive chemical reagents or imaging equipment. Alternatively, AtMYB75, an R2R3 MYB transcription factor from Arabidopsis thaliana, recently has been used as a reporter gene in hairy root transformation in some leguminous plants and can cause anthocyanin accumulation in transgenic hairy roots. Whether AtMYB75 can be used as a reporter gene in the hairy roots of tomato and if the anthocyanins accumulating in the roots will affect AMF colonization, however, are still unknown. In this study, the one-step cutting method was used for tomato hairy root transformation by A.rhizogenes. It is faster and has a higher transformation efficiency than the conventional method. AtMYB75 was used as a reporter gene in tomato hairy root transformation. The results showed that the overexpression of AtMYB75 caused anthocyanin accumulation in the transformed hairy roots. Anthocyanin accumulation in the transgenic hairy roots did not affect their colonization by the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus, Funneliformis mosseae strain BGC NM04A, and there was no difference in the expression of the AMF colonization marker gene SlPT4 in AtMYB75 transgenic roots and wild-type roots. Hence, AtMYB75 can be used as a reporter gene in tomato hairy root transformation and in the study of symbiosis between tomato and AMF.",

In particular, the effects of low water temperature associated with prolonged ice-cover periods on Se uptake by periphyton and further transfer to benthic macroinvertebrates (BMI) have been overlooked. Such information is crucial to help improve Se modelling and risk assessment at sites receiving continuous Se inputs. To date, this seems to be the first study to address these research questions. Here, we examined potential differences related to sampling methods (artificial substrates vs. grab samples) and seasons (summer vs. winter) on Se dynamics in the benthic food chain of a boreal lake (McClean Lake) receiving continuous low-level Se input from a Saskatchewan uranium milling operation. During summer 2019, water, sediment grab samples and artificial substrates were sampled from 8 sites with varying mill-treated effluent exposure. In winter 2021, water and sediment grab samples were sampled at 4 locations in McClean Lake. Water, sediment, and biological samples were subsequently analyzed for total Se concentrations. Enrichment functions (EF) in periphyton and trophic transfer factors (TTF) in BMI were calculated for both sampling methods and seasons. Periphyton collected with artificial substrates (Hester-Dendy samplers and glass plates) exhibited significantly higher mean Se concentrations (2.4 ± 1.5 μg/g d.w) than periphyton collected from the surface of sediment grab samples (1.1 ± 1.3 μg/g d.w). Selenium concentrations in periphyton sampled in winter (3.5 ± 1.0 μg/g d.w) were significantly greater than summer (1.1 ± 1.3 μg/g d.w). Nevertheless, Se bioaccumulation in BMI was similar between seasons, possibly suggesting that invertebrates are not actively feeding in winter. Further investigations are necessary to verify if peak Se bioaccumulation in BMI takes place in spring, coinciding with the reproductive and developmental windows of some fish species.",

In this protocol, we describe the use of a new series of transposons designed to obtain random fusions to either the <i>lacZY</i> operon or the gene for superfolder green fluorescent protein (sfGFP). Transposition is achieved through the activity of the hyperactive variant of Tn5 transposase (Tnp) whose gene is positioned in <i>cis</i> with respect to the transposable module and under the control of the anyhydrotetracycline (AHTc)-inducible P<sup>tet</sup> promoter. The transposable module comprises a promoter-less <i>lacZY</i> operon or the <i>sfGFP</i> gene, with or without the <i>lacZ</i> or <i>sfGFP</i> ribosome-binding site, plus a <i>kan</i> gene for selection. The transposon-transposase unit is harbored on an R6K-based suicide plasmid. The plasmid is introduced into recipient cells by electro-transformation and the synthesis of Tn5 Tnp is induced transiently by including AHTc in the recovery medium. Cells are then plated on kanamycin-supplemented medium (without AHTc) where the plasmid DNA is lost and only cells in which transposition has occurred can form colonies. Fusions are detected by screening for colony color on lactose indicator plates (<i>lacZ</i> transposition) or monitoring green fluorescence (<i>sfGFP</i> transposition). Depending on whether the reporter gene carries or lacks the ribosome binding sequence, the fusions obtained will either be transcriptional or translational. Parallel screening of colonies grown in the absence and presence of a drug (or condition) eliciting a global regulatory response allows identification of fusions specifically activated or repressed as part of such response.",

The stress-responsive whole-cell biosensor is a powerful tool to evaluate direct or indirect damages of biological macromolecules induced by toxic chemicals. In this proof-of-concept study, nine well-characterized stress-responsive promoters were first selected to assemble a set of blue indigoidine-based biosensors. The PuspA-based, PfabA-based, and PgrpE-based biosensors were eliminated due to their high background. A dose-dependent increase of visible blue signal was observed in PrecA-, PkatG-, and PuvrA-based biosensors, responsive to potent mutagens, including mitomycin and nalidixic acid, but not to genotoxic lead and cadmium. The PrecA, PkatG, and Ppgi gene promoters were further fused to a purple deoxyviolacein synthetic enzyme cluster. Although high basal production of deoxyviolacein is unavoidable, an enhanced visible purple signal in response to mitomycin and nalidixic acid was observed as dose-dependent, especially in PkatG-based biosensors. The study shows that a set of stress-responsive biosensors employing visible pigment as a reporter is pre-validating in detecting extensive DNA damage and intense oxidative stress. Unlike widely-used fluorescent and bioluminescent biosensors, the visual pigment-based biosensor can become a novel, low-cost, mini-equipment, and high-throughput colorimetric device for the toxicity assessment of chemicals.

We further studied the structure and sensing mechanism of pnRFP using X-ray crystallography, <sup>11</sup>B-NMR, and computational methods. The boron atom in pnRFP adopts an sp<sup>2</sup>-hybridization geometry in a hydrophobic pocket, and the reaction of pnRFP with peroxynitrite generates a product with a twisted chromophore, corroborating the observed \"turn-off\" fluorescence response.

The main reason for the impact load is that there is a speed difference between the end of the manipulator and the target when the manipulator grabs the target. In this method, the mathematical model of seven-segment manipulator trajectory planning is constructed first. The mathematical model of synchronous tracking of dynamic targets based on a time-minimum manipulator is constructed by taking the robot's acceleration, speed, and synchronization as constraints. The model transforms the multi-constraint-solving problem into a single-objective-solving problem. Finally, the particle swarm optimization algorithm is used to solve the model. The calculation results are put into the trajectory planning model of the manipulator to obtain the synchronous tracking trajectory of the manipulator. Simulation and experiments show that each joint of the robot's arm can synchronously track dynamic targets within the constraint range. This method can ensure the synchronization of the position, speed, and acceleration of the moving target and the target after tracking. The average position error is 2.1 mm, and the average speed error is 7.4 mm/s. The robot has a high tracking accuracy, which further improves the robot's grasping stability and success rate.",

        "abstract": "Magnetic cell sorting technology stands out because of its speed, simplicity, and ability to process large cell numbers. However, it also suffers from a number of drawbacks, in particular low discrimination power, which results in all-or-none selection outcomes limited to a bulk separation of cell populations into positive and negative fractions, as well as the modest purity of the selected cells and the inability to select subpopulations of cells with high expression of a surface marker. In the present study, we developed a simple solution to this problem and confirmed the effectiveness of this approach by multiple experiments with the magnetic selection of transduced cell populations. Murine NIH 3T3 cells were transduced with the bicistronic retroviral vector constructs co-expressing fluorescent reporter proteins EGFP (enhanced green fluorescent protein) or DsRed-Express 2 and LNGFR (low-affinity nerve growth factor receptor) as surface selection markers. The effects of the magnetic selection of transduced cells with anti-LNGFR Micro Bead (MB) doses ranging from 0.5 to 80 µL have been assessed. Low doses of MBs favored the depletion of weakly positive cells from the population, resulting in the higher expression levels of EGFP or DsRed-Express2 reporters in the selected cell fractions. Low MB doses also contributed to the increased purity of the selected population, even for samples with a low initial percentage of positive cells. At the same time, high MB doses resulted in the increased yield and a more faithful representation of the original expression profiles following selection. We further demonstrate that for populations with fairly narrow distribution of expression levels, it is possible to achieve separation into high- and low-expressing subsets using the two-stage selection scheme based on the sequential use of low and high doses of MBs. For populations with broad expression distribution, a one-stage selection with low or high doses of MBs is sufficient for a clear separation of low- and high-expressing subsets in the column-retained and flow-through fractions, respectively. This study substantially extends the potential of magnetic cell sorting, and may open new possibilities in a number of biomedical applications.",

        "abstract": "Budding yeast uses the TORC1-Sch9p and cAMP-PKA signalling pathways to regulate adaptations to changing nutrient environments. Dynamic and single-cell measurements of the activity of these cascades will improve our understanding of the cellular adaptation of yeast. Here, we employed the AKAR3-EV biosensor developed for mammalian cells to measure the cellular phosphorylation status determined by Sch9p and PKA activity in budding yeast. Using various mutant strains and inhibitors, we show that AKAR3-EV measures the Sch9p- and PKA-dependent phosphorylation status in intact yeast cells. At the single-cell level, we found that the phosphorylation responses are homogenous for glucose, sucrose, and fructose, but heterogeneous for mannose. Cells that start to grow after a transition to mannose correspond to higher normalized Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) levels, in line with the involvement of Sch9p and PKA pathways to stimulate growth-related processes. The Sch9p and PKA pathways have a relatively high affinity for glucose (K0.5 of 0.24 mM) under glucose-derepressed conditions. Lastly, steady-state FRET levels of AKAR3-EV seem to be independent of growth rates, suggesting that Sch9p- and PKA-dependent phosphorylation activities are transient responses to nutrient transitions. We believe that the AKAR3-EV sensor is an excellent addition to the biosensor arsenal for illuminating cellular adaptation in single yeast cells.",

These exchanges take place through microscopic valves, called stomata, on the leaf surface. The opening of the stomata is regulated by two guard cells that actively and reversibly modify their turgor pressure to modulate the opening of the stomatal pores. Stomatal function depends on the regulation of the ion transport capacities of cell membranes as well as on the modification of the subcellular organisation of guard cells. Here we report how the vacuolar and cytosolic compartments of guard cells quantitatively participate in stomatal opening. We used a genetically encoded biosensor to visualise changes in ionic concentration during stomatal opening. The 3D reconstruction of living guard cells shows that the vacuole is the responsible for the change in guard cell volume required for stomatal opening.",

Although there have been significant advancements in haptics and robotics, the kinematic strategies involved in bimanual coupled tasks are still not fully understood. This study aimed to investigate the dynamic interaction between hands during the manipulation of a shared object using two impedance-controlled exoskeletons programmed to simulate bimanual coupled manipulation of virtual objects. Twenty-six participants (right-handed and left-handed) were asked to use both hands to grab and place simulated objects in specific locations. The virtual objects were rendered with four different dynamic properties, affecting the manipulation strategies used to complete the tasks. The results showed that force asymmetries were related to movement direction and handedness preference, with right-handers exhibiting asymmetries related to movement direction and left-handers showing better control of the force applied between their hands. This is possibly due to their constant exposure to objects designed for right-handed use. Additionally, the haptic properties of the virtual objects influenced task performance in terms of timing and failure for all participants. This study demonstrates the potential of advanced technologies to provide realistic simulations of multi-joint movements involving the entire upper extremities. The findings have implications for the development of training programs for bimanual object manipulation tasks and the design of virtual environments that can enhance the learning process.",

Subcellular AMPK activity results in regulation of glycolysis, lipid and protein biosynthesis, mitochondrial function, and gene expression. But how AMPK senses and responds to stimuli in a compartment-specific manner is not well understood, leaving an incomplete picture of compartmentalized AMPK activity. Key tools for studying subcellular AMPK activity are genetically encoded AMPK activity reporters (AMPKARs), which allow for the quantitative visualization of subcelluar AMPK activity. However, many AMPKARs suffer from poor dynamic range and sensitivity, limiting their application. I recently reported the development of a new excitation-ratiometric (ExRai) AMPKAR, a single-fluorophore AMPKAR with enhanced dynamic range for detection of subtle, subcellular AMPK activity. I used ExRai AMPKAR to study subcellular AMPK activity at several locations, including the lysosome and mitochondria, identifying new mechanisms for the regulation of AMPK activity. Here, I describe the use of ExRai AMPKAR to image subcellular AMPK activity in mouse embryonic fibroblasts using both widefield and confocal microscopy.

Control of ZYMV by cross-protection has been practised for decades, but selecting useful mild viruses is time-consuming and laborious. Most attenuated potyviruses used for cross-protection do not induce hypersensitive reaction (HR) in Chenopodium quinoa, a local lesion host Chenopodium quinoa. Here, severe ZYMV TW-TN3 tagged with green fluorescent protein (GFP), designated ZG, was used for nitrous acid mutagenesis. From three trials, 11 mutants were identified from fluorescent spots without HR in inoculated C. quinoa leaves. Five mutants caused attenuated symptoms in squash plants. The genomic sequences of these five mutants revealed that most of the nonsynonymous changes were located in the HC-Pro gene. The replacement of individual mutated HC-Pros in the ZG backbone and an RNA silencing suppression (RSS) assay indicated that each mutated HC-Pro is defective in RSS function and responsible for reduced virulence. Four mutants provided high degrees of protection (84%-100%) against severe virus TW-TN3 in zucchini squash plants, with ZG 4-10 being selected for removal of the GFP tag. After removal of the GFP gene, Z 4-10 induced symptoms similar to ZG 4-10 and still provided 100% protection against TW-TN3 in squash, thus is considered not a genetically engineered mutant. Therefore, using a GFP reporter to select non-HR mutants of ZYMV from C. quinoa leaves is an efficient way to obtain beneficial mild viruses for cross-protection.

The discovery and targeted creation of new antibiotics are today among the most important public health issues.

A distinct advantage of most AMPs is their direct mechanism of action that is mediated by their membranolytic properties. The low rate of emergence of antibiotic resistance associated with the killing mechanism of action of AMPs attracts heightened attention to this field. Recombinant technologies enable the creation of genetically programmable AMP producers for large-scale generation of recombinant AMPs (rAMPs) or the creation of rAMP-producing biocontrol agents. The methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris was genetically modified for the secreted production of rAMP. Constitutive expression of the sequence encoding the mature AMP protegrin-1 provided the yeast strain that effectively inhibits the growth of target gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. An antimicrobial effect was also observed in the microculture when a yeast rAMP producer and a reporter bacterium were co-encapsulated in droplets of microfluidic double emulsion.

Ratiometric measurements provide built-in self-calibration for signal correction, enabling more sensitive and reliable detection. Herein, we structurally modulate green fluorescent protein (GFP)-like chromophores by integrating the imidazolidinone scaffold of the GFP chromophore and coumarin 6H, obtaining a G4 responsive dual-emission chromophore, called NHCouI. The red emission signal of NHCouI can specifically respond to parallel G4s, while its green emission signal is inert and acts as an internal reference signal. NHCouI-G4 complexes feature high fluorescence quantum yield and excellent anti-photobleaching properties. NHCouI can self-calibrate the signal and avoid viscosity disturbances within the range of major subcellular organelles during G4 imaging in living cells. It is also applied to reflect the difference between apoptosis and ferroptosis <i>via</i> tracking G4s.

Here, we examine the contribution of Wnt/planar cell polarity (Wnt/PCP), one of the non-canonical Wnt signaling pathways and defined by the involvement of the tetraspanin-like proteins Vangl1 and Vangl2, to breast tumor cell motility, collective cell invasiveness and mammary tumor metastasis. Vangl1 and Vangl2 knockdown and overexpression and Wnt5a stimulation were employed to manipulate Wnt/PCP signaling in a battery of breast cancer cell lines representing all breast cancer subtypes, and in tumor organoids from MMTV-PyMT mice. Cell migration was assessed by scratch and organoid invasion assays, Vangl protein subcellular localization was assessed by confocal fluorescence microscopy, and RhoA activation was assessed in real time by fluorescence imaging with an advanced FRET biosensor. The impact of Wnt/PCP suppression on mammary tumor growth and metastasis was assessed by determining the effect of conditional Vangl2 knockout on the MMTV-NDL mouse mammary tumor model. We observed that Vangl2 knockdown suppresses the motility of all breast cancer cell lines examined, and overexpression drives the invasiveness of collectively migrating MMTV-PyMT organoids. Vangl2-dependent RhoA activity is localized in real time to a subpopulation of motile leader cells displaying a hyper-protrusive leading edge, Vangl protein is localized to leader cell protrusions within leader cells, and actin cytoskeletal regulator RhoA is preferentially activated in the leader cells of a migrating collective. Mammary gland-specific knockout of Vangl2 results in a striking decrease in lung metastases in MMTV-NDL mice, but does not impact primary tumor growth characteristics. We conclude that Vangl-dependent Wnt/PCP signaling promotes breast cancer collective cell migration independent of breast tumor subtype and facilitates distant metastasis in a genetically engineered mouse model of breast cancer. Our observations are consistent with a model whereby Vangl proteins localized at the leading edge of leader cells in a migrating collective act through RhoA to mediate the cytoskeletal rearrangements required for pro-migratory protrusion formation.",

This should be considered when restoring partially edentulous patients with a metal-free fixed partial denture (FPD). An alternative abutment preparation design can be used in order to increase the materials' volume in the most fracture-prone \"connector area\" of an FPD. The increased size of the connection might positively influence the constructions' mechanical durability, thereby increasing its success and survivability. The aim of the present study was to investigate the influence of two preparation designs of the distal abutment on the fracture resistance of three-unit, monolithic, ZrO2 FPDs. 3D printed replicas of a partially edentulous mandibular segment and a ZrO2, milled in full-contour, three-unit FPDs were used for this investigation. Two experimental groups (n=10 ) were defined based on the preparation design of the distal abutment tooth - classical shoulder preparation 0.8 mm deep, and endocrown preparation with a 2-mm retention cavity. The bridge - mandibular segment replica assembly was done with relyXU200(3M ESPE, USA), light-cured for 10 seconds per side with D-light Duo (GC, Europe). After cementation the test specimens were subjected to loading in a universal testing machine Zwick (Zwick-Roell Group, Germany). Statistical analysis was performed using R and includes descriptive statistics, t-test for quantitative and chi-squared test for qualitative variables. The results showed no difference between the two studied groups in the maximum force required to fracture the test specimens [t=-1.8088 (17.39), p-value=0.087; P>0.05]. 95% of the fracture lines were located in the distal connector. Within the limitations of this study, it can be concluded that both tested preparation designs show similar results in terms of the load required to fracture the test specimens. Furthermore, it is confirmed that the distal connector is the weakest area of an all-ceramic 3-unit FPD in the posterior area.",

It is not yet well understood how pricing can be used to encourage healthier substitute purchases. The aim of the study was to assess the effect of a retailer-led relative pricing intervention on weekly purchases of targeted snack foods and beverages. This was an ecological analysis in a real-world large tertiary hospital consumer food environment setting in urban Canada, comprised of four retail outlets: two large cafeterias, one smaller cafeteria, and one grab-and-go café. An interrupted time series analysis was designed to evaluate the effect of Snacking Made Simple, a retailer-led relative pricing intervention applied to 10 popular snack foods and beverages (n = 87 weeks, 66 weeks baseline and 21 weeks intervention, April 2018 to December 2019), on weekly purchase differences between healthier and less healthy targeted items, adjusted for weekly sales volume. Five healthier items were price discounted, alongside a price increase for five less healthy items. The intervention was actively merchandised in keeping with behaviour change theory. Weekly purchases of targeted snacks became healthier during the intervention period (β = 21.41, p = 0.0024). This followed a baseline period during which weekly purchases of less healthy targeted snacks had outpaced over time those of healthier targeted snacks (β = -11.02, p = 3.68E-14). We estimated that, all else being equal, a hypothetical 9.43 additional weeks of the intervention would be required to transition to net-healthier targeted snack purchases in this environment. The effects of the intervention varied by retail outlet, and the outcome appears driven by specific food items; further, examining merchandising implementation, we posited whether direct versus indirect substitution may have affected purchasing outcomes. Relative pricing may be a promising way to incentivize healthier substitute purchasing in the consumer food environment. Added attention to merchandising strategy as well as value-add factors within food categories and their effects on price salience may be an important factor in effective intervention design.",

However, the framework of molecular mechanisms contributing to manganism is still unclear. Using an in vitro neuroinflammation model based on the insulated signaling pathway reporter transposon constructs stably transfected into a murine BV-2 microglia line, we tested effects of manganese (II) together with a set of 12 metal salts on the transcriptional activities of the NF-κB, activator protein-1 (AP-1), signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1), STAT1/STAT2, STAT3, Nrf2, and metal-responsive transcription factor-1 (MTF-1) via luciferase assay, while concatenated destabilized green fluorescent protein expression provided for simultaneous evaluation of cellular viability. This experiment revealed specific and strong responses to manganese (II) in reporters of the type I and type II interferon-induced signaling pathways, while weaker activation of the NF-κB in the microglia was detected upon treatment of cells with Mn(II) and Ba(II). There was a similarity between Mn(II) and interferon-γ in the temporal STAT1 activation profile and in their antagonism to bacterial LPS. Sixty-four natural and synthetic flavonoids differentially affected both cytotoxicity and the pro-inflammatory activity of Mn (II) in the microglia. Whereas flavan-3-ols, flavanones, flavones, and flavonols were cytoprotective, isoflavones enhanced the cytotoxicity of Mn(II). Furthermore, about half of the tested flavonoids at 10-50 μM could attenuate both basal and 100-200 μM Mn(II)-induced activity at the gamma-interferon activated DNA sequence (GAS) in the cells, suggesting no critical roles for the metal chelation or antioxidant activity in the protective potential of flavonoids against manganese in microglia. In summary, results of the study identified Mn as a specific elicitor of the interferon-dependent pathways that can be mitigated by dietary polyphenols.",

In contrast, protein-based fluorescent or bioluminescent EV reporters have more accurately revealed their distribution in cells and mouse models. Here, we describe a red-shifted bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) EV reporter, PalmReNL, to analyze the trafficking of small EVs (<200 nm; sEVs) and medium/large EVs (>200 nm; m/lEVs) in mice. Its advantages are that (i) background signals in bioluminescence imaging (BLI) are negligible and (ii) the photons PalmReNL emits have spectral wavelengths longer than 600 nm and can more efficiently penetrate tissues than reporters emitting shorter wavelength light.",

        "abstract": "Pichia pastoris (Komagataella phaffii) is widely used for industrial production of heterologous proteins due to high secretory capabilities but selection of highly productive engineered strains remains a limiting step. Despite availability of a comprehensive molecular toolbox for construct design and gene integration, there is high clonal variability among transformants due to frequent multi-copy and off-target random integration. Therefore, functional screening of several hundreds of transformant clones is essential to identify the best protein production strains. Screening methods are commonly based on deep-well plate cultures with analysis by immunoblotting or enzyme activity assays of post-induction samples, and each heterologous protein produced may require development of bespoke assays with multiple sample processing steps. In this work, we developed a generic system based on a P. pastoris strain that uses a protein-based biosensor to identify highly productive protein secretion clones from a heterogeneous set of transformants. The biosensor uses a split green fluorescent protein where the large GFP fragment (GFP1-10) is fused to a sequence-specific protease from Tobacco Etch Virus (TEV) and is targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum. Recombinant proteins targeted for secretion are tagged with the small fragment of the split GFP (GFP11). Recombinant protein production can be measured by monitoring GFP fluorescence, which is dependent on interaction between the large and small GFP fragments. The reconstituted GFP is cleaved from the target protein by TEV protease, allowing for secretion of the untagged protein of interest and intracellular retention of the mature GFP. We demonstrate this technology with four recombinant proteins (phytase, laccase, β-casein and β-lactoglobulin) and show that the biosensor directly reports protein production levels that correlate with traditional assays. Our results confirm that the split GFP biosensor can be used for facile, generic, and rapid screening of P. pastoris clones to identify those with the highest production levels.",

Strong benthic enrichment (>1000 ind. m<sup>-2</sup>, >20 spp. sample<sup>-1</sup>) was also linked with higher fine sand fractions (>20%) near the jackets. Moreover, nearby sediments showed higher occurrences of coastal species and habitat diversification was promoted by Mytilus edulis shell debris and alive organisms (\"biofouling drop-offs\").

We also detected the cell developing capability of pl-HAMs. The crosslinked pl-HAMs appeared to be completely spherical-shaped particles and had good biocompatibility. L-929 cells and GMSCs grew around the pl-HAMs and increased gradually. Cell migration experiments showed that pl-HAMs combined with GMSCs could promote the migration of vascular endothelial cells significantly. Meanwhile, the green fluorescent protein-GMSCs in the pl-HAM group still remain in the soft tissue regeneration area 2 weeks after surgery. The results of in vivo studies showed that denser collagen deposition and more angiogenesis-related indicator CD31 expression in the pl-HAMs+ GMSCs + GeL group compared with the pl-HAMs + GeL group. Immunofluorescence showed that CD44, CD90, CD73 co-staining positive cells surrounded the microspheres in both pl-HAMs + GeL group and pl-HAM + GMSCs + GeL group.

Such particles also contaminate surfaces, creating a potential surface-transmission pathway. A fast acoustic biosensor with an antifouling nano-coating was introduced to detect severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on exposed surfaces in the Prague Public Transport System. Samples were measured directly without pre-treatment. Results with the sensor gave excellent agreement with parallel quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) measurements on 482 surface samples taken from actively used trams, buses, metro trains and platforms between 7 and 9 April 2021, in the middle of the lineage Alpha SARS-CoV-2 epidemic wave when 1 in 240 people were COVID-19 positive in Prague. Only ten of the 482 surface swabs produced positive results and none of them contained virus particles capable of replication, indicating that positive samples contained inactive virus particles and/or fragments. Measurements of the rate of decay of SARS-CoV-2 on frequently touched surface materials showed that the virus did not remain viable longer than 1-4 h. The rate of inactivation was the fastest on rubber handrails in metro escalators and the slowest on hard-plastic seats, window glasses and stainless-steel grab rails. As a result of this study, Prague Public Transport Systems revised their cleaning protocols and the lengths of parking times during the pandemic. Our findings suggest that surface transmission played no or negligible role in spreading SARS-CoV-2 in Prague. The results also demonstrate the potential of the new biosensor to serve as a complementary screening tool in epidemic monitoring and prognosis.",

        "abstract": "Restoring function in chronic stages of spinal cord injury (SCI) has often been met with failure or reduced efficacy when regenerative strategies are delayed past the acute or sub-acute stages of injury. Restoring function in the chronically injured spinal cord remains a critical challenge. We found that a single injection of retrogradely transported adeno-associated viruses (AAVrg) to knockout the phosphatase and tensin homolog protein (PTEN) in chronic SCI can effectively target both damaged and spared axons and restore locomotor functions in near-complete injury models. AAVrg's were injected to deliver cre recombinase and/or a red fluorescent protein (RFP) under the human Synapsin 1 promoter (hSyn1) into the spinal cords of C57BL/6 PTEN <sup>FloxΔ</sup> / <sup>Δ</sup> mice to knockout PTEN (PTEN-KO) in a severe thoracic SCI crush model at both acute and chronic time points. PTEN-KO improved locomotor abilities in both acute and chronic SCI conditions over a 9-week period. Regardless of whether treatment was initiated at the time of injury (acute), or three months after SCI (chronic), mice with limited hindlimb joint movement gained hindlimb weight support after treatment. Interestingly, functional improvements were not sustained beyond 9 weeks coincident with a loss of RFP reporter-gene expression and a near-complete loss of treatment-associated functional recovery by 6 months post-treatment. Treatment effects were also specific to severely injured mice; animals with weight support at the time of treatment lost function over a 6-month period. Retrograde tracing with Fluorogold revealed viable neurons throughout the motor cortex despite a loss of RFP expression at 9 weeks post-PTEN-KO. However, few Fluorogold labeled neurons were detected within the motor cortex at 6 months post-treatment. BDA labeling from the motor cortex revealed a dense corticospinal tract (CST) bundle in all groups except chronically treated PTEN-KO mice indicating a potential long-term toxic effect of PTEN-KO to neurons in the motor cortex. PTEN-KO mice had significantly more β <b>-</b> tubulin III labeled axons within the lesion when treatment was delivered acutely, but not chronically post-SCI. In conclusion, we have found that using AAVrg's to knockout PTEN is an effective manipulation capable of restoring motor functions in chronic SCI and can enhance axon growth of currently unidentified axon populations when delivered acutely after injury. However, the long-term consequences of PTEN-KO may exert neurotoxic effects.",

The molecular structure of BMs is a fine meshwork that incorporates specialized extracellular matrix proteins. Recently, live visualization of BMs in invertebrates demonstrated that their structure is flexible and dynamically rearranged during cell differentiation and organogenesis. However, the BM dynamics in mammalian tissues remain to be elucidated. We developed a mammalian BM imaging probe based on nidogen-1, a major BM-specific protein. Recombinant human nidogen-1 fused with an enhanced green fluorescent protein (Nid1-EGFP) retains its ability to bind to other BM proteins, such as laminin, type IV collagen, and perlecan, in a solid-phase binding assay. When added to the culture medium of embryoid bodies derived from mouse ES cells, recombinant Nid1-EGFP accumulated in the BM zone of embryoid bodies, and BMs were visualized <i>in vitro</i>. For <i>in vivo</i> BM imaging, a knock-in reporter mouse line expressing human nidogen-1 fused to the red fluorescent protein mCherry (R26-CAG-Nid1-mCherry) was generated. R26-CAG-Nid1-mCherry showed fluorescently labeled BMs in early embryos and adult tissues, such as the epidermis, intestine, and skeletal muscles, whereas BM fluorescence was unclear in several other tissues, such as the lung and heart. In the retina, Nid1-mCherry fluorescence visualized the BMs of vascular endothelium and pericytes. In the developing retina, Nid1-mCherry fluorescence labeled the BM of the major central vessels; however, the BM fluorescence were hardly observed in the peripheral growing tips of the vascular network, despite the presence of endothelial BM. Time-lapse observation of the retinal vascular BM after photobleaching revealed gradual recovery of Nid1-mCherry fluorescence, suggesting the turnover of BM components in developing retinal blood vessels. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of <i>in vivo</i> BM imaging using a genetically engineered mammalian model. Although R26-CAG-Nid1-mCherry has some limitations as an <i>in vivo</i> BM imaging model, it has potential applications in the study of BM dynamics during mammalian embryogenesis, tissue regeneration, and pathogenesis.",

For instance, species abundance indices can be calculated using data obtained from high-definition underwater cameras that enable to identify taxa at low taxonomical level. In biodiversity studies, environmental DNA (eDNA) has proven to be a useful tool for characterising fish species richness. However, several marine phyla remain poorly represented in reference gene databases or release limited amounts of DNA, restricting their detection. The absence of amplification of some invertebrate taxa might also reflect primer bias. We here explore and compare the performance of eDNA and image data in describing the marine communities of several sites in the Bay of Biscay. This was achieved by deploying a remotely operated vehicle to both record images and collect seawater samples. A total of 88 taxa were identified from the eDNA samples and 121 taxa from the images. For both methods, the best characterised phylum was Chordata, with 29 and 27 Actinopterygii species detected using image versus eDNA, respectively. Neither Bryozoa nor Cnidaria was detected in the eDNA samples while the phyla were easily identifiable by imagery. Similarly, Asteroidea (Echinodermata) and Cephalopoda (Mollusca) were scarcely detected in the eDNA samples but present on the images, while Annelida were mostly identified by eDNA (18 taxa vs 7 taxa from imagery). The complementary community descriptions we highlight from these two methods therefore advocate for using both eDNA and imagery in tandem in order to capture the macroscopic biodiversity of bentho-demersal marine communities.",

Boehm et al. suggested that c-di-GMP-activated YcgR directly interacted with the motor protein MotA to curb flagellar motor output. Paul et al. proposed that YcgR disrupted the organization of the FliG C-terminal domain to bias the flagellar rotation. The target proteins are controversial, and the role of motor proteins remains unclear in flagellar rotation speed and direction regulation by YcgR. Here we assayed the motor proteins' affinity via a modified FRET biosensor and accessed the role of those key residue via bead assays. We found that YcgR could interact with both MotA and FliG, and the affinities could be enhanced upon c-di-GMP binding. Furthermore, residue D54 of YcgR-N was needed for FliG binding. The mutation of the FliG binding residue D54 or the MotA binding ones, F117 and E232, restored flagellar rotation speed in wild-type cells and cells lacking chemotaxis response regulator CheY that switched the flagellar rotation direction and decreased the CCW ratio in wild-type cells. We propose that c-di-GMP-activated YcgR regulated the flagellar rotation speed and direction via its interaction with motor proteins MotA and FliG. Our work suggest the role of YcgR-motor proteins interaction in bacterial swimming regulation.",

LUNAS is easily integrated with recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA), providing attomolar sensitivity in a rapid one-pot assay. A calibrator luciferase is included for a robust ratiometric readout, enabling real-time monitoring of the RPA reaction using a simple digital camera. We designed an RT-RPA-LUNAS assay that allows SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection without the need for cumbersome RNA isolation and demonstrated its diagnostic performance for COVID-19 patient nasopharyngeal swab samples. Detection of SARS-CoV-2 from samples with viral RNA loads of ∼200 cp/μL was achieved within ∼20 min, showing that RPA-LUNAS is attractive for point-of-care infectious disease testing.",

However, the requirement of an excitation source largely hinders their applicability in point-of-care detection, as well as causing autofluorescence interference in complex samples. Herein, based on bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET), we developed a reaction-based ratiometric bioluminescent platform, which allows the excitation-free detection of analytes. The platform has a modular design consisting of a NanoLuc-HaloTag fusion as an energy donor, to which a synthetic fluorescent probe is bioorthogonally labeled as recognition moiety and energy acceptor. Once activated by the target, the fluorescent probe can be excited by NanoLuc to generate a remarkable BRET signal, resulting in obvious color changes of luminescence, which can be easily recorded and quantitatively analyzed by a smartphone. As a proof of concept, a fluorescent probe for HOCl was synthesized to construct the bioluminescent system. Results demonstrated the system showed a constant blue/red emission ratio which is independent to the signal intensity, allowing the quantification of HOCl concentration with high sensitivity (limit of detection (LOD) = 13 nM) and accuracy. Given the universality, this reaction-based bioluminescent platform holds great potential for point-of-care and quantitative detection of reactive species.",

The SFG pathogens are characterized by their ability to infect and rapidly proliferate inside host vascular endothelial cells that eventually result in impairment of vascular endothelium barrier functions. Benidipine, a wide range dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker, is used to prevent and treat cardiovascular diseases. In this study, we tested whether benidipine has protective effects against rickettsia-induced microvascular endothelial cell barrier dysfunction in vitro. We utilized an in vitro vascular model consisting of transformed human brain microvascular endothelial cells (tHBMECs) and continuously monitored transendothelial electric resistance (TEER) across the cell monolayer. We found that during the late stages of infection when we observed TEER decrease and when there was a gradual increase of the cytoplasmic [Ca<sup>2+</sup>], benidipine prevented these rickettsia-induced effects. In contrast, nifedipine, another cardiovascular dihydropyridine channel blocker specific for L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, did not prevent R. parkeri-induced drop of TEER. Additionally, neither drug was bactericidal. These data suggest that growth of R. parkeri inside endothelial cells is associated with impairment of endothelial cell monolayer integrity due to Ca<sup>2+</sup> flooding through specific, benidipine-sensitive T- or N/Q-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels but not through nifedipine-sensitive L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels. Further study will be required to discern the exact nature of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels and Ca<sup>2</sup>+ transporting system(s) involved, any contributions of the pathogen toward this process, as well as the suitability of benidipine and new dihydropyridine derivatives as complimentary therapeutic drugs against Rickettsia-induced vascular failure.",

A reliable strategy must be applied during o-DGT lab adaptation to avoid issues related to the analysis (i.e., presence of matrix effects in grab or passive samples) but also to the o-DGT configuration (i.e., undesirable sorption or desorption, lack of performance with insufficient elution or unreliable diffusion coefficient). To avoid analytical issues due to the presence of salts in grab samples, CaCl<sub>2</sub> exposure solutions must be used on a lab-scale development to monitor the hormone concentration. The selected o-DGT was composed of an Oasis® HLB binding gel and a diffusive gel in agarose because they provided better performance than polyacrylamide gels (i.e., higher elution factors and more repeatable diffusion coefficients). The elution factors of the binding gel were then from 0.79 ± 0.13 to 1.04 ± 0.13 (RSD < 15%) and the diffusion coefficients at 25 °C were from 4.07 ± 0.24 to 5.49 ± 0.28 × 10<sup>-6</sup> cm<sup>2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> (RSD < 9%). A laboratory exposure to a synthetic solution was performed to check the consistency with the DGT quantification model validating the calibration parameters for all hormones (except 17α-ethinylestradiol with a bias of 40%).

Finding other symptoms and signs could prove valuable for this hard-to-recognized disease. This protocol is part of the University of Nebraska Medical Center Orthostatic Tremor longitudinal study. It was noted that OT patients flex their toes and sometimes the foot arch while standing (Plantar Grasp). They reported doing this to \"grab\" the floor and improve stability. This paper analyses the diagnostic test characteristics of the patient-self-reported Plantar Grasp, a new sign in OT. There were 34 OT patients (88% females), and 20 controls (65% females). Eighty-eight percent of patients with OT reported the plantar grasp sign and none of the controls. The Plantar Grasp Sign was found to be very sensitive (88%), and extremely specific (100%) in our cohort. Non-weighted Negative Likelihood Ratio (NLR) was 0.12. And the 3% prevalence-weighted NLR was so low that the negative post-test probability was close to zero. Due to its high sensitivity, specificity, and ideal likelihood ratio, we propose that the Plantar Grasp sign could be considered to screen patients with possible OT. Further studies are needed to determine the specificity of this sign in OT versus other balance disorders.",

Each of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and ionomycin (IOM) stimulation weakly but their combined stimulation strongly enhanced EGFP expression. The stimulation-induced EGFP upregulation was also observed following T cell subset differentiation in a different manner. The EGFP induction by PMA + IOM stimulation was more potent than that by CD3/CD28 stimulation in helper T (Th)1, Th2, Th9, and regulatory T cells, while both stimulation conditions displayed the equivalent EGFP induction in Th17 cells.

Using immunofluorescence approaches, we investigated whether cremaster MNs also exhibit features reflecting their potential for electrical synaptic communication and examined some of their other synaptic characteristics. Both mice and rats displayed punctate immunolabelling of Cx36 associated with cremaster MNs, indicative of gap junction formation. Transgenic mice with enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) reporter for connexin36 expression showed that subpopulations of cremaster MNs in both male and female mice express eGFP, with greater proportions of those in male mice. The eGFP<sup>+</sup> MNs within the cremaster nucleus vs. eGFP<sup>-</sup> MNs inside and outside this nucleus displayed a 5-fold greater density of serotonergic innervation and exhibited a paucity of innervation by C-terminals arising from cholinergic V0c interneurons. All MNs within the cremaster motor nucleus displayed prominent patches of immunolabelling for SK3 (K<sup>+</sup>) channels around their periphery, suggestive of their identity as slow MNs, many though not all of which were in apposition to C-terminals. The results provide evidence for electrical coupling of a large proportion of cremaster MNs and suggest the existence of two populations of these MNs with possibly differential innervation of their peripheral target muscles serving different functions.",

Hydrogels are commonly fabricated by conventional methods that limit the potential for complex architectures normally required for rapidly changing custom configurations. Rapid prototyping using 3D printing provides a solution for this. Previous work has shown successful extrusion 3D printing of magnetic hydrogels; however, extrusion-based printing is limited by nozzle resolution and ink viscosity. VAT photopolymerization offers a higher control over resolution and build-architecture. Liquid photo-resins with magnetic nanocomposites normally suffer from nanoparticle agglomeration due to local magnetic fields. In this work, we develop an optimised method for homogenously infusing up to 2 wt % superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) with a 10 nm diameter into a photo-resin composed of water, acrylamide and PEGDA, with improved nanoparticle homogeneity and reduced agglomeration during printing. The 3D printed starfish hydrogels exhibited high mechanical stability and robust mechanical properties with a maximum Youngs modulus of 1.8 MPa and limited shape deformation of 10% when swollen. Each individual arm of the starfish could be magnetically actuated when a remote magnetic field is applied. The starfish could grab onto a magnet with all arms when a central magnetic field was applied. Ultimately, these hydrogels retained their shape post-printing and returned to their original formation once the magnetic field had been removed. These hydrogels can be used across a wide range of applications, including soft robotics and magnetically stimulated actuators.",

YC3.60 is one of the most widely used fundamental calcium ion indicator proteins and is a tandem protein consisting of cyan fluorescent protein, calmodulin, and yellow fluorescent protein. Our results show that the conformational heterogeneity of YC3.60 leads to multiple FRET (fluorescence resonance energy transfer) processes occurring in a variety of structures. In the presence of calcium ions, FRET occurs in 75% of all YC3.60 molecules, and the intramolecular FRET faster than 20 ps is dominant among the three different FRET processes. Even in the absence of calcium ions, FRET occurs in 28% of YC3.60, where intra- and intermolecular FRET with a time constant of 160 ps is dominant among the four different FRET processes. YC3.60 with the immature chromophore, which is 25% of the total, would result in lower contrast on imaging. Conformational heterogeneity arises from the specific association of the two fluorescent proteins. It was clearly shown that the association of fluorescent proteins has a significant impact on the fluorescence mechanism. These observations lead to the promotion of research that elucidates the relationship between the higher-order structure and function of proteins.",

After tamoxifen inducement, the two groups of Gli1<sup>+</sup>-MSC were screened by green fluorescent protein (GFP) labeling and flow cytometry sorting. PDGFRα was conditionally knocked out in the experimental group, and the control group Gli1<sup>+</sup>-MSC expressed PDGFRα normally. The two groups of Gli1<sup>+</sup>-MSC were subjected to adipogenic induction and fibrogenic induction, the Western blotting was performed to detect PDGFRα, adipocyte markers [perilipin and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha (C/EBPα)] and fibrogenic markers [alpha smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and fibroblast-specific protein 1 (FSP-1)] and semi-quantitative analysis was performed. The degree of cellular adipose differentiation after bidirectional induction of Gli1+-MSC in both groups was observed by oil red O staining and analyzed semi-quantitatively. <b>Results:</b> After tamoxifen induction, Gli1<sup>+</sup>-MSC could be accurately isolated from flow cytometry by GFP labeling. Via adipogenic differentiation, the expression of PDGFRα in the experimental group (0.017±0.002) was significantly lower than that in the control group (0.184±0.012) (<i>t</i>=25.48，<i>P</i>=0.002).

Unique features of the DGT-SSETV-μCCP-OES are low power and low Ar consumption for plasma generation (15 W, 150 mL min<sup>-1</sup>) and significant improvement of the detection limits following DGT passive sampling. The new method was validated in terms of river water analysis in comparison with graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry and thermal decomposition atomic absorption spectrometry. Combining the abilities of preconcentration by in-situ Chelex-DGT passive sampling with plasma microtorch equipped with a low resolution microspectrometer provided multielemental simultaneous determination with detection limits of (μg L<sup>-1</sup>) 0.01 (Cd, Zn and Hg), 0.02 (Cu) and 0.07 (Pb) in water, at least one order of magnitude better than using grab sampling without preconcentration. It was possible the quantification of labile fraction of priority hazardous metals (Cd, Pb) in river water below the instrumental limits of detection (μg L<sup>-1</sup>) of 0.12 and 0.80 obtained in SSETV-μCCP-OES without DGT sampling. The precision of the method was in the range 15.3-22.4% (combined uncertainty), while the accuracy was 95-103% and trueness of 27-33% (expanded uncertainty, k = 2). The DGT-SSETV-μCCP-OES coupling proved to be an ideal and powerful tool for surface water analysis in compliance with green and white analytical chemistry concepts. The application of the RGB-12 algorithm provided very good red/green (AGREEprep)/blue/white scores (%) of 100/80/98/93, determined primarily by in-situ DGT passive sampling, very good detection limits and cost-effective SSETV-μCCP-OES instrumentation.",

Complete decellularization of longer and tubular aortic sections suitable for clinical application has not been achieved so far. The present study aims at analyzing the effect of pressure application on decellularization efficacy of porcine aortas using a device specifically designed for this purpose. Fresh porcine descending aortas of 8 cm length were decellularized using detergents. To increase decellularization efficacy, detergent treatment was combined with pressure application and different treatment schemes. Quantification of penetration depth as well as histological staining, scanning electron microscopy, and tensile strength tests were used to evaluate tissue structure. In general, application of pressure to aortic tissue does neither increase the decellularization success nor the penetration depth of detergents. However, it is of importance from which side of the aorta the pressure is applied. Application of intermittent pressure from the adventitial side does significantly increase the decellularization degree at the intimal side (compared to the reference group), but had no influence on the penetration depth of SDC/SDS at both sides. Although the present setup does not significantly improve the decellularization success of aortas, it is interesting that the application of pressure from the adventitial side leads to improved decellularization of the intimal side. As no adverse effects on tissue structure nor on mechanical properties were observed, optimization of the present protocol may potentially lead to complete decellularization of larger aortic segments.",

In this study, the wild-type P. chrysogenum VTCC 31172 strain was re-classified as P. rubens by a multilocus sequencing analysis. Further, the pyrG gene required for uridine/uracil biosynthesis was successfully deleted in the VTCC 31172 strain by homologous recombination to generate a stable uridine/uracil auxotrophic mutant (ΔpyrG). The growth of the P. rubens ΔpyrG strain could be restored by uridine/uracil supplementation, and a new ATMT system based on the uridine/uracil auxotrophic mechanism was established for this strain. The optimal ATMT efficiency could reach 1750 transformants for 10<sup>6</sup> spores (equivalent to 0.18%). In addition, supplementation of uridine/uracil at the concentrations of 0.005-0.02% during the co-cultivation process significantly promoted transformation efficiency. Especially, we demonstrated that the pyrG marker and the amyB promoter from the koji mold Aspergillus oryzae were fully functional in P. rubens ΔpyrG. Expression of the DsRed reporter gene under the regulation of the A. oryzae amyB promoter lighted up the mycelium of P. rubens with a robust red signal under fluorescence microscopy. Furthermore, genomic integration of multiple copies of the Aspergillus fumigatus phyA gene under the control of the amyB promoter significantly enhanced phytase activity in P. rubens. The ATMT system developed in our work provides a safe genetic platform for producing recombinant products in P. rubens without using drug resistance markers.",

        "abstract": "The mesolimbic dopamine system is an evolutionarily conserved set of brain circuits that play a role in attention, appetitive behavior, and reward processing. In this circuitry, ascending dopaminergic projections from the ventral midbrain innervate targets throughout the limbic forebrain, such as the ventral striatum/nucleus accumbens (NAc). Dopaminergic signaling in the NAc has been widely studied for its role in behavioral reinforcement, reward prediction error encoding, and motivational salience. Less well characterized is the role of dopaminergic neurotransmission in the response to surprising or alerting sensory events. To address this, we used the genetically encoded dopamine sensor dLight1 and fiber photometry to explore the ability of striatal dopamine release to encode the properties of salient sensory stimuli in mice, such as threatening looming discs. Here, we report that lateral NAc (LNAc) dopamine release encodes the rate and magnitude of environmental luminance changes rather than the visual stimulus threat level. This encoding is highly sensitive, as LNAc dopamine could be evoked by light intensities that were imperceptible to human experimenters. We also found that light-evoked dopamine responses are wavelength-dependent at low irradiances, independent of the circadian cycle, robust to previous exposure history, and involve multiple phototransduction pathways. Thus, we have further elaborated the mesolimbic dopamine system's ability to encode visual information in mice, which is likely relevant to a wide body of scientists employing light sources or optical methods in behavioral research involving rodents.",

        "abstract": "pH-sensitive fluorescent proteins are widely used to study synaptic vesicle (SV) fusion and recycling. When targeted to the lumen of SVs, fluorescence of these proteins is quenched by the acidic pH. Following SV fusion, they are exposed to extracellular neutral pH, resulting in a fluorescence increase. SV fusion, recycling and acidification can thus be tracked by tagging integral SV proteins with pH-sensitive proteins. Neurotransmission is generally activated by electrical stimulation, which is not feasible in small, intact animals. Previous <i>in vivo</i> approaches depended on distinct (sensory) stimuli, thus limiting the addressable neuron types. To overcome these limitations, we established an all-optical approach to stimulate and visualize SV fusion and recycling. We combined distinct pH-sensitive fluorescent proteins (inserted into the SV protein synaptogyrin) and light-gated channelrhodopsins (ChRs) for optical stimulation, overcoming optical crosstalk and thus enabling an all-optical approach. We generated two different variants of the pH-sensitive optogenetic reporter of vesicle recycling (pOpsicle) and tested them in cholinergic neurons of intact <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> nematodes. First, we combined the red fluorescent protein pHuji with the blue-light gated ChR2(H134R), and second, the green fluorescent pHluorin combined with the novel red-shifted ChR ChrimsonSA. In both cases, fluorescence increases were observed after optical stimulation. Increase and subsequent decline of fluorescence was affected by mutations of proteins involved in SV fusion and endocytosis. These results establish pOpsicle as a non-invasive, all-optical approach to investigate different steps of the SV cycle.",

Harnessing large-scale additive manufacturing of biological materials, we examined the addition of cell-free protein expression systems (\"TXTL\" i.e., biological transcription-translation machinery without the use of living cells) to printed structures. This allowed us to consider programmable, living-like, responsive systems for product design and indoor architectural applications. This emergent, pluripotent technology offers exciting potential in support of health, resource optimization, and reduction of energy use in the built environment, setting a new path to interactivity with mechanical, optical, and (bio) chemical properties throughout structures. We propose a roadmap towards creating healthier, functional and more durable systems by deploying a multiscale platform containing biologically-active components encapsulated within biopolymer lattices operating at three design scales: (i) supporting cell-free protein expression in a biopolymer matrix (microscale), (ii) varying material properties of porosity and strength within two-dimensional lattices to support biological and structural functions (mesoscale), and (iii) obtaining folded indoor surfaces that are structurally sound at the meter scale and biologically active (we label that regime macroscale). We embedded commercially available cell-free protein expression systems within silk fibroin and sodium alginate biopolymer matrices and used green fluorescent protein as the reporter to confirm their compatibility. We demonstrate mechanical attachment of freeze-dried bioactive pellets into printed foldable fibrous biopolymer lattices showing the first steps towards modular multiscale fabrication of large structures with biologically active zones.

Although sophisticated regulatory networks maintain proper homeostasis to prevent damage, the tolerance thresholds to these stresses vary significantly among organisms. Current plant phenotyping techniques and observables must be better suited to characterize the real-time metabolic response to stresses. This impedes practical agronomic intervention to avoid irreversible damage and limits our ability to breed improved plant organisms. Here, we introduce a sensitive, wearable electrochemical glucose-selective sensing platform that addresses these problems. Glucose is a primary plant metabolite, a source of energy produced during photosynthesis, and a critical molecular modulator of various cellular processes ranging from germination to senescence. The wearable-like technology integrates a reverse iontophoresis glucose extraction capability with an enzymatic glucose biosensor that offers a sensitivity of 22.7 nA/(μM·cm<sup>2</sup>), a limit of detection (LOD) of 9.4 μM, and a limit of quantification (LOQ) of 28.5 μM. The system's performance was validated by subjecting three different plant models (sweet pepper, gerbera, and romaine lettuce) to low-light and low-high temperature stresses and demonstrating critical differential physiological responses associated with their glucose metabolism. This technology enables non-invasive, non-destructive, real-time, in-situ, and in-vivo identification of early stress response in plants and provides a unique tool for timely agronomic management of crops and improving breeding strategies based on the dynamics of genome-metabolome-phenome relationships.",

        "abstract": "The small GTPase Ras is frequently mutated in cancer and a driver of tumorigenesis. The recent years have shown great progress in drug-targeting Ras and understanding how it operates on the plasma membrane. We now know that Ras is non-randomly organized into proteo-lipid complexes on the membrane, called nanoclusters. Nanoclusters contain only a few Ras proteins and are necessary for the recruitment of downstream effectors, such as Raf. If tagged with fluorescent proteins, the dense packing of Ras in nanoclusters can be analyzed by Förster/ fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). Loss of FRET can therefore report on decreased nanoclustering and any process upstream of it, such as Ras lipid modifications and correct trafficking. Thus, cellular FRET screens employing Ras-derived fluorescence biosensors are potentially powerful tools to discover chemical or genetic modulators of functional Ras membrane organization. Here we implement fluorescence anisotropy-based homo-FRET measurements of Ras-derived constructs labelled with only one fluorescent protein on a confocal microscope and a fluorescence plate reader. We show that homo-FRET of both H-Ras- and K-Ras-derived constructs can sensitively report on Ras-lipidation and -trafficking inhibitors, as well as on genetic perturbations of proteins regulating membrane anchorage. By exploiting the switch I/II-binding Ras-dimerizing compound BI-2852, this assay is also suitable to report on the engagement of the K-Ras switch II pocket by small molecules such as AMG 510. Given that homo-FRET only requires one fluorescent protein tagged Ras construct, this approach has significant advantages to create Ras-nanoclustering FRET-biosensor reporter cell lines, as compared to the more common hetero-FRET approaches.",

In this retrospective cohort study, we used a telephone survey and chart review to assess the incidence of post-transplant harmful alcohol relapse, risk factors, and long-term outcomes for patients transplanted for alcohol-associated cirrhosis at our center from 2002 to 2016. Over the median follow-up of 5.9 years, 20.4% relapsed, with 9.3% harmful relapse after median of 4.0 years. The survey response rate was 44.0% (n=110). Of survey responders, 44.3% did not recall discussing alcohol in post-transplant clinics, and 17.6% of relapses were identified by the survey alone. In univariate analysis, shorter pretransplant sobriety (OR: 0.96 per month, p=0.02) and history of pretransplant relapse (OR: 2.99, p=0.02) were associated with post-transplant harmful relapse. After adjusting for these factors, High-risk Alcoholism Relapse score ≥4 predicted harmful relapse (OR: 3.43, p=0.049). A total of 27.3% of patients with both pretransplant relapse and High-risk Alcoholism Relapse score ≥4 relapsed to harmful use compared with 5.2% of those with 1 or neither risk factor (p < 0.001). Harmful relapse was associated with increased graft loss (30.4% vs. 17.4%) and inferior 10-year post-liver transplant survival (61.5% vs. 80.7%). Incorporating patient survey data allowed the detection of relapses otherwise unreported to clinicians, highlighting the need for novel strategies to detect relapse. Utilizing this augmented data, we identified pretransplant sobriety length, pretransplant relapse, and High-risk Alcoholism Relapse score ≥4 as risk factors that should be evaluated pretransplant to guide candidate selection and peritransplant alcohol use disorder management.",

Here, we introduce TFBMiner, a new data mining and analysis pipeline that enables the automated and rapid identification of putative metabolite-responsive transcription factor-based biosensors (TFBs). This user-friendly command line tool harnesses a heuristic rule-based model of gene organization to identify both gene clusters involved in the catabolism of user-defined molecules and their associated transcriptional regulators. Ultimately, biosensors are scored based on how well they fit the model, providing wet-lab scientists with a ranked list of candidates that can be experimentally tested. We validated the pipeline using a set of molecules for which TFBs have been reported previously, including sensors responding to sugars, amino acids, and aromatic compounds, among others. We further demonstrated the utility of TFBMiner by identifying a biosensor for S-mandelic acid, an aromatic compound for which a responsive transcription factor had not been found previously. Using a combinatorial library of mandelate-producing microbial strains, the newly identified biosensor was able to distinguish between low- and high-producing strain candidates.

        "abstract": "Efforts to leverage clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (CRISPR/Cas9) for targeted genomic modifications in mammalian cells are limited by low efficiencies and heterogeneous outcomes. To aid method optimization, we developed an all-in-one reporter system, including a novel superfolder orange fluorescent protein (sfOrange), to simultaneously quantify gene disruption, site-specific integration (SSI), and random integration (RI). SSI strategies that utilize different donor plasmid formats and Cas9 nuclease variants were evaluated for targeting accuracy and efficiency in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Double-cut and double-nick donor formats significantly improved targeting accuracy by 2.3-8.3-fold and 19-22-fold, respectively, compared to standard circular donors. Notably, Cas9-mediated donor linearization was associated with increased RI events, whereas donor nicking minimized RI without sacrificing SSI efficiency and avoided low-fidelity outcomes. A screen of 10 molecules that modulate the major mammalian DNA repair pathways identified two inhibitors that further enhance targeting accuracy and efficiency to achieve SSI in 25% of transfected cells without selection. The optimized methods integrated transgene expression cassettes with 96% efficiency at a single locus and with 53%-55% efficiency at two loci simultaneously in selected clones. The CRISPR-based tools and methods developed here could inform the use of CRISPR/Cas9 in mammalian cell lines, accelerate mammalian cell line engineering, and support advanced recombinant protein production applications.",

Recent studies of maltose binding protein (MBP) using ultrasensitive <sup>129</sup>Xe NMR spectroscopy identified a switchable salt bridge which causes slow xenon exchange and elicits strong hyperpolarized <sup>129</sup>Xe chemical exchange saturation transfer (hyper-CEST) NMR contrast. To engineer the first genetically encoded, NMR-active sensor for Zn<sup>2+</sup>, we converted the MBP salt bridge into a Zn<sup>2+</sup> binding site, while preserving the specific xenon binding cavity.

Conceptually, this can be achieved by fusing a small, antibody-like binding domain to a fluorescent protein in such a way that target binding activates fluorescence. Although this design is simple to envision, its execution is not obvious. Here, we created a family of adaptable, turn-on monobody (ATOM) biosensors consisting of a monobody, circularly permuted at one of two positions, inserted into a fluorescent protein at one of three surface loops. Multiplexed imaging of live human cells co-expressing cyan, yellow, and red ATOM sensors detected the biosensor targets (WDR5, SH2, and hRAS proteins) that were localized to the nucleus, cytoplasm, and plasma membrane, respectively, with high specificity. ER- and mitochondria-localized ATOM sensors also detected ligands that were targeted to those organelles. Fluorescence activation involved ligand-dependent chromophore maturation with fluorescence turn-on ratios of >20-fold in cells and up to 100-fold <i>in vitro</i> . The sensing mechanism was validated with three arbitrarily chosen monobodies inserted into jellyfish as well as anemone lineages of fluorescent proteins, suggesting that ATOM sensors with different binding specificities and additional colors can be generated relatively quickly.",

        "abstract": "Visceral smooth muscle cells (SMCs) are an integral component of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract that regulate GI motility. SMC contraction is regulated by posttranslational signaling and the state of differentiation. Impaired SMC contraction is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, but the mechanisms regulating SMC-specific contractile gene expression, including the role of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), remain largely unexplored. Herein, we reveal a critical role of Carmn (cardiac mesoderm enhancer-associated noncoding RNA), an SMC-specific lncRNA, in regulating visceral SMC phenotype and contractility of the GI tract. Genotype-Tissue Expression and publicly available single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data sets from embryonic, adult human, and mouse GI tissues were interrogated to identify SMC-specific lncRNAs. The functional role of Carmn was investigated using novel green fluorescent protein (GFP) knock-in (KI) reporter/knock-out (KO) mice. Bulk RNA-seq and single nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) of colonic muscularis were used to investigate underlying mechanisms. Unbiased in silico analyses and GFP expression patterns in Carmn GFP KI mice revealed that Carmn is highly expressed in GI SMCs in humans and mice. Premature lethality was observed in global Carmn KO and inducible SMC-specific KO mice due to GI pseudo-obstruction and severe distension of the GI tract, with dysmotility in cecum and colon segments. Histology, GI transit, and muscle myography analysis revealed severe dilation, significantly delayed GI transit, and impaired GI contractility in Carmn KO vs control mice. Bulk RNA-seq of GI muscularis revealed that loss of Carmn promotes SMC phenotypic switching, as evidenced by up-regulation of extracellular matrix genes and down-regulation of SMC contractile genes, including Mylk, a key regulator of SMC contraction. snRNA-seq further revealed SMC Carmn KO not only compromised myogenic motility by reducing contractile gene expression but also impaired neurogenic motility by disrupting cell-cell connectivity in the colonic muscularis. These findings may have translational significance, because silencing CARMN in human colonic SMCs significantly attenuated contractile gene expression, including MYLK, and decreased SMC contractility. Luciferase reporter assays showed that CARMN enhances the transactivation activity of the master regulator of SMC contractile phenotype, myocardin, thereby maintaining the GI SMC myogenic program. Our data suggest that Carmn is indispensable for maintaining GI SMC contractile function in mice and that loss of function of CARMN may contribute to human visceral myopathy. To our knowledge this is the first study showing an essential role of lncRNA in the regulation of visceral SMC phenotype.",

One of the main challenges in the development of such platforms is the immobilization matrix that is used to keep the cells stable, which also affects the portability of the device. In this study, a portable and simple immobilization of bioluminescent bacterial cells in calcium alginate hydrogel was examined. The effects of several physical parameters were investigated (e.g. calcium alginate solution volume, drying, incubation time, mixing procedure, bacterial concentration, and tablet location within the cylinder). An alginate solution volume of 3 ml was preferred as well as the addition of 400 μl solution after the 15 min of compressing step and before the polymerization step. Also, a stirring mixing mode is favored over vortexing due to the creation of better homogenized tablets, as well as a bacterial concentration of 0.15 OD600nm that produced a high light response while maintaining a lower variance. Lastly, the findings showed a significantly higher response [induction factor (IF)] in the tablets using the optimized immobilization protocol (IF = 8.814) than the old one (IF = 1.979). To conclude, bacterial cells immobilization in calcium alginate tablets provides improved sensitivity and storability.",

Here, bioluminescent reporters for the maternally-expressed imprinted gene Cdkn1c are used to examine the capacity of chromatin-modifying drugs to reverse paternal Cdkn1c silencing. Exposure of reporter mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) to 5-Azacytidine, HDAC inhibitors, BET inhibitors or GSK-J4 (KDM6A/B inhibitor) relieved repression of paternal Cdkn1c, either selectively or by inducing biallelic effects. Treatment of reporter fibroblasts with HDAC inhibitors or GSK-J4 resulted in similar paternal Cdkn1c activation, whereas BET inhibitor-induced loss of imprinting was specific to mESCs. Changes in allelic expression were generally not sustained in dividing cultures upon drug removal, indicating that the underlying epigenetic memory of silencing was maintained. In contrast, Cdkn1c de-repression by GSK-J4 was retained in both mESCs and fibroblasts following inhibitor removal, although this impact may be linked to cellular stress and DNA damage. Taken together, these data introduce bioluminescent reporter cells as tools for studying epigenetic silencing and disruption, and demonstrate that Cdkn1c imprinting requires distinct and cell-type specific chromatin features and modifying enzymes to enact and propagate a memory of silencing.",

Recent methods mainly focus on designing powerful local feature extractors and generally overlook the segmentation around the boundaries between objects, which is extremely harmful to the clinical practice and degenerates the overall segmentation performance. To remedy this problem, we propose a GRAph-based Boundary-aware Network (GRAB-Net) with three paradigms, Graph-based Boundary-perception Module (GBM), Outer-boundary Context-assignment Module (OCM), and Inner-boundary Feature-rectification Module (IFM), for medical point cloud segmentation. Aiming to improve the segmentation performance around boundaries, GBM is designed to detect boundaries and interchange complementary information inside semantic and boundary features in the graph domain, where semantics-boundary correlations are modelled globally and informative clues are exchanged by graph reasoning. Furthermore, to reduce the context confusion that degenerates the segmentation performance outside the boundaries, OCM is proposed to construct the contextual graph, where dissimilar contexts are assigned to points of different categories guided by geometrical landmarks. In addition, we advance IFM to distinguish ambiguous features inside boundaries in a contrastive manner, where boundary-aware contrast strategies are proposed to facilitate the discriminative representation learning. Extensive experiments on two public datasets, IntrA and 3DTeethSeg, demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art methods.",

Marketing pressures on teenagers around food promotion continue to intensify, yet little is known about the marketing channels and specific persuasive appeals targeting this audience. Given this research gap, this participatory research study engages teenagers to capture the food marketing targeting them and to identify its persuasive \"power\" and platforms of exposure. Using a specially designed mobile app called GrabFM! (Grab Food Marketing!) teenagers (ages 13-17, n = 309) identified and tagged examples of teen-targeted food marketing in their physical and digital environments over a 7-day period. Results reveal that: 1) digital platforms dominate teen-targeted food marketing, with over three quarters of the ads found on Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok, ad YouTube; 2) branded beverages, fast food, and candy/chocolate comprise the majority (72%) of ads; and 3) the most powerful techniques for attracting teens attention are visual style, special offer and theme. In 40% of advertisements submitted, teenagers used only one indicator to identify \"teen-targeted\", although older teenagers (ages 15-17) were more likely to report multiple indicators per ad. This study provides important insights into the platforms targeting teenagers (and their relative importance), the food products endorsed, and the specific appeals that teenagers find persuasive. For the purposes of monitoring, it is helpful to know that digital platforms comprise the majority of teen-directed food promotions, and that the Big Food brands have been joined by countless smaller players to sell food to teens.",

In normal tissues, tissue-specific CpG methylation patterns are established during development. In contrast, alterations in methylation patterns have been observed in abnormal cells, such as cancer cells. Cancer type-specific CpG methylation patterns have been identified and used as biomarkers for cancer diagnosis. In this study, we developed a hybridization-based CpG methylation level sensing system using a methyl-CpG-binding domain (MBD)-fused fluorescent protein. In this system, the target DNA is captured by a complementary methylated probe DNA. When the target DNA is methylated, a symmetrically methylated CpG is formed in the double-stranded DNA. MBD specifically recognizes symmetrical methyl-CpG on double-stranded DNA; therefore, the methylation level is quantified by measuring the fluorescence intensity of the bound MBD-fused fluorescent protein. We prepared MBD-fused AcGFP1 and quantified the CpG methylation levels of the target DNA against <i>SEPT9</i>, <i>BRCA1</i>, and long interspersed nuclear element-1 (LINE-1) using MBD-AcGFP1.

Here, we find that cell wall damage causes increased crowding effects in the <i>Escherichia coli</i> cytoplasm. Using a genetically encoded macromolecular crowding sensor, we see that crowding effects in spheroplasts and penicillin-treated cells well surpass crowding effects obtained using hyperosmotic stress. The crowding increase is not because of osmotic pressure, cell shape, or volume changes and therefore not crowder concentration. Instead, a genetically encoded nucleic acid stain and a DNA stain show cytoplasmic mixing and nucleoid expansion, which could cause these increased crowding effects.

        "abstract": "Activated glia are known to exhibit either neuroprotective or neurodegenerative effects, depending on their phenotype, while participating in chronic pain regulation. Until recently, it has been believed that satellite glial cells and astrocytes are electrically slight and process stimuli only through intracellular calcium flux that triggers downstream signaling mechanisms. Though glia do not exhibit action potentials, they do express both voltage- and ligand-gated ion channels that facilitate measurable calcium transients, a measure of their own phenotypic excitability, and support and modulate sensory neuron excitability through ion buffering and secretion of excitatory or inhibitory neuropeptides (i.e., paracrine signaling). We recently developed a model of acute and chronic nociception using co-cultures of iPSC sensory neurons (SN) and spinal astrocytes on microelectrode arrays (MEAs). Until recently, only neuronal extracellular activity has been recorded using MEAs with a high signal-to-noise ratio and in a non-invasive manner. Unfortunately, this method has limited compatibility with simultaneous calcium transient imaging techniques, which is the most common method for monitoring the phenotypic activity of astrocytes. Moreover, both dye-based and genetically encoded calcium indicator imaging rely on calcium chelation, affecting the culture's long-term physiology. Therefore, it would be ideal to allow continuous and simultaneous direct phenotypic monitoring of both SNs and astrocytes in a high-to-moderate throughput non-invasive manner and would significantly advance the field of electrophysiology. Here, we characterize astrocytic oscillating calcium transients (OCa<sup>2+</sup>Ts) in mono- and co-cultures of iPSC astrocytes as well as iPSC SN-astrocyte co-cultures on 48 well plate MEAs. We demonstrate that astrocytes exhibit OCa<sup>2+</sup>Ts in an electrical stimulus amplitude- and duration-dependent manner. We show that OCa<sup>2+</sup>Ts can be pharmacologically inhibited with the gap junction antagonist, carbenoxolone (100 μM). Most importantly, we demonstrate that both neurons and glia can be phenotypically characterized in real time, repeatedly, over the duration of the culture. In total, our findings suggest that calcium transients in glial populations may serve as a stand-alone or supplemental screening technique for identifying potential analgesics or compounds targeting other glia-mediated pathologies.",

To facilitate ongoing efforts to understand underlying mechanisms and to work toward carrying out investigations in cells in situ, we describe the suitability and advantages of using isolated murine adrenal chromaffin cells expressing, in a Cre-dependent manner, the genetically-encoded Ca2+indicator GCaMP6f. Initial experiments confirmed that Ca2+ responses evoked by a 5 ns pulse were similar between fluorescent Ca2+ indicator-loaded murine and bovine chromaffin cells, thereby establishing that 5 ns-elicited excitation of chromaffin cells occurs reproducibly across species. In GCaMP6f-expressing murine chromaffin cells, spontaneous Ca2+ activity as well as nicotinic receptor agonist- and 5 ns evoked-Ca2+ responses consistently displayed similar kinetic characteristics as those in dye-loaded cells but with two-twentyfold greater amplitudes and without photobleaching. The high signal-to-noise ratio of evoked Ca2+ responses as well as spontaneous Ca2+ activity was observed in cells derived from Sox10-Cre, conditional GCaMP6f mice or TH-Cre, conditional GCaMP6f mice, although the number of cells expressing GCaMP6f at sufficiently high levels for achieving high signal-to-noise ratios was greater in Sox10-Cre mice. As in bovine cells, Ca2+ responses elicited in murine GCaMP6f-expressing cells by a 5 ns pulse were mediated by the activation of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels but not tetrodotoxin-sensitive voltage-gated Na+ channels. We conclude that genetically targeting GCaMP6f expression to murine chromaffin cells represents a sensitive and valuable approach to investigate spontaneous, receptor agonist- and nanosecond electric pulse-induced Ca2+ responses in vitro. This approach will also facilitate future studies investigating the effects of ultrashort electric pulses on cells in ex vivo slices of adrenal gland, which will lay the foundation for using nanosecond electric pulses to stimulate neurosecretion in vivo.",

Pharmacological and genetic manipulations reveal that the Ado release depends on equilibrative nucleoside transporters but not the conventional vesicular release mechanisms. Compared with the fast-vesicular glutamate release, the Ado release is slow (~40 s) and requires calcium influx through L-type calcium channels. Thus, this study reveals an activity-dependent second-to-minute local Ado release from the somatodendritic compartments of neurons, potentially serving modulatory functions as a retrograde signal.",

We have developed a method to noninvasively detect specific C3 fragment deposition throughout both kidneys, using a monoclonal antibody targeting tissue-bound iC3b/C3d linked to a bioluminescent resonance energy transfer construct that emits near-infrared light. In a mouse model of glomerulonephritis, the probe detected iC3b/C3d in kidneys of live mice by bioluminescent imaging.

Despite numerous efforts, the regulation of this process in land plants is largely unknown. Here, we report the isolation and characterization of pale green Arabidopsis4 (pga4) mutants in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) with defects in chloroplast development during de-etiolation. Map-based cloning and complementation assays confirmed that PGA4 encodes the chloroplast Signal Recognition Particle 54 kDa (cpSRP54) protein. A heterogeneous Light-Harvesting Chlorophyll a/b Binding-Green Fluorescent Protein (LhcB2-GFP) fusion protein was generated as an indicative reporter for cpSRP54-mediated thylakoid translocation. LhcB2-GFP was dysfunctional and degraded to a short-form dLhcB2-GFP during de-etiolation through an N-terminal degradation initiated on thylakoid membranes. Further biochemical and genetic evidence demonstrated that the degradation of LhcB2-GFP to dLhcB2-GFP was disrupted in pga4 and yellow variegated2 (var2) mutants caused by mutations in the Filamentous Temperature-Sensitive H2 (VAR2/AtFtsH2) subunit of thylakoid FtsH. The yeast two-hybrid assay showed that the N-terminus of LhcB2-GFP interacts with the protease domain of VAR2/AtFtsH2. Moreover, the over-accumulated LhcB2-GFP in pga4 and var2 formed protein aggregates, which were insoluble in mild nonionic detergents. Genetically, cpSRP54 is a suppressor locus for the leaf variegation phenotype of var2. Together, these results demonstrate the coordination of cpSRP54 and thylakoid FtsH in maintaining thylakoid membrane PQC during the assembly of photosynthetic complexes and provide a trackable substrate and product for monitoring cpSRP54-dependent protein translocation and FtsH-dependent protein degradation.",

LifeAct-GFP expression was tolerated at a higher expression level compared with EGFP-actin and AC-GFP with only subtle differences identified in dendritic spine morphology and protrusion density. While EGFP-actin and LifeAct-GFP expression did not alter dendritic arborization, AC-GFP-expressing neurons displayed a reduced dendritic tree.

In longitudinal studies, tumor growth (or regression) of glioblastoma can only be monitored by noninvasive imaging. For this purpose, bioluminescence imaging (BLI) has gained popularity because of its low cost and easy access. In the context of the development of new nanomedicines for treating glioblastoma, we were using luciferase-expressing GL261 cell lines. Incidentally, using BLI in a specific GL261 glioblastoma model with cells expressing both luciferase and the green fluorescent protein (GL261-luc-GFP), we observed an apparent spontaneous regression. By contrast, the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) analysis revealed that the tumors were actually growing over time. For other models (GL261 expressing only luciferase and U87 expressing both luciferase and GFP), data from BLI and MRI correlated well. We found that the divergence in results coming from different imaging modalities was not due to the tumor localization nor the penetration depth of light but was rather linked to the instability in luciferase expression in the viral construct used for the GL261-luc-GFP model. In conclusion, the use of multi-modality imaging prevents possible errors in tumor growth evaluation, and checking the stability of luciferase expression is mandatory when using BLI as the sole imaging modality.",

It is crucial to develop a rapid and simultaneous assay to distinguish and quantify live and dead S.T in foods. Herein, one dual-mode biosensor for simultaneous detection of live and dead S.T was fabricated based on two phage probes, using portable bioluminescence and fluorescent meter as detectors, respectively. Firstly, a magnetic phage capture probe (M-P1) and a phage signal tag (P2-S) labeled with SYTO 13 fluorescent dye were prepared, respectively. Both M-P1 and P2-S can specifically conjugate with S.T to form a magnetic sandwich complex. After magnetic separation, the isolated complex can emit a fluorescent signal under an excited 365 nm laser, which can reflect the total amount of S.T. Afterwards, the lysozyme was added to decompose the captured live S.T, which can release ATP and produce a bioluminescent signal corresponding to the live S.T amount. The dead S.T concentration can be deduced by the difference between total and live examples. The detection limit of 55 CFU/mL for total S.T and 9 CFU/mL for live ones was within 20 min. The assay was successfully employed in milk samples and prospectively for on-site screening of other dead and live bacteria, while changing the phages for the targets.",

In particular, the redox-sensitive green fluorescent protein (roGFP)-based proteins fused to peroxiredoxins are among the most sensitive H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> biosensors.

Furthermore, probe oxidation upon the addition of extracellular peroxides is also quantitatively similar, suggesting comparable plasma membrane H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> gradients. Finally, as a proof of concept, we have applied different concentrations of zinc to all three model systems and have detected probe oxidation, demonstrating that an excess of this metal can cause fluctuations of peroxides, which are moderate in yeasts and severe in mammalian cells.

Transmission exists in two principal modes: action-potential (AP) evoked and AP-independent, \"spontaneous\" transmission. AP-evoked neurotransmission is considered the primary mode of inter-neuronal communication, whereas spontaneous transmission is required for neuronal development, homeostasis, and plasticity. While some synapses appear dedicated to spontaneous transmission only, all AP-responsive synapses also engage spontaneously, but whether this encodes functional information regarding their excitability is unknown. Here we report on functional interdependence of both transmission modes at individual synaptic contacts of <i>Drosophila</i> larval neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) which were identified by the presynaptic scaffolding protein Bruchpilot (BRP) and whose activities were quantified using the genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator GCaMP. Consistent with the role of BRP in organizing the AP-dependent release machinery (voltage-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels and SV fusion machinery), most active BRP-positive synapses (>85%) responded to APs. At these synapses, the level of spontaneous activity was a predictor for their responsiveness to AP-stimulation. AP-stimulation resulted in cross-depletion of spontaneous activity and both transmission modes were affected by the non-specific Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel blocker cadmium and engaged overlapping postsynaptic receptors. Thus, by using overlapping machinery, spontaneous transmission is a continuous, stimulus independent predictor for the AP-responsiveness of individual synapses.",

Therefore, developing safe and effective delivery vehicles is critical for fundamental biomedical research and clinical applications. In this study, we designed an octopus-like self-releasing intracellular protein transporter, the LEB5, based on the heat-labile enterotoxin. This carrier comprises five identical units, each of which has three main components: a linker, a self-releasing enzyme sensitivity loop, and the LTB transport domain. The LEB5 comprises five purified monomers that self-assemble to create a pentamer with ganglioside GM1 binding capacity. The fluorescent protein EGFP was used as a reporter system to identify the LEB5 features. The high-purity fusion protein ELEB monomer was produced from modified bacteria carrying pET24a(+)-eleb recombinant plasmids. EGFP protein could effectively detach from LEB5 by low dosage trypsin, according to electrophoresis analysis. The transmission electron microscopy results indicate that both LEB5 and ELEB5 pentamers exhibit a relatively regularly spherical shape, and the differential scanning calorimetry measurements further suggest that these proteins possess excellent thermal stability. Fluorescence microscopy revealed that LEB5 translocated EGFP into different cell types. Flow cytometry showed cellular differences in the transport capacity of LEB5. According to the confocal microscopy, fluorescence analysis and western blotting data, EGFP was transferred to the endoplasmic reticulum by the LEB5 carrier, detached from LEB5 by cleavage of the enzyme-sensitive loop, and released into the cytoplasm. Within the dosage range of LEB5 10-80 μg/mL, cell counting kit-8 assay revealed no significant changes in cell viability.

Using neuroanatomical and electrophysiological methods we demonstrate that in addition to pyramidal neurons, multiple types of cortical GABAegic cells are targeted by adeno-associated viral vectors (AAV) driven by the CaMKIIα promoter in both male and female mice. We tested the AAV5 and AAV9 serotype of viruses with either Channelrhodopsin 2 (ChR2)-mCherry or Archaerhodopsin-T-green fluorescent protein (GFP) constructs, with different dilutions.

Importantly, the expression of the excitatory opsin Channelrhodopsin 2 in the interneurons effectively drive spiking of infected GABAergic cells even if the immunodetectability of reporter proteins is ambiguous.

However, the lack of internal controls subject functional bioluminescence to a number of unpredictable variables that reduce this powerful tool to semi-quantitative interpretation of large-scale effects. Here, we report the generation of sensitive and quantitative live reporters for two key measures of functional cancer biology and pharmacologic stress: the cell cycle and oxidative stress. We developed a two-colored readout, where two independent enzymes convert a common imaging substrate into spectrally distinguishable light. The signal intensity of one color is dependent upon the biological state, whereas the other color is constitutively expressed. The ratio of emitted colored light corrects the functional signal for independent procedural variables, substantially improving the robustness and interpretation of relatively low-fold changes in functional signal intensity after drug treatment. The application of these readouts in vitro is highly advantageous, as peak cell response to therapy can now be readily visualized for single or combination treatments and not simply assessed at an arbitrary and destructive timepoint. Spectral imaging in vivo can be challenging, but we also present evidence to show that the reporters can work in this context as well. Collectively, the development and validation of these internally controlled reporters allow researchers to robustly and dynamically visualize tumor cell biology in response to treatment. Given the prevalence of bioluminescence imaging, this presents significant and much needed opportunities for preclinical therapeutic development.",

        "abstract": "The use of water contaminated with Salmonella for produce production contributes to foodborne disease burden. To reduce human health risks, there is a need for novel, targeted approaches for assessing the pathogen status of agricultural water. We investigated the utility of water microbiome data for predicting Salmonella contamination of streams used to source water for produce production. Grab samples were collected from 60 New York streams in 2018 and tested for Salmonella. Separately, DNA was extracted from the samples and used for Illumina shotgun metagenomic sequencing. Reads were trimmed and used to assign taxonomy with Kraken2. Conditional forest (CF), regularized random forest (RRF), and support vector machine (SVM) models were implemented to predict Salmonella contamination. Model performance was assessed using 10-fold cross-validation repeated 10 times to quantify area under the curve (AUC) and Kappa score. CF models outperformed the other two algorithms based on AUC (0.86, CF; 0.81, RRF; 0.65, SVM) and Kappa score (0.53, CF; 0.41, RRF; 0.12, SVM). The taxa that were most informative for accurately predicting Salmonella contamination based on CF were compared to taxa identified by ALDEx2 as being differentially abundant between Salmonella-positive and -negative samples. CF and differential abundance tests both identified Aeromonas salmonicida (variable importance [VI] = 0.012) and <i>Aeromonas</i> sp. strain CA23 (VI = 0.025) as the two most informative taxa for predicting Salmonella contamination. Our findings suggest that microbiome-based models may provide an alternative to or complement existing water monitoring strategies. Similarly, the informative taxa identified in this study warrant further investigation as potential indicators of Salmonella contamination of agricultural water. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Understanding the associations between surface water microbiome composition and the presence of foodborne pathogens, such as Salmonella, can facilitate the identification of novel indicators of Salmonella contamination. This study assessed the utility of microbiome data and three machine learning algorithms for predicting Salmonella contamination of Northeastern streams. The research reported here both expanded the knowledge on the microbiome composition of surface waters and identified putative novel indicators (i.e., <i>Aeromonas</i> species) for Salmonella in Northeastern streams. These putative indicators warrant further research to assess whether they are consistent indicators of Salmonella contamination across regions, waterways, and years not represented in the data set used in this study. Validated indicators identified using microbiome data may be used as targets in the development of rapid (e.g., PCR-based) detection assays for the assessment of microbial safety of agricultural surface waters.",

The genetically encoded sensor, GRAB<sub>eCB2.0,</sub> detects real-time changes in eCB levels in cells in culture and preclinical model systems; however, its activation by eCB analogues produced by cells and by phyto-cannabinoids remains uncharacterized, a current limitation when interpreting changes in its response. This information could provide additional utility for the tool in in vivo pharmacology studies of phyto-cannabinoid action. GRAB<sub>eCB2.0</sub> was expressed in cultured HEK293 cells. Live cell confocal microscopy and high-throughput fluorescent signal measurements. 2-AG increased GRAB<sub>eCB2.0</sub> fluorescent signal (EC<sub>50</sub> = 85 nM), and the cannabinoid 1 receptor (<b>CB</b><sub><b>1</b></sub><b>R</b>) antagonist, SR141617, decreased GRAB<sub>eCB2.0</sub> signal (<b>SR1</b>, IC<sub>50</sub> = 3.3 nM), responses that mirror their known potencies at cannabinoid 1 receptors (<b>CB</b><sub><b>1</b></sub><b>R</b>).

        "abstract": "Two-photon imaging of genetically-encoded calcium indicators (GECIs) has traditionally relied on intracranial injections of adeno-associated virus (AAV) or transgenic animals to achieve expression. Intracranial injections require an invasive surgery and result in a relatively small volume of tissue labeling. Transgenic animals, although they can have brain-wide GECI expression, often express GECIs in only a small subset of neurons, may have abnormal behavioral phenotypes, and are currently limited to older generations of GECIs. Inspired by recent developments in the synthesis of AAVs that readily cross the blood brain barrier, we tested whether an alternative strategy of intravenously injecting AAV-PhP.eB is suitable for two-photon calcium imaging of neurons over many months after injection. We injected young (postnatal day 23 to 31) C57BL/6J mice with AAV-PhP.eB-Synapsin-jGCaMP7s via the retro-orbital sinus. After allowing 5 to 34 weeks for expression, we performed conventional and widefield two-photon imaging of layers 2/3, 4 and 5 of the primary visual cortex. We found reproducible trial-by-trial neural responses and tuning properties consistent with known feature selectivity in the visual cortex. Thus, intravenous injection of AAV-PhP.eB does not interfere with the normal processing in neural circuits. <i>In vivo</i> and histological images show no nuclear expression of jGCaMP7s for at least 34 weeks post-injection.",

However, traditional phosphomolybdenum blue spectrophotometry is not sensitive, is time-consuming, and demands large amounts of chemical reagents. Therefore, highly sensitive, rapid, and environmentally friendly Pi detection methods are urgently needed. Here, we developed a bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET)-based biosensor, which can detect Pi in water quickly, highly sensitively, and highly selectively. The NanoLuc and the Venus fluorescent protein were selected as the bioluminescence donor and energy acceptor, respectively. The best-performing BRET sensor variant, VenusΔC10-PΔC12-ΔN4Nluc, was identified by Pi-specific binding protein (PiBP) screening and systematic truncation. Single-factor experiments optimized the key parameters affecting the detection performance of the sensor. Under the optimal detection conditions, the detection limit of this method was 1.3 μg·L<sup>-1</sup>, the detection range was 3.3-434 μg·L<sup>-1</sup>, and it had excellent selectivity, repeatability, and stability.

Microbiome dysbiosis resulting in altered SCFA profiles is associated with certain diseases, including inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), characterized by a reduction in butyrate concentration and active intestinal inflammation. There is an increasing interest in the use of engineered bacteria as diagnostic and therapeutic tools for gut diseases. In this study, we developed genetic circuits capable of sensing SCFA concentrations to build biosensors that express a response protein (superfolder green fluorescent protein [sfGFP]) in amounts inversely proportional to the SCFA concentration. We also built biotherapeutics expressing the cytokine granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) using the same logic. The propionate biotherapeutic expressed larger amounts of mouse GM-CSF in the absence of propionate. The butyrate biotherapeutics presented the expected behavior only at the beginning of the kinetics and an accelerated response in the absence of butyrate. Overall, these genetic systems may function as complementary diagnostic tools for measuring SCFAs and as delivery vehicles for biotherapeutic molecules. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Short-chain fatty acids are key molecules produced by the gut microbiome. Their concentrations are altered in certain diseases. Here, we created molecular biosensors that quantify the absence of propionate and butyrate, using logic \"NOT\" gates and bacterial promoters.

This study investigated micro-topographically (i.e., north-/south-facing slope aspects and flat plateau between them) controlled microbial diversity and community structures across a Lesotho mountain summit. Amplicon sequence analysis revealed that the north- and south-facing slopes were dominated by more Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes, while the plateau was dominated by more Acidobacteria. Fungi from the phylum Chytridiomycota more strongly dominated the plateau and the north-facing slope than the south-facing slope.

On day 49 after elastase treatment, we performed imaging, functional analysis, and collected lungs for histology. Using immunofluorescence detection of human-specific human leukocyte antigen 1, human-specific CD31, and anti--green fluorescent protein for the reporter labeled pneumocytes, we found that transplanted cells engrafted in 14.69% ± 0.95% of the host alveoli and fully integrated to form vascularized alveoli together with host cells. Transmission electron microscopy confirmed the incorporation of the transplanted human cells and the formation of a blood-air barrier. Human endothelial cells formed perfused vasculature. Computed tomography scans revealed improved vascular density and decelerated emphysema progression in cell-treated lungs. Proliferation of both human and rat cell was higher in cell-treated versus nontreated controls.

An electroporation pulse response test using mCherry mRNA was performed to optimize the settings of the electroporator. Forty-five combinations of five pulse voltages (15, 25, 30, 35 and 40 V), three pulse durations (5, 10 and 25 ms), and three pulse frequencies (2, 5 and 6 pulses) applied at a constant 100-ms pulse interval and temperature of 37.5 °C were evaluated. The test revealed that the 35 V was the only voltage suitable for insertion of mCherry mRNA into intact rat zygotes and the only one that resulted in the production of embryos attaining the blastocyst stage. The incorporation of mCherry mRNA increased but the survival of the electroporated embryos declined with an increment in the number of pulses. Subsequent transfer of 1112 surviving Sprague Dawley rat embryos (after 8 h of incubating 1800 zygotes electroporated with the CRISPR/Cas9) resulted in the production of 287 offspring (25.8%). Ensuing PCR and phenotypic evaluation confirmed that twenty animals (6.96%) expressed eGFP in all body organs/tissues except for blood and blood vessels. The mortality of males and females before the attainment of puberty was 2 and 3 pups, respectively, and the final number/ratio of male to female of offspring was 9:11.

Advancements in arthroscopic techniques have allowed for a less invasive surgery with decreased postoperative pain, improved graft placement, and better visualization. Large bony defects of the glenoid require bone block augmentation to reduce recurrent instability. In this presentation, arthroscopically assisted anterior bone block was performed with a distal tibial allograft to address recurrent anterior shoulder instability with a large glenoid defect. The patient is placed in a lateral decubitus position. Standard arthroscopic portals are made. The bone block is fashioned from a distal tibial allograft. Using a guide, drill holes are placed in the bone block. The guide is inserted from the posterior portal and placed parallel to the joint surface. Using drill sleeves, superior and inferior screw holes are drilled and a metal cannula is left in place to allow for shuttling of suture. Two anchors are placed on the glenoid to allow for capsule labral junction to be brought up to the graft once the graft is in place. The bone block is delivered through a dilated anterior portal and reduced. The sutures are tensioned. A button is placed on each set of looped sutures, a Nice knot is placed into each, and a tensioning device is tensioned. Once compression is achieved, knots are tied to perform final fixation over the buttons. A suture passing device is used to grab inferior capsule and labrum to the priorly placed anchor on the inferior glenoid and tied. Arthroscopically assisted anterior bone block for shoulder instability has been demonstrated to have similar clinical and radiographic outcomes when compared with open treatment. However, arthroscopically assisted Latarjet has been shown to have decreased soft tissue disruption and possible improvements in graft placement. Arthroscopically assisted anterior bone block is a technically demanding surgery but has been shown to have similar outcomes when compared with open treatment.

To test the ability of the PRRSV genome to express all three reporter genes simultaneously, an expression cassette containing the Gluc gene and one containing the iLOV gene were also inserted in between ORF1b and 2 as well as ORF7 and 3'UTR, respectively. This was performed in a recently obtained infectious PRRSV cDNA clone carrying a RFP gene in nsp2. Transfection of the construct (pGX-R-Gluc-iLOV) carrying the three reporter genes into cells allowed the rescue of the recombinant reporter virus (rGX-R-Gluc-iLOV) which showed similar growth characteristics to the parental virus but yielded 100-fold less infectious viruses. Fluorescence microscopy of cells infected with rGX-R-Gluc-iLOV demonstrated the presence of both RFP and iLOV genes. Gluc activities in supernatants harvested at different time points from cells infected with recombinant viruses carrying Gluc showed increased levels of Gluc activity as the infection progressed. This indicated that Gluc gene as well as its activity were acceptable parameters to monitor viral propagation. Our results indicate that it is possible to introduce at least three foreign proteins simultaneously in a PRRSV-based vector and such studies will prove invaluable in our future understanding of these viruses.",

        "abstract": "<i>Objective.</i>Sensory nerves of the peripheral nervous system (PNS) transmit afferent signals from the body to the brain. These peripheral nerves are composed of distinct subsets of fibers and associated cell bodies, which reside in peripheral ganglia distributed throughout the viscera and along the spinal cord. The vagus nerve (cranial nerve X) is a complex polymodal nerve that transmits a wide array of sensory information, including signals related to mechanical, chemical, and noxious stimuli. To understand how stimuli applied to the vagus nerve are encoded by vagal sensory neurons in the jugular-nodose ganglia, we developed a framework for micro-endoscopic calcium imaging and analysis.<i>Approach.</i>We developed novel methods for<i>in vivo</i>imaging of the intact jugular-nodose ganglion using a miniature microscope (Miniscope) in transgenic mice with the genetically-encoded calcium indicator GCaMP6f. We adapted the Python-based analysis package Calcium Imaging Analysis (CaImAn) to process the resulting one-photon fluorescence data into calcium transients for subsequent analysis. Random forest classification was then used to identify specific types of neuronal responders.<i>Results.</i>We demonstrate that recordings from the jugular-nodose ganglia can be accomplished through careful surgical dissection and ganglia stabilization. Using a customized acquisition and analysis pipeline, we show that subsets of vagal sensory neurons respond to different chemical stimuli applied to the vagus nerve. Successful classification of the responses with a random forest model indicates that certain calcium transient features, such as amplitude and duration, are important for encoding these stimuli by sensory neurons.<i>Significance.</i>This experimental approach presents a new framework for investigating how individual vagal sensory neurons encode various stimuli on the vagus nerve. Our surgical and analytical approach can be applied to other PNS ganglia in rodents and other small animal species to elucidate previously unexplored roles for peripheral neurons in a diverse set of physiological functions.",

This study sought to understand how microbial water quality differs within and between Virginia ponds. Grab samples were collected twice per week from 30 sampling sites across nine Virginia ponds (n = 600). Samples (100 mL) were enumerated for total coliform (TC) and Escherichia coli (EC) levels, and physicochemical, weather, and environmental data were collected. Bayesian models of coregionalization were used to quantify the variance in TC and EC levels attributable to spatial (e.g., site, pond) versus nonspatial (e.g., date, pH) sources. Mixed-effects Bayesian regressions and conditional inference trees were used to characterize relationships between data and TC or EC levels. Analyses were performed separately for each pond with ≥3 sampling sites (5 intrapond) while one interpond model was developed using data from all sampling sites and all ponds. More variance in TC levels were attributable to spatial opposed to nonspatial sources for the interpond model (variance ratio [VR] = 1.55) while intrapond models were pond dependent (VR: 0.65-18.89). For EC levels, more variance was attributable to spatial sources in the interpond model (VR = 1.62), compared to all intrapond models (VR < 1.0) suggesting that more variance is attributable to nonspatial factors within individual ponds and spatial factors when multiple ponds are considered. Within each pond, TC and EC levels were spatially independent for sites 56-87 m apart, indicating that different sites within the same pond represent different water quality for risk management. Rainfall was positively and pH negatively associated with TC and EC levels in both inter- and intrapond models. For all other factors, the direction and strength of associations varied. Factors driving microbial dynamics in ponds appear to be pond-specific and differ depending on the spatial scale considered.",

Our study site was the northern part of the large, shallow, mesotrophic Lake Pyhäjärvi located in southwestern Finland. Various combinations of measurements were interpolated spatiotemporally using a data fusion system (DFS) based on an ensemble Kalman filter and smoother algorithms. The estimated concentrations together with corresponding 68% confidence intervals are presented as time series at routine sampling and automated stations, as maps and as mean values over the EU Water Framework Directive monitoring period, to evaluate the efficiency of various monitoring methods. The mean Chl-a calculated with DFS in June-September was 6.5-7.5 µg/l, depending on the observations used as input. At the routine monitoring station where grab samples were used, the average uncertainty (standard deviation, SD) decreased from 2.7 to 1.6 µg/l when EO data were also included in the estimation. At the automatic station, located 0.9 km from the routine monitoring site, the SD was 0.7 µg/l. The SD of spatial mean concentration decreased from 6.7 to 2.9 µg/l when satellite observations were included in June-September, in addition to in situ monitoring data. This demonstrates the high value of the information derived from satellite observations. The conclusion is that the confidence of Chl-a monitoring could be increased by deploying spatially extensive measurements in the form of satellite imaging or transects conducted with flow-through sensors installed on a boat and spatiotemporal interpolation of the multisource data.",

Few studies reported the structure-affinity relationship of the drug with the skin, further revealing the action sites of the drugs for enhanced permeation. Flavonoids attained a considerable interest in transdermal administration. The aim is to develop a systematic approach to evaluate the substructures that were favorable for flavonoid delivery into the skin and understand how these action sites interacted with lipids and bound to multidrug resistance protein 1 (MRP1) for enhanced transdermal delivery. First, we investigated the permeation properties of various flavonoids on the porcine skin or rat skin. We found that 4'-OH (hydroxyl group on the carbon 4' position) rather than 7-OH on the flavonoids was the key group for flavonoid permeation and retention, while 4'-OCH<sub>3</sub> and -CH<sub>2</sub>═CH<sub>2</sub>-CH-(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> were unfavorable for drug delivery. 4'-OH could decrease flavonoids' lipophilicity to an appropriate log <i>P</i> and polarizability for better transdermal drug delivery. In the stratum corneum, flavonoids used 4'-OH as a hand to specifically grab the C═O group of the ceramide NS (Cer), which increased the miscibility of flavonoids and Cer and then disturbed the lipid arrangement of Cer, thereby facilitating their penetration. Subsequently, we constructed overexpressed MRP1 HaCaT/MRP1 cells by permanent transfection of human MRP1 cDNA in wild HaCaT cells. In the dermis, we observed that 4'-OH, 7-OH, and 6-OCH<sub>3</sub> substructures were involved in H-bond formation within MRP1, which increased the flavonoid affinity with MRP1 and flavonoid efflux transport. Moreover, the expression of MRP1 was significantly enhanced after the treatment of flavonoids on the rat skin. Collectively, 4'-OH served as the action site for increased lipid disruption and enhanced affinity for MRP1, which facilitate the transdermal delivery of flavonoids, providing valuable guidelines for molecular modification and drug design of flavonoids.",

Osteocytes, dendritic cells that form a syncytium throughout the bone, are responsible for the mechanosensory function of bone tissue. Studies employing histology, mathematical modeling, cell culture, and ex vivo bone organ cultures have greatly advanced the understanding of osteocyte mechanobiology. However, the fundamental question of how osteocytes respond to and encode mechanical information at the molecular level in vivo is not well understood. Intracellular calcium concentration fluctuations in osteocytes offer a useful target for learning more about acute bone mechanotransduction mechanisms. Here, we report a method for studying osteocyte mechanobiology in vivo, combining a mouse strain with a fluorescently genetically encoded calcium indicator expressed in osteocytes with an in vivo loading and imaging system to directly detect osteocyte calcium levels during loading. This is achieved with a three-point bending device that can deliver well-defined mechanical loads to the third metatarsal of living mice while simultaneously monitoring fluorescently indicated calcium responses of osteocytes using two-photon microscopy. This technique allows for direct in vivo observation of osteocyte calcium signaling events in response to whole bone loading and is useful in the endeavor to reveal mechanisms in osteocyte mechanobiology.",

Photovoice methodology was used to explore parental perception of school meals in San Joaquin Valley, California, a region of predominately Latino farmworker communities. Parents in seven school districts photographed school meals for a one-week period during the pandemic and then participated in focus group discussions and small group interviews. Focus group discussions and small group interviews were transcribed, and data were analyzed using a team-based, theme-analysis approach. Three primary domains emerged: benefits of school meal distribution, meal quality and appeal, and perceived healthfulness. Parents perceived school meals as beneficial to addressing food insecurity. However, they noted that meals were unappealing, high in added sugar, and unhealthy, which led to discarded meals and decreased participation in the school meal program. The transition to grab-and-go style meals was an effective strategy for providing food to families during pandemic school closures, and school meals remain an important resource for families experiencing food insecurity. However, negative parental perceptions of the appeal and nutritional content of school meals may have decreased school meal participation and increased food waste that could persist beyond the pandemic.",

Pericytes can convert to fibroblasts under conditions of stress and have been implicated in the pathogenesis of fibrotic diseases. We hypothesized that in diabetic hearts, pericytes may convert to fibroblasts, contributing to fibrosis and to the development of diastolic dysfunction. Methods and Results Using pericyte:fibroblast dual reporter (NG2<sup>Dsred</sup> [neuron-glial antigen 2 red fluorescent protein variant]; PDGFRα<sup>EGFP</sup> [platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha enhanced green fluorescent protein]) mice in a type 2 diabetic db/db background, we found that diabetes does not significantly affect pericyte density but reduces the myocardial pericyte:fibroblast ratio. Lineage tracing using the inducible NG2<sup>CreER</sup> driver, along with reliable labeling of fibroblasts with the PDGFRα reporter system, showed no significant pericyte to fibroblast conversion in lean and db/db hearts. In addition, db/db mouse cardiac fibroblasts did not undergo myofibroblast conversion and had no significant induction of structural collagens but exhibited a matrix-preserving phenotype, associated with increased expression of antiproteases, matricellular genes, matrix cross-linking enzymes, and the fibrogenic transcription factor <i>cMyc</i>. In contrast, db/db mouse cardiac pericytes had increased expression of <i>Timp3</i>, without any changes in expression of other fibrosis-associated genes. The matrix-preserving phenotype of diabetic fibroblasts was associated with induction of genes encoding oxidative (<i>Ptgs2</i>/cycloxygenase-2, and <i>Fmo2</i>) and antioxidant proteins (<i>Hmox1</i>, <i>Sod1</i>). In vitro, high glucose partially recapitulated the in vivo changes in diabetic fibroblasts. Conclusions Diabetic fibrosis is not mediated through pericyte to fibroblast conversion but involves acquisition of a matrix-preserving fibroblast program, which is independent of myofibroblast conversion and is only partially explained by the effects of the hyperglycemic environment.",

Here we introduce a genetically encoded sensor system to detect the dissociation events of aGPCR heterodimers into their constituent N-terminal and C-terminal fragments (NTFs and CTFs, respectively). An NTF release sensor (NRS) of the neural latrophilin-type aGPCR Cirl (ADGRL)<sup>9-11</sup>, from Drosophila melanogaster, is stimulated by mechanical force. Cirl-NRS activation indicates that receptor dissociation occurs in neurons and cortex glial cells. The release of NTFs from cortex glial cells requires trans-interaction between Cirl and its ligand, the Toll-like receptor Tollo (Toll-8)<sup>12</sup>, on neural progenitor cells, whereas expressing Cirl and Tollo in cis suppresses dissociation of the aGPCR. This interaction is necessary to control the size of the neuroblast pool in the central nervous system. We conclude that receptor autoproteolysis enables non-cell-autonomous activities of aGPCRs, and that the dissociation of aGPCRs is controlled by their ligand expression profile and by mechanical force. The NRS system will be helpful in elucidating the physiological roles and signal modulators of aGPCRs, which constitute a large untapped reservoir of drug targets for cardiovascular, immune, neuropsychiatric and neoplastic diseases<sup>13</sup>.",

In this study, we have monitored ERK signaling using four commonly used translocation- and Förster resonance energy transfer-based biosensors in a common cell stimulation context. Consistent with previous reports, we found that each biosensor responds with unique kinetics; it is clear that there is not a single dynamic signature characterizing the complexity of ERK phosphorylation, translocation, and kinase activity. In particular, the widely adopted ERK Kinase Translocation Reporter (ERKKTR) gives a readout that reflects ERK activity in both compartments. Mathematical modeling offers an interpretation of the measured ERKKTR kinetics, in relation to cytosolic and nuclear ERK activity, and suggests that biosensor-specific dynamics substantially influence the measured output.",

The 14C4 units could grab water, thereby forming hydrogen bond-water networks and acting as jumping sites to lower the energy barrier of proton transport. The molecular chains present a vertical orientation to the membrane, and the ions travel between the quasi-planar molecular sheets. Furthermore, the 14C4 moieties could bond alkali ions through host-guest interactions. Thus, the ion conductance follows H<sup>+</sup> ≫K<sup>+</sup> >Na<sup>+</sup> >Li<sup>+</sup> , and an ultrahigh selectivity of H<sup>+</sup> /Li<sup>+</sup> (ca. 215) is obtained. This study provides an effective avenue for developing ion-selective membranes by embedding macrocycle motifs with inherent cavities.",

The bundle is composed of 825 multimode cores, ordered in a hexagonal lattice with a pixel size of 14 μm and a total diameter of 914 μm.

The excitation beam and fluorescent image were transferred through the fiber imaging bundle. As test samples, we used 1 μm green fluorescent latex beads, ex vivo hippocampal neurons expressing green fluorescent protein and cortical neurons in vivo expressing the fluorescent reporter GCaMP6s or immediate early gene Fos fluorescent reporter. This system can be used for minimal-invasive in vivo imaging of the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, or deep brain areas as a part of a tabletop system or an implantable setup.

PFDs should be assessed and managed by multidisciplinary teams. Our study aimed to describe clinical signs of feeding difficulties in a group of PFD patients assessed by such a team, and to compare them with children in a control group. In this case-control study, case group patients 1 to 6 years old were consecutively recruited through the multidisciplinary unit for the treatment of pediatric feeding difficulties based at Robert Debré Teaching Hospital in Paris, France. Children with an encephalopathy, severe neurometabolic disorder, or genetic syndrome (suspected or confirmed) were excluded. Members of the control group, consisting of children with no feeding difficulties (i.e., Montreal Children's Hospital Feeding Scale scores below 60) or severe chronic diseases, were recruited from a day care center and 2 kindergartens. Data from medical histories and clinical examination related to mealtime practices, oral motor skills, neurodevelopment, sensory processing, and any functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) were recorded and compared between groups. In all, 244 PFD cases were compared with 109 controls (mean ages: cases, 3.42 [±1.47]; controls, 3.32 [±1.17]; <i>P</i> = 0.55). Use of distractions during meals was much more among PFD children (cases, 77.46%; controls, 5.5%; <i>P</i> < 0.001), as was conflict during meals. While the groups did not differ in their members' hand-mouth coordination or ability to grab objects, cases began exploring their environments later; mouthing, especially, was less common in the case group (cases, <i>n</i> = 80 [32.92%]; controls, <i>n</i> = 102 [94.44%]; <i>P</i> < 0.001). FGIDs and signs of visual, olfactory, tactile, and oral hypersensitivity were significantly more frequent among cases.

One important challenge to be still solved is how UCNPs can be optimally implemented into Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) biosensing and bioimaging for highly sensitive, wash-free, multiplexed, accurate, and precise quantitative analysis of biomolecules and biomolecular interactions. The many possible UCNP architectures composed of a core and multiple shells doped with different lanthanoid ions at different ratios, the interaction with FRET acceptors at different possible distances and orientations via biomolecular interaction, and the many and long-lasting energy transfer pathways from the initial UCNP excitation to the final FRET process and acceptor emission make the experimental determination of the ideal UCNP-FRET configuration for optimal analytical performance a real challenge. To overcome this issue, we have developed a fully analytical model that requires only a few experimental configurations to determine the ideal UCNP-FRET system within a few minutes. We verified our model via experiments using nine different Nd-, Yb-, and Er-doped core-shell-shell UCNP architectures within a prototypical DNA hybridization assay using Cy3.5 as an acceptor dye. Using the selected experimental input, the model determined the optimal UCNP out of all theoretically possible combinatorial configurations. An extreme economy of time, effort, and material was accompanied by a significant sensitivity increase, which demonstrated the powerful feat of combining a few selected experiments with sophisticated but rapid modeling to accomplish an ideal FRET biosensor.",

The hawthorn spider mite, Amphitetranychus viennensis Zacher, is a major pest for rosaceous plants, which has been controlled primarily by synthetic pesticides. To address the emerging resistance issues in A. viennensis, we initiated a project to develop RNAi-based biopesticides. In this study, we (i) developed a dietary RNAi system for A. viennensis using leaf disc, (ii) assessed the suitability of multiple control genes to distinguish sequence-specific silencing from non-specific effects within this RNAi system, and (iii) screened for the target gene candidates. As a result, β-Glucuronidase (GUS), an enzyme derived from E. coli and a broadly used reporter for plants is the appropriate control for A. viennensis RNAi, while green fluorescent protein (GFP), is not suitable due to its significantly higher mortality than the other controls. For target gene screening, suppression was confirmed for all the candidates, including two housekeeping genes (Vacuolar-type H + -ATPase subunit A (V-ATPase A) and Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, (GAPDH)), and three genes associated with development (ATP-dependent RNA Helicase DDX3Y (Belle), CREB-binding protein (CBP), and Farnesoic acid O-methyltransferase (FaMet)). Knocking down of V-ATPase A resulted in the highest mortality (~ 90%) and reduced fecundity (over 90%) than other candidates. As for the genes associated with development, suppression of Belle and CBP, led to approximately 65% mortality, as well as 86% and 40% reduction in fecundity, respectively. Silencing of FaMet, however, had negligible biological impacts on A. viennensis. The combined efforts not only establish an effective dsRNA delivery method, but also provide potential target genes for RNAi-based biopesticides against A. viennensis, a devastating invasive pest for fruit trees and woody ornamental plants throughout Asia and Europe. © 2023 Society of Chemical Industry.",

        "abstract": "Chikungunya fever is a mosquito-transmitted infectious disease that induces rash, myalgia, and persistent incapacitating arthralgia. At present, no vaccines or antiviral therapies specific to Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) infection have been approved, and research is currently restricted to biosafety level 3 containment. CHIKV-like replicon particles (VRPs) are single-cycle infectious particles containing viral structure proteins, as well as a defective genome to provide a safe surrogate for living CHIKV to facilitate the testing of vaccines and antivirals. However, inefficient RNA transfection and the potential emergence of the competent virus through recombination in mammalian cells limit VRP usability. This study describes a transfection-free system for the safe packaging of CHIK VRP with all necessary components via transduction of mosquito cell lines using a single baculovirus vector. We observed the release of substantial quantities of mosquito cell-derived CHIK VRP (mos-CHIK VRP) from baculovirus-transduced mosquito cell lines. The VRPs were shown to recapitulate viral replication and subgenomic dual reporter expression (enhanced green fluorescent protein [eGFP] and luciferase) in infected host cells. Interestingly, the rapid expression kinetics of the VRP-expressing luciferase reporter (6 h) makes it possible to use mos-CHIK VRPs for the rapid quantification of VRP infection. Treatment with antivirals (suramin or 6-azauridine) or neutralizing antibodies (monoclonal antibodies [MAbs] or patient sera) was shown to inhibit mos-CHIK VRP infection in a dose-dependent manner. Ease of manufacture, safety, scalability, and high throughput make mos-CHIK VRPs a highly valuable vehicle for the study of CHIKV biology, the detection of neutralizing (NT) antibody activity, and the screening of antivirals against CHIKV. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> This study proposes a transfection-free system that enables the safe packaging of CHIK VRPs with all necessary components via baculovirus transduction. Those mosquito cell-derived CHIK VRP (mos-CHIK VRPs) were shown to recapitulate viral replication and subgenomic dual reporter (enhanced green fluorescent protein [eGFP] and luciferase) expression in infected host cells. Rapid expression kinetics of the VRP-expressing luciferase reporter (within hours) opens the door to using mos-CHIK VRPs for the rapid quantification of neutralizing antibody and antiviral activity against CHIKV. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to report a mosquito cell-derived alphavirus VRP system. Note that this system could also be applied to other arboviruses to model the earliest event in arboviral infection in vertebrates.",

At the polymer/pDNA ratio of 5.0, the ζ-potentials of the complexes were negative (-6.55 to -10.6 mV) unlike the complexes with the native PEI (+11.2 mV). The transfection experiments indicated that the prepared lipopolymers showed higher transfection in attachment-dependent cells than in suspension cells based on the expression of the reporter green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene. When loaded with Cy3-labeled pDNA, the lipopolymers exhibited effective cellular uptake in attachment-dependent cells while the cellular uptake was limited in suspension cells.

In this system, RM B cells are activated with CD40 ligand and RM IL-21 before transduction with a retroviral vector encoding Bcl-6, Bcl-xL, and green fluorescent protein. Importantly, RM B cells from lymph nodes are more effectively immortalized by this method than B cells from PBMC, a difference not seen in humans. We suggest the discrepancy between these two tissues is due to increased expression of CD40 on RM lymph node B cells. Immortalized RM B cells expand long-term, undergo minimal somatic hypermutation, express surface B cell receptor, and secrete antibodies into culture. This allows for the identification of cells based on antigen specificity and/or functional assays. Here, we show the characterization of this system and its application for the isolation of HIV-1 neutralizing antibodies from a SHIV.CH505-infected animal, both with and without antigen probe.

The number of neurons producing Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients as well as the amplitude of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients indicates sensitivity to specific sensory modalities.

Although it is well-documented that better-than-expected outcomes are encoded quantitatively via midbrain dopaminergic (DA) activity, it has been less addressed experimentally whether worse-than-expected outcomes are expressed quantitatively as well. We show that larger reward expectations upon unexpected reward omissions are associated with the preceding slower rise and following larger decrease (DA dip) in the DA concentration at the ventral striatum of mice. We set up a lever press task on a fixed ratio (FR) schedule requiring five lever presses as an effort for a food reward (FR5). The mice occasionally checked the food magazine without a reward before completing the task. The percentage of this premature magazine entry (PME) increased as the number of lever presses approached five, showing rising expectations with increasing proximity to task completion, and hence greater reward expectations. Fibre photometry of extracellular DA dynamics in the ventral striatum using a fluorescent protein (genetically encoded GPCR activation-based DA sensor: GRAB<sub>DA2m</sub> ) revealed that the slow increase and fast decrease in DA levels around PMEs were correlated with the PME percentage, demonstrating a monotonic relationship between the DA dip amplitude and degree of expectations. Computational modelling of the lever press task implementing temporal difference errors and state transitions replicated the observed correlation between the PME frequency and DA dip amplitude in the FR5 task. Taken together, these findings indicate that the DA dip amplitude represents the degree of reward expectations monotonically, which may guide behavioural adjustment.",

The mean DA was 164.8° ± 4.0 in the PFCL-assisted group and 119.7° ± 8.7 in the standard group, with a statistically significant difference between groups (<i>p</i> < 0.001). Moreover, we found a significant difference in the amount of ERM grabs between the two groups (7.2 ± 2.5 in the PFCL-assisted group vs. 10.3 ± 3.1 in the standard group, <i>p</i> = 0.005). The mean BCVA and metamorphopsia significantly improved in both groups (<i>p</i> < 0.05), with no significant intergroup difference at all follow-up visits. Similarly, CST significantly decreased in both groups, and final CST was similar between the two groups (<i>p</i> = 0.719). Overall, three eyes in the standard group developed postoperative dissociated optic nerve fiber layer (DONFL, 16.6%), compared to none of the PFCL-assisted group. We reported a statistically significant difference in the intraoperative peeling dynamics of the PFCL-assisted group, accounting for a decreased tendency in the tearing of the ERM flap and possibly reduced damage to the fiber layer, with equal effectiveness in improving visual function and foveal thickness.",

The role of calcium transients in salinity stress signaling is well established, but the physiological significance of concurrent salinity-induced changes in cytosolic pH remains largely undefined. Here, we analyzed the response of Arabidopsis roots expressing the genetically encoded ratiometric pH-sensor pHGFP fused to marker proteins for the recruitment of the sensor to the cytosolic side of the tonoplast (pHGFP-VTI11) and the plasma membrane (pHGFP-LTI6b). Salinity elicited a rapid alkalinization of cytosolic pH (pHcyt) in the meristematic and elongation zone of wild-type roots. The pH-shift near the plasma membrane preceded that at the tonoplast. In pH-maps transversal to the root axis, the epidermis and cortex had cells with a more alkaline pHcyt relative to cells in the stele in control conditions. Conversely, seedlings treated with 100 mM NaCl exhibited an increased pHcyt in cells of the vasculature relative to the external layers of the root, and this response occurred in both reporter lines. These pHcyt changes were substantially reduced in mutant roots lacking a functional SOS3/CBL4 protein, suggesting that the operation of the SOS pathway mediated the dynamics of pHcyt in response to salinity.",

The present study addresses the interaction of RIPK1 and FADD in TNFα signaling by fusion of C-terminal (CLuc) and N-terminal (NLuc) luciferase fragments to RIPK1-CLuc (R1C) or FADD-NLuc (FN) in a caspase 8 negative neuroblastic SH-SY5Y cell line, respectively. In addition, based on our findings, an RIPK1 mutant (R1C K612R) had less interaction with FN, resulting in increasing cell viability. Moreover, presence of a caspase inhibitor (zVAD.fmk) increases luciferase activity compared to Smac mimetic BV6 (B), TNFα -induced (T) and non-induced cell. Furthermore, etoposide decreased luciferase activity, but dexamethasone was not effective in SH-SY5Y. This reporter assay might be used to evaluate basic aspects of this interaction as well as for screening of necroptosis and apoptosis targeting drugs with potential therapeutic application.",

Several types of fluorescent protein-stabilized gold nanoclusters (protein-AuNCs) have been developed for sensitive and easy detection of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. However, its low sensitivity makes is difficult to measure negligible concentrations of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Therefore, to overcome this limitation, we developed a horseradish peroxidase-encapsulated fluorescent bio-nanoparticle (HEFBNP), comprising bovine serum albumin-stabilized gold nanoclusters (BSA-AuNCs) and horseradish peroxidase-stabilized gold nanoclusters (HRP-AuNCs). The fabricated HEFBNP can sensitively detect H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> owing to its two properties. The first is that HEFBNPs have a continuous two-step fluorescence quenching mechanism, which comes from the heterogenous fluorescence quenching mechanism of HRP-AuNCs and BSA-AuNCs. Second, the proximity of two protein-AuNCs in a single HEFBNP allows a reaction intermediate (•OH) to rapidly reach the adjacent protein-AuNCs. As a result, HEFBNP can improve the overall reaction event and decrease the loss of intermediate in the solution. Due to the continuous quenching mechanism and effective reaction event, a HEFBNP-based sensing system can measure very low concentrations of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> up to 0.5 nM and show good selectivity. Furthermore, we design a glass-based microfluidic device to make it easier use HEFBNP, which allowed us to detect H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> with the naked eye.

Measuring the free cellular calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) concentrations <i>in vivo</i> with genetically encodable FPs can be a relatively direct measure of neuronal activity due to the complex signaling role of these ions. REX-GECO1 is a recently developed red-green emission and excitation ratiometric FP-based biosensor that achieves a high dynamic range due to differences in the chromophore response to light excitation with and without calcium ions. Using steady-state electronic measurements (UV/Visible absorption and emission), along with time-resolved spectroscopic techniques including femtosecond transient absorption (fs-TA) and femtosecond stimulated Raman spectroscopy (FSRS), the potential energy surfaces of these unique biosensors are unveiled with vivid details. The ground-state structural characterization of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free biosensor via FSRS reveals a more spacious protein pocket that allows the chromophore to efficiently twist and reach a dark state. In contrast, the more compressed cavity within the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-bound biosensor results in a more heterogeneous distribution of chromophore populations that results in multi-step excited state proton transfer (ESPT) pathways on the sub-140 fs, 600 fs, and 3 ps timescales. These results enable rational design strategies to enlarge the spectral separation between the protonated/deprotonated forms and the Stokes shift leading to a larger dynamic range and potentially higher fluorescence quantum yield, which should be broadly applicable to the calcium imaging and biosensor communities.",

By using the enhanced green fluorescent protein reporter plasmid pGNtsf1, we demonstrate that pCas9-U6sgRNA driven by endogenous U6 promoter (pCas9-mU6sgRNA) mediated very high gene editing efficiency in medaka cultured cells, but not by exogenous U6 promoters. After optimizing the conditions, the gene editing efficiencies of eight sites targeting for four endogenous genes were calculated, and the highest was up to 94% with no detectable off-target. By one-cell embryo microinjection, pCas9-mU6sgRNA also mediated efficient gene knock-out in vivo. Furthermore, pCas9-mU6sgRNA efficiently mediated gene knock-in at a specific site in medaka cultured cells as well as embryos. Collectively, our study demonstrates that the genetic relationship of U6 promoter is critical to gene editing efficiency in medaka cultured cells, and a simple and efficient system for medaka genome editing in vitro and in vivo has been established.

Integrating brain and behavioral evidence, we discuss how probabilistic (varied outcomes) and temporal (delayed outcomes) uncertainty differ across age and individuals; how critical tests adjudicate between theories of uncertainty (prospect theory and fuzzy-trace theory); and how these mechanisms might be represented in the brain. The same categorical gist representations of gains and losses account for choices and eye-tracking data in both value-allocation (add money to gambles) and risky-choice tasks, disconfirming prospect theory and confirming predictions of fuzzy-trace theory. The analysis is extended to delay discounting and disambiguated choices, explaining hidden-zero effects that similarly turn on categorical distinctions between some gain and no gain, certain gain and uncertain gain, gain and loss, and now and later. Bold activation implicates dorsolateral prefrontal and posterior parietal cortices in gist strategies that are not just one tool in a grab-bag of cognitive options but rather are general strategies that systematically predict behaviors across many different tasks involving probabilistic and temporal uncertainty. High valuation (e.g., ventral striatum; ventromedial prefrontal cortex) and low executive control (e.g., lateral prefrontal cortex) contribute to risky and impatient choices, especially in youth. However, valuation in ventral striatum supports reward-maximizing and gist strategies in adulthood. Indeed, processing becomes less \"rational\" in the sense of maximizing gains and more noncompensatory (eye movements indicate fewer tradeoffs) as development progresses from adolescence to adulthood, as predicted. Implications for theoretically predicted \"public-health paradoxes\" are discussed, including gist versus verbatim thinking in drug experimentation and addiction.",

Using a newly generated line of transgenic rats (OTR-IRES-Cre), we determined that most of the vlPAG OTR expressing cells targeted by OT projections are GABAergic. Ex vivo stimulation of parvocellular OT axons in the vlPAG induced local OT release, as measured with OT sensor GRAB. In vivo, optogenetically-evoked axonal OT release in the vlPAG of as well as chemogenetic activation of OTR vlPAG neurons resulted in a long-lasting increase of vlPAG neuronal activity. This lead to an indirect suppression of sensory neuron activity in the spinal cord and strong analgesia in both female and male rats.

        "abstract": "Many Gram-negative pathogens rely on type IV secretion systems (T4SS) for infection. One limitation has been the lack of ideal reporters to identify T4SS translocated effectors and study T4SS function. Most reporter systems make use of fusions to reporter proteins, in particular, β-lactamase (TEM) and calmodulin-dependent adenylate cyclase (CYA), that allow detection of translocated enzymatic activity inside host cells. However, both systems require costly reagents and use complex, multistep procedures for loading host cells with substrate (TEM) or for analysis (CYA). Therefore, we have developed and characterized a novel reporter system using nanoluciferase (NLuc) fusions to address these limitations. Serendipitously, we discovered that Nluc itself is efficiently translocated by Legionella pneumophila T4SS in an IcmSW chaperone-dependent manner via an N-terminal translocation signal. Extensive mutagenesis in the NLuc N terminus suggested the importance of an α-helical domain spanning D5 to V9, as mutations predicted to disrupt this structure, with one exception, were translocation defective. Notably, NLuc was capable of translocating several proteins examined when fused to the N or C terminus, while maintaining robust luciferase activity. In particular, it delivered the split GFP11 fragment into J774 macrophages transfected with GFPopt, thereby resulting in <i>in vivo</i> assembly of superfolder green fluorescent protein (GFP). This provided a bifunctional assay in which translocation could be assayed by fluorescence microplate, confocal microscopy, and/or luciferase assays. We further identified an optimal NLuc substrate which allowed a robust, inexpensive, one-step, high-throughput screening assay to identify T4SS translocation substrates and inhibitors. Taken together, these results indicate that NLuc provides both new insight into and also tools for studying T4SS biology. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Type IV secretion systems (T4SS) are used by Gram-negative pathogens to coopt host cell function. However, the translocation signals recognized by T4SS are not fully explained by primary amino acid sequence, suggesting yet-to-be-defined contributions of secondary and tertiary structure. Here, we unexpectedly identified nanoluciferase (NLuc) as an efficient IcmSW-dependent translocated T4SS substrate, and we provide extensive mutagenesis data suggesting that the first N-terminal, alpha-helix domain is a critical translocation recognition motif. Notably, most existing reporter systems for studying translocated proteins make use of fusions to reporters to permit detection of translocated enzymatic activity inside the host cell. However, existing systems require extremely costly substrates, complex technical procedures to isolate eukaryotic cytoplasm for analysis, and/or are insensitive. Importantly, we found that NLuc provides a powerful, cost-effective new tool to address these limitations and facilitate high-throughput exploration of secretion system biology.",

        "abstract": "Although several mechanisms of macroautophagy/autophagy have been dissected in the last decade, following this pathway in real time remains challenging. Among the early events leading to its activation, the ATG4B protease primes the key autophagy player MAP1LC3B/LC3B. Given the lack of reporters to follow this event in living cells, we developed a Förster's resonance energy transfer (FRET) biosensor responding to the priming of LC3B by ATG4B. The biosensor was generated by flanking LC3B within a pH-resistant donor-acceptor FRET pair, Aquamarine-tdLanYFP. We here showed that the biosensor has a dual readout. First, FRET indicates the priming of LC3B by ATG4B and the resolution of the FRET image makes it possible to characterize the spatial heterogeneity of the priming activity. Second, quantifying the number of Aquamarine-LC3B puncta determines the degree of autophagy activation. We then showed that there are pools of unprimed LC3B upon <i>ATG4B</i> downregulation, and the priming of the biosensor is abolished in <i>ATG4B</i> knockout cells. The lack of priming can be rescued with the wild-type ATG4B or with the partially active W142A mutant, but not with the catalytically dead C74S mutant. Moreover, we screened for commercially-available ATG4B inhibitors, and illustrated their differential mode of action by implementing a spatially-resolved, broad-to-sensitive analysis pipeline combining FRET and the quantification of autophagic puncta. Finally, we uncovered the CDK1-dependent regulation of the ATG4B-LC3B axis at mitosis. Therefore, the LC3B FRET biosensor paves the way for a highly-quantitative monitoring of the ATG4B activity in living cells and in real time, with unprecedented spatiotemporal resolution.<b>Abbreviations:</b> Aqua: aquamarine; ATG: autophagy related; AURKA: aurora kinase A; BafA<sub>1</sub>: bafilomycin A<sub>1</sub>; CDK1: cyclin dependent kinase 1; DKO: double knockout; FLIM: fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy; FP: fluorescence protein; FRET: Förster's resonance energy transfer; GABARAP: GABA type A receptor-associated protein; HBSS: Hanks' balanced salt solution; KO: knockout; LAMP2: lysosomal associated membrane protein 2; MAP1LC3/LC3: microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3; NSC: NSC 185058; PE: phosphatidylethanolamine; SKO: single knockout; TKO: triple knockout; ULK1: unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase 1; WT: wild-type; ZPCK: <i>Z-L</i>-phe chloromethyl ketone.",

Eighty intact, crack-free third molars with standard MOD cavities were included in this in vitro study and randomly divided into four groups of 20 each. After adhesive treatment, the cavities were restored either with bulk (group 1) or layered (group 2) short-fiber-reinforced resin composites (SFRC); bulk-fill RC (group 3); and layered conventional RC (control). Right after the polymerization and a week later, crack evaluation on the outer surface of the remaining cavity walls was performed with a transillumination method utilizing the D-Light Pro (GC Europe) with the \"detection mode.\" Between- and within-groups comparisons Kruskal-Wallis and Wilcoxon tests were used, respectively. Post-polymerization crack evaluation showed significantly lower crack formation in SFRC groups compared to the control (p<0.001). There was no significant difference within SFRC groups and non-SFRC groups (p=1.00 and p=0.11, respectively). Within group comparison revealed significantly higher number of cracks in all groups after 1 week (p≤0.001), however, only the control group differed significantly from all the other groups (p≤0.003). Post-polymerization shrinkage induced further crack formation in the tooth 1 week after the restoration. SFRC was less prone to shrinkage-related crack formation during the restorative procedure; however, after 1 week, besides SFRC, bulk-fill RC also showed less prone to polymerization shrinkage-related crack formation than layered composite fillings. SRFC can decrease the shrinkage stress-induced crack formation in MOD cavities.",

The functions of enteroendocrine cells have classically been inferred by the gut hormones they release.

Here, we developed approaches involving intersectional genetics to enable selective access to enteroendocrine cells in vivo in mice. We targeted FlpO expression to the endogenous <i>Villin1</i> locus (in <i>Vil1-p2a-FlpO</i> knock-in mice) to restrict reporter expression to intestinal epithelium. Combined use of Cre and Flp alleles effectively targeted major transcriptome-defined enteroendocrine cell lineages that produce serotonin, glucagon-like peptide 1, cholecystokinin, somatostatin, or glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide. Chemogenetic activation of different enteroendocrine cell types variably impacted feeding behavior and gut motility.

        "abstract": "AMB-FUBINACA is a synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonist (SCRA), which has been associated with substantial abuse and health harm since 2016 in many countries including New Zealand. A characteristic of AMB-FUBINACA use in New Zealand has included the observation that forensic samples (from autopsies) and drugs seized by police have often been found to contain para-fluorophenylpiperazine (pFPP), a relatively little-characterised piperazine analogue that has been suggested to act through 5HT1a serotonin receptors. In the current study, we aimed to characterise the interactions of these two agents in rat physiological endpoints using plethysmography and telemetry, and to examine whether pFPP altered the subjective effects of AMB-FUBINACA in mice trained to differentiate a cannabinoid (THC) from vehicle. Though pFPP did not alter the ability of AMB-FUBINACA to substitute for THC, it did appear to abate some of the physiological effects of AMB-FUBINACA in rats by delaying the onset of AMB-FUBINACA-mediated hypothermia and shortening duration of bradycardia. In HEK cells stably expressing the CB1 cannabinoid receptor, 5HT1a, or both CB1 and 5HT1a, cAMP signalling was recorded using a BRET biosensor (CAMYEL) to assess possible direct receptor interactions. Although low potency pFPP agonism at 5HT1a was confirmed, little evidence for signalling interactions was detected in these assays: additive or synergistic effects on potency or efficacy were not detected between pFPP and AMB-FUBINACA-mediated cAMP inhibition. Experiments utilising higher potency, classical 5HT1a ligands (agonist 8OH-DPAT and antagonist WAY100635) also failed to reveal evidence for mutual CB1/5HT1a interactions or cross-antagonism. Finally, the ability of pFPP to alter the metabolism of AMB-FUBINACA in rat and human liver microsomes into its primary carboxylic acid metabolite via carboxylesterase-1 was assessed by HPLC; no inhibition was detected. Overall, the effects we have observed do not suggest that increased harm/toxicity would result from the combination of pFPP and AMB-FUBINACA.",

        "abstract": "Sediment fingerprinting is used to identify catchment sediment sources. Traditionally, it has been based on the collection and analysis of potential soil sources and target sediment. Differences between soil source properties (i.e., fingerprints) are then used to discriminate between sources, allowing the quantification of the relative source contributions to the target sediment. The traditional approach generally requires substantial resources for sampling and fingerprint analysis, when using conventional laboratory procedures. In pursuit of reducing the resources required, several new fingerprints have been tested and applied. However, despite the lower resource demands for analysis, most recently proposed fingerprints still require resource intensive sampling and laboratory analysis. Against this background, this study describes the use of UV-VIS absorbance spectra for sediment fingerprinting, which can be directly measured by submersible spectrophotometers on water samples in a rapid and non-destructive manner. To test the use of absorbance to estimate spatial source contributions to the target suspended sediment (SS), water samples were collected from a series of confluences during three sampling campaigns in which a confluence-based approach to source fingerprinting was undertaken. Water samples were measured in the laboratory and, after compensation for absorbance influenced by dissolved components and SS concentration, absorbance readings were used in combination with the MixSIAR Bayesian mixing model to quantify spatial source contributions. The contributions were compared with the sediment budget, to evaluate the potential use of absorbance for sediment fingerprinting at catchment scale. Overall deviations between the spatial source contributions using source fingerprinting and sediment budgeting were 18 % for all confluences (n = 11), for all events (n = 3). However, some confluences showed much higher deviations (up to 52 %), indicating the need for careful evaluation of the results using the spectrophotometer probe. Overall, this study shows the potential of using absorbance, directly obtained from grab water samples, for sediment fingerprinting in natural environments.",

Drug self-administration and ICSS yield concordant metrics of abuse potential across a diverse range of drug mechanisms of action. The \"rate of onset,\" defined as the velocity with which a drug produces its effect once administered, has also been implicated as a determinant of abuse-related drug effects in self-administration procedures, but this variable has not been systematically examined in ICSS. Accordingly, this study compared ICSS effects produced in rats by three DA transporter inhibitors that have different rates of onset (fastest to slowest: cocaine, WIN-35428, RTI-31) and that produced progressively weaker metrics of abuse potential in a drug self-administration procedure in rhesus monkeys. Additionally, in vivo photometry using the fluorescent DA sensor dLight1.1 targeted to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) was used to assess the time course of extracellular DA levels as a neurochemical correlate of behavioral effects. All three compounds produced ICSS facilitation and increased DA levels assessed by dLight. In both procedures, the rank order of onset rate was cocaine > WIN-35428 > RTI-31; however, in contrast to monkey drug self-administration results, maximum effects did not differ across compounds. These results provide additional evidence that drug-induced increases in DA drive ICSS facilitation in rats and illustrate the utility of both ICSS and photometry to evaluate the time course and magnitude of abuse-related drug effects in rats.",

In this study, we attempted genome editing using CRISPR/Cas9 (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR associated protein 9) system using this protein introduction technique. As an experimental system to evaluate genome editing, we utilized transgenic reporter plants carrying the reporter genes L-(I-SceI)-UC and sGFP-waxy-HPT. The L-(I-SceI)-UC system allowed the detection of successful genome editing by measuring the chemiluminescent signal observed upon re-functionalization of the luciferase (LUC) gene following genome editing. Similarly, the sGFP-waxy-HPT system conferred hygromycin resistance caused by hygromycin phosphotransferase (HPT) during genome editing. CRISPR/Cas9 ribonucleoproteins targeting these reporter genes were directly introduced into rice calli or tobacco leaf pieces after treatment with N2 and/or CO2 plasma. Cultivation of the treated rice calli on a suitable medium plate produced the luminescence signal, which was not observed in the negative control. Four types of genome-edited sequences were obtained upon sequencing the reporter genes of genome-edited candidate calli. sGFP-waxy-HPT-carrying tobacco cells exhibited hygromycin resistance during genome editing. After repeated cultivation of the treated tobacco leaf pieces on a regeneration medium plate, the calli were observed with leaf pieces. A green callus that was hygromycin-resistant was harvested, and a genome-edited sequence in the tobacco reporter gene was confirmed. As direct introduction of the Cas9/sgRNA (single guide RNA) complex using plasma enables genome editing in plants without any DNA introduction, this method is expected to be optimized for many plant species and may be widely applied for plant breeding in the future.",

These computations are performed by distinct types of neurons interconnected in circuits dedicated to the specialized roles of the auditory system. In the present study, we explored the use of voltage imaging to investigate CN circuitry. We tested two approaches based on fundamentally different voltage sensing technologies. Using a voltage-sensitive dye we recorded glutamate receptor-independent signals arising predominantly from axons. The mean conduction velocity of these fibers of 0.27 m/s was rapid but in range with other unmyelinated axons. We then used a genetically-encoded hybrid voltage sensor (hVOS) to image voltage from a specific population of neurons. Probe expression was controlled using Cre recombinase linked to <i>c-fos</i> activation. This activity-induced gene enabled targeting of neurons that are activated when a mouse hears a pure 15-kHz tone. In CN slices from these animals auditory nerve fiber stimulation elicited a glutamate receptor-dependent depolarization in hVOS probe-labeled neurons. These cells resided within a band corresponding to an isofrequency lamina, and responded with a high degree of synchrony. In contrast to the axonal origin of voltage-sensitive dye signals, hVOS signals represent predominantly postsynaptic responses. The introduction of voltage imaging to the CN creates the opportunity to investigate auditory processing circuitry in populations of neurons targeted on the basis of their genetic identity and their roles in sensory processing.",

        "abstract": "The formation of hyphae is a key virulence attribute of Candida albicans as they are required for adhesion to and invasion of host cells, and ultimately deep-tissue dissemination. Hyphae also secrete the peptide toxin candidalysin, which is crucial for destruction of host cell membranes. The peptide is derived from a precursor protein encoded by the gene <i>ECE1</i> which is strongly induced during hyphal growth. Previous studies revealed a very complex regulation of this gene involving several transcription factors. However, the promoter of the gene is still not characterized. Here, we present a functional analysis of the intergenic region upstream of the <i>ECE1</i> gene. Rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE)-PCR was performed to identify the 5' untranslated region, which has a size of 49 bp regardless of the hyphae-inducing condition. By using green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter constructs we further defined a minimal promoter length of 1,500 bp which was verified by RT-qPCR. Finally, we identified the TATA element required for the expression of the gene. It is located 106 to 109 bp upstream of the <i>ECE1</i> start codon. Our results illustrate that despite a very short 5' UTR, a relatively long promoter is required to secure <i>ECE1</i> transcription, indicating a complex regulatory machinery tightly controlling the expression of the gene. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> In recent years it was shown that secretion of the toxic peptide candidalysin from hyphae of the major human fungal pathogen Candida albicans contributes heavily to its virulence. The peptide is derived from a precursor protein which is encoded by the <i>ECE1</i> gene whose transcription is known to be closely associated with formation of hyphae. Here, we used a GFP reporter system to determine the length of the <i>ECE1</i> promoter and were able to show that it has a minimal size of 1,500 bp. Surprisingly, the gene has a very short 5' UTR of only 49 bp. In accordance with this, the TATA element required for transcription is located 106 to 109 bp upstream of the start codon. This indicates that <i>ECE1</i> expression is controlled by a very long promoter allowing a complex network of transcription factors to contribute to the gene's regulation.",

In addition, we determined that 0.156 mM LA was the limit of LA detection in <i>P. putida</i> KT2440 harboring an LA-responsive biosensor. The maximal fluorescence increase was 12.3-fold in the presence of 10 mM LA compared to that in the absence of LA.

Predominantly, rearrangements around the A'α helix interface (CNF31 and CNF35) precede FMN-cysteinyl adduct scission, folding of α-helices (amide bands), and relaxation of residue CNF151. This study illustrates the importance of characterizing all parts of a protein and suggests a key role for the N-terminal A'α extension of the LOV domain in controlling EL222 photocycle length.",

The caddisfly studies in this area increased during the past years, although insufficiently investigated areas still remain. In this paper, we describe a new species, <i>Potamophylaxhumoinsapiens</i> sp. n. from the Sharr Mountains in the Republic of Kosovo, which is morphologically closest to <i>Potamophylaxidliri</i> Ibrahimi, Bilalli & Kučinić, 2022 and <i>Potamophylaxjuliani</i> Kumanski, 1999. The males of the new species differ from all known species of the <i>Potamophylaxwinneguthi</i> Species Group by their uniquely-shaped parameres, which are long, bulbous in their basal half and thin in the remaining length, with a bunch of very thin and long, hair-like spines, grouped uniformly at the apex. The new species further differs from its most similar congeners by its very wide distance between the dorsal and ventral edges of the apical part of inferior appendages in lateral view. The new species was found at three localities from 1416 to 1505 m a.s.l.Similar to the other species of the <i>Potamophylaxwinneguthi</i> Species Group, which have very narrow distribution areas, we posit that <i>Potamophylaxhumoinsapiens</i> sp. n. is a microendemic of the Sharr Mountains. The new species is the second known caddisfly species occurring only in the Kosovan part of the Sharr Mountains.",

To date, the role of the scavenger receptor CD36 in TLRs modulation, particularly TLR2 signaling, has been well established in adult brain. However, the crosstalk between TLR4, TLR2 and CD36 and its immunogenic influence in the neonatal brain remains unclear. In this study, using a CD36 blocking antibody (anti-CD36) at post-natal day 8, we evaluated the response of neonates to systemic endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide; LPS) challenge. We visualized the TLR2 response by bioluminescence imaging using the transgenic mouse model bearing the dual reporter system luciferase/green fluorescent protein under transcriptional control of a murine TLR2 promoter. The anti-CD36 treatment modified the LPS induced inflammatory profile in neonatal brains, causing a significant decrease in inflammatory cytokine levels and the TLR2 and TLR3 mediated signalling.The interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) pathway remained unaffected. Treatment of the LPS-challenged human immature microglia with anti-CD36 induced a marked decrease in TLR2/TLR3 expression levels while TLR4 and IRF3 expression was not affected, suggesting the shared CD36 regulatory mechanisms in human and mouse microglia. Collectively, our results indicate that blocking CD36 alters LPS-induced inflammatory profile of mouse and human microglia, suggesting its role in fine-tuning of neuroinflammation.",

To determine whether loss of presynaptic CDKL5 function contributes to CDD, we examined synaptic vesicle (SV) recycling in primary hippocampal neurons generated from <i>Cdkl5</i> knockout rat males. Using a genetically encoded reporter, we revealed that CDKL5 is selectively required for efficient SV endocytosis. We showed that CDKL5 kinase activity is both necessary and sufficient for optimal SV endocytosis, since kinase-inactive mutations failed to correct endocytosis in <i>Cdkl5</i> knockout neurons, whereas the isolated CDKL5 kinase domain fully restored SV endocytosis kinetics. Finally, we demonstrated that CDKL5-mediated phosphorylation of amphiphysin 1, a putative presynaptic target, is not required for CDKL5-dependent control of SV endocytosis. Overall, our findings reveal a key presynaptic role for CDKL5 kinase activity and enhance our insight into how its dysfunction may culminate in CDD.<b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Loss of cyclin-dependent kinase like 5 (CDKL5) function is a leading cause of monogenic childhood epileptic encephalopathy. However, information regarding its biological role is scarce. In this study, we reveal a selective presynaptic role for CDKL5 in synaptic vesicle endocytosis and that its protein kinase activity is both necessary and sufficient for this role. The isolated protein kinase domain is sufficient to correct this loss of function, which may facilitate future gene therapy strategies if presynaptic dysfunction is proven to be central to the disorder. It also reveals that a CDKL5-specific substrate is located at the presynapse, the phosphorylation of which is required for optimal SV endocytosis.",

        "abstract": "Following agricultural application, pesticides can enter streams through runoff during rain events. However, little information is available on the temporal dynamics of pesticide toxicity during the main application period. We investigated pesticide application and large scale in-stream monitoring data from 101 agricultural catchments obtained from a Germany-wide monitoring from April to July in 2018 and 2019. We analysed temporal patterns of pesticide application, in-stream toxicity and exceedances of regulatory acceptable concentrations (RAC) for over 70 pesticides. On a monthly scale from April to July, toxicity to invertebrates and algae/aquatic plants (algae) obtained with event-driven samples (EDS) was highest in May/June. The peak of toxicity towards invertebrates and algae coincided with the peaks of insecticide and herbicide application. Future monitoring, i.e. related to the Water Framework Directive, could be limited to time periods of highest pesticide applications on a seasonal scale. On a daily scale, toxicity to invertebrates from EDS exceeded those of grab samples collected within one day after rainfall by a factor of 3.7. Within two to three days, toxicity in grab samples declined compared to EDS by a factor of ten for invertebrates, and a factor of 1.6 for algae. Thus, toxicity to invertebrates declined rapidly within 1 day after a rainfall event, whereas toxicity to algae remained elevated for up to 4 days. For six pesticides, RAC exceedances could only be detected in EDS. The exceedances of RACs coincided with the peaks in pesticide application. Based on EDS, we estimated that pesticide exposure would need a 37-fold reduction of all analysed pesticides, to meet the German environmental target to keep RAC exceedances below 1 % of EDS. Overall, our study shows a high temporal variability of exposure on a monthly but also daily scale to individual pesticides that can be linked to their period of application and related rain events.",

        "abstract": "Transgenes with genomic DNA fragments that encompass genes of interest are the gold standard for complementing null alleles in rescue experiments in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. Of particular interest are genomic DNA clones available as bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) or fosmids from publicly available genomic DNA libraries. Genes contained within BAC and fosmid clones can be easily modified by recombineering cloning to insert peptide or protein tags to localize, visualize, or manipulate gene products, and to create point mutations or deletions for structure-function analysis of the inserted genes. However, since transgenesis efficiency is inversely correlated with transgene size, obtaining transgenic animals for increasingly larger BAC and fosmid clones requires increasingly laborious screening efforts using the transgenesis marker commonly used for these transgenes, the dominant eye color marker white<sup>+</sup> . We recently described a drug-based selectable genetic platform for Drosophila melanogaster, which included four resistance markers that allow direct selection of transgenic animals, eliminating the need to identify transgenic progeny by laborious phenotypic screening. By integrating these resistance markers into BAC transgenes, we were able to isolate animals containing large transgenes by direct selection, avoiding laborious screening. Here we present procedures on how to upgrade BAC clones by serial recombineering cloning to build both selectable and tagged BAC transgenes, for selection transgenesis and functional gene analysis, respectively. We illustrate these procedures using a BAC clone encompassing the gene encoding the synaptic vesicle protein, cysteine string protein. We demonstrate that the modified BAC clone, serially recombineered with a selectable marker for selection transgenesis and an N-terminal green fluorescent protein tag for gene expression analysis, is functional by showing the expression pattern obtained after successful selection transgenesis. The protocols cover: (1) cloning and preparation of the recombineering templates needed for serial recombineering cloning to incorporate selectable markers and protein tags; (2) preparing electrocompetent cells needed to perform serial recombineering cloning; and (3) the serial recombineering workflow to generate both selectable and tagged genomic BAC reporter transgenes for selection transgenesis and functional gene analysis in Drosophila melanogaster. The protocols we describe can be easily adapted to incorporate any of four selectable markers, protein tags, or any other modification for structure-function analysis of the genes present within any of the BAC or fosmid clones.

Since promoters of different strengths have been demonstrated as an efficient strategy to fine-tune gene expression in synthetic biology, a set of constitutive promoters with strengths varying over 2 orders of magnitude were identified in R. toruloides through transcriptome analysis under different growth conditions. Promoter candidates were first cloned and characterized using an enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) as a reporter under eight conditions, and 31 promoters were identified with strength varied from 0.1 to 19.0 folds of the commonly used strong promoter of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene (P<sub>GPD1</sub>). The resultant promoters were then used to optimize the linoleic acid biosynthetic pathway in R. toruloides in different media, including the use of lignocellulosic hydrolysate as the fermentation substrate, and improved the production of linoleic acid by up to 214.2% in minimal medium, with the highest production of 350.3 mg/L in Yeast Peptone Dextrose medium.

Neurovascular responses were measured using a genetic calcium sensor expressed in neurons and microangiography with two-photon microscopy, while neural acivity was modulated by stimulation of contralateral whiskers or by a seizure evoked by kainic acid. For whisker stimulation, 84% of the capillary sites showed no detectable diameter change. The remaining 10% and 6% were dilated and constricted, respectively. Significant differences were observed for capillaries in the diameter at rest between the locations of dilation and constriction. Even the seizures resulted in 44% of the capillaries having no detectable change in diameter, while 56% of the capillaries dilated. The extent of dilation was dependent on the diameter at rest. In conclusion, big data analysis on brain capillary morphology has identified at least two types of capillary states: capillaries with diameters that are relatively large at rest and stable over time regardless of neural activity and capillaries whose diameters are relatively small at rest and vary according to neural activity.",

Interestingly, in the embryo <i>Prrx1eGFP</i>-labeled cells become restricted around the Sox9-positive cartilage anlage without themselves becoming Sox9-positive. In the adult, the <i>Prrx1eGFP</i> transgene live labels a subpopulation of cells within the periosteum that are enriched at specific sites, and this population is diminished in aged mice. The green fluorescent protein (GFP)-labeled subpopulation can be isolated using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and represents approximately 8% of all isolated periosteal cells. The GFP-labeled subpopulation is significantly more osteogenic than unlabeled, GFP-negative periosteal cells. In addition, the osteogenic and chondrogenic capacity of periosteal cells in vitro can be extended with the addition of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) to the expansion media. We provide evidence to suggest that osteoblasts contributing to cortical bone formation in the embryo originate from <i>Prrx1eGFP</i>-positive cells within the perichondrium, which possibly piggyback on invading vascular cells and secrete new bone matrix.

Little is known about the variance in these cytoplasmic properties. Here, we employed particle-tracking nanorheology on genetically encoded multimeric 40 nm nanoparticles (GEMs) to measure diffusion within the cytoplasm of individual fission yeast (Schizosaccharomyces pombe) cellscells. We found that the apparent diffusion coefficients of individual GEM particles varied over a 400-fold range, while the differences in average particle diffusivity among individual cells spanned a 10-fold range. To determine the origin of this heterogeneity, we developed a Doppelgänger simulation approach that uses stochastic simulations of GEM diffusion that replicate the experimental statistics on a particle-by-particle basis, such that each experimental track and cell had a one-to-one correspondence with their simulated counterpart. These simulations showed that the large intra- and inter-cellular variations in diffusivity could not be explained by experimental variability but could only be reproduced with stochastic models that assume a wide intra- and inter-cellular variation in cytoplasmic viscosity. The simulation combining intra- and inter-cellular variation in viscosity also predicted weak nonergodicity in GEM diffusion, consistent with the experimental data. To probe the origin of this variation, we found that the variance in GEM diffusivity was largely independent of factors such as temperature, the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons, cell-cyle stage, and spatial locations, but was magnified by hyperosmotic shocks. Taken together, our results provide a striking demonstration that the cytoplasm is not \"well-mixed\" but represents a highly heterogeneous environment in which subcellular components at the 40 nm size scale experience dramatically different effective viscosities within an individual cell, as well as in different cells in a genetically identical population.

Arterially perfused rat preparations were prepared 3-4 weeks after the injection of a neuron-specific virus expressing GCaMP6f. Fictive swallowing was induced by repetitive electrical stimulation of the superior laryngeal nerve (SLN). Simultaneously, the activity of GCaMP6f-expressing neurons in the dorsal brainstem, between 0.1 and 4.8 mm rostral to the obex, was assessed by changes in the intracellular calcium concentration using confocal laser microscopy. Neurons responding to stimulation of the SLN included swallowing-related neurons (48%), which showed an increase in fluorescence intensity at the time of swallowing bursts in the cervical vagus nerve, and stimulation-related neurons (52%), which showed an increase in fluorescence intensity through stimulation, regardless of the swallowing bursts. Despite a broad search area, swallowing-related neurons were localized exclusively in and around the solitary nucleus. In contrast, most stimulation-related neurons were located in the brainstem reticular formation, which is more rostral than the solitary nucleus. Calcium imaging using GCaMP in arterially perfused rat preparations is useful for an efficient search of the activity pattern and distribution of neurons located in a wide area of the brainstem.",

However, due to the fact that the PAM cells can only be obtained from primary tissues, research on PAM-based virus-host interactions remains challenging. The improvement of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) technology provides a new strategy to develop IPSCs-derived PAM cells. Since the CD163 is a macrophage-specific marker and a validated receptor essential for PRRSV infection, generation of stable porcine induced pluripotent stem cells lines containing CD163 reporter system play important roles in the investigation of IPSCs-PAM transition and PAM-based virus-host interaction. Based on the CRISPR/Cas9- mediated gene editing system, we designed a sgRNA targeting CD163 locus and constructed the corresponding donor vectors. To test whether this reporter system has the expected function, the reporter system was introduced into primary PAM cells to detect the expression of RFP. To validate the low effect on stem cell pluripotency, we generated porcine iPSC lines containing CD163 reporter and assessed the pluripotency through multiple assays such as alkaline phosphatase staining, immunofluorescent staining, and EdU staining. The red-fluorescent protein (RFP) expression was detected in CD163-edited PAM cells, suggesting that our reporter system indeed has the ability to reflect the expression of gene <i>CD163</i>. Compared with wild-type (WT) iPSCs, the CD163 reporter-iPSCs display similar pluripotency-associated transcription factors expression. Besides, cells with the reporter system showed consistent cell morphology and proliferation ability as compared to WT iPSCs, indicating that the edited-cells have no effect on stem cell pluripotency. In conclusion, we generated porcine iPSCs that contain a CD163 reporter system. Our results demonstrated that this reporter system was functional and safe.

        "abstract": "Enzyme engineering using machine learning has been developed in recent years. However, to obtain a large amount of data on enzyme activities for training data, it is necessary to develop a high-throughput and accurate method for evaluating enzyme activities. Here, we examined whether a biosensor-based enzyme engineering method can be applied to machine learning. As a model experiment, we aimed to modify the substrate specificity of XylM<i>,</i> a rate-determining enzyme in a multistep oxidation reaction catalyzed by XylMABC in <i>Pseudomonas putida</i>. XylMABC naturally converts toluene and xylene to benzoic acid and toluic acid, respectively. We aimed to engineer XylM to improve its conversion efficiency to a non-native substrate, 2,6-xylenol. Wild-type XylMABC slightly converted 2,6-xylenol to 3-methylsalicylic acid, which is the ligand of the transcriptional regulator XylS in <i>P. putida</i>. By locating a fluorescent protein gene under the control of the <i>Pm</i> promoter to which XylS binds, a XylS-producing <i>Escherichia coli</i> strain showed higher fluorescence intensity in a 3-methylsalicylic acid concentration-dependent manner. We evaluated the 3-methylsalicylic acid productivity of XylM variants using the fluorescence intensity of the sensor strain as an indicator. The obtained data provided the training data for machine learning for the directed evolution of XylM. Two cycles of machine learning-assisted directed evolution resulted in the acquisition of XylM-D140E-V144K-F243L-N244S with 15 times higher productivity than wild-type XylM. These results demonstrate that an indirect enzyme activity evaluation method using biosensors is sufficiently quantitative and high-throughput to be used as training data for machine learning. The findings expand the versatility of machine learning in enzyme engineering.",

Genetically encoded voltage indicators (GEVIs) open the path to high throughput visualization of undisturbed neuronal activity. However, conventional GEVIs perturb membrane integrity through inserting multiple copies of transmembrane domains into the plasma membrane. To circumvent large add-ons to the plasma membrane, we used a minimally invasive novel hybrid dark quencher GEVI to record the physiological and pathological firing patterns of hiPSCs-derived sensory neurons from patients with inherited erythromelalgia, a chronic pain condition associated with recurrent attacks of redness and swelling in the distal extremities. We observed considerable differences in action potential firing patterns between patient and control neurons that were previously overlooked with other recording methods. Our system also performed well in hiPSC-derived forebrain neurons where it detected spontaneous synchronous bursting behavior, thus opening the path to future applications in other cell types and disease models including Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, and schizophrenia, conditions associated with disturbances of neuronal activity and synchrony.",

The majority of apicoplast-resident proteins are encoded by the nuclear genome and target the apicoplast via bipartite targeting signals consisting of a signal peptide and a transit peptide. The properties and functions of these peptides are poorly understood, which hinders the identification of apicoplast proteins and the study for plastid evolution. Here, the targeting signals of the recently discovered apicoplast tRNA thiouridylase TgMnmA of Toxoplasma gondii were analyzed. Our data using a reporter (the enhanced green fluorescent protein) fused with individual fragments containing various numbers of its N-terminal amino acids unequivocally revealed that the first 28 amino acids of TgMnmA functioned as a signal peptide for cellular secretion. The N-terminal 150 amino acids were sufficient to direct the fusion protein to the apicoplast, whereas its deletion caused the fusion protein to be localized to the mitochondrion. Our data further demonstrated that the apicoplast, rhoptry, and mitochondrion shared similar targeting signals, indicating that the apicoplast localization peptide was trans-organellar in function. In addition, the apicoplast localization peptide was important for the healthy proliferation of tachyzoites. In conclusion, the targeting signals of the nucleus-encoded apicoplast-targeted protein TgMnmA have been mapped out and the importance of this localization peptide has been elucidated in the current study.",

We examined the effects of pregabalin on oxaliplatin-evoked unmasking of cold sensitive neurons using mice expressing GCaMP-3 in all sensory neurons. Intravenous injection of pregabalin significantly ameliorates cold allodynia, while decreasing the number of cold sensitive neurons by altering their excitability and temperature thresholds. The silenced neurons are predominantly medium/large mechano-cold sensitive neurons, corresponding to the \"silent\" cold sensors activated during neuropathy.

Tumor stem cells are characterized by high proliferation ability, high plasticity, expression of multi-drug resistance proteins, and the ability to seed new tumors. Octamer-binding transcription factor 4 (Oct-4) and its activation targets are overexpressed in the tumor stem cells of various types of tumors, and this expression is associated with the pathogenesis, development, and poor prognosis of tumors. The primary objective of this study was to test if a stably transfected with Oct-4 gene cell line, RL95-2/Oct-4, has the characteristics of tumor stem cells. Human endometrial carcinoma cells (RL95-2) were transfected with a plasmid carrying genes for Oct-4 and green fluorescent protein (GFP). The stably transfected cells, RL95-2/Oct-4, were selected using G418 and observed to express the GFP reporter gene under the control of the Oct-4 promoter. GFP expression levels of RL95-2/Oct-4 cells were measured using flow cytometry. The proliferation potential of cells was determined according to cumulative population doubling and colony-formation efficiency. Gene expression was analyzed using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. RL95-2/Oct-4 cells not only exhibited increased expression of the three most important stem cell genes, Oct-4, Nanog, and Sox2, but also had increased expression of the endometrial tumor stem cell genes CD133 and ALDH1. Furthermore, enhanced expression of these genes in the RL95-2/Oct-4 cells was associated with higher colony-forming ability and growth rate than in parental RL95-2 cells. We also observed that cisplatin induced less cell death in RL95-2/Oct-4 cells than in RL95-2 cells, indicating that RL95-2/Oct-4 cells were more resistant to chemotherapeutic agents. The study findings contribute to investigate the effects of Oct-4 on tumor stem cell origins.",

Qualitative interviews with eligible physical therapists were conducted remotely. Physical therapists were asked to spontaneously suggest movement tasks prior to evaluating specific movement tasks selected a priori.

Reports of varying proportions of subtype marker expression have employed different dissection techniques to achieve wholemount muscularis preparations of myenteric plexus. In this study we asked whether differences in GI dissection methods could introduce variability into the quantification of marker expression. We compared three commonly used methods of ENS wholemount dissection: two flat-sheet preparations that differed in the order of microdissection and fixation as well as a rod-mounted peeling technique. We assessed marker expression using immunohistochemistry, genetic reporter lines, confocal microscopy, and automated image analysis. We found no significant differences between the two flat-sheet preparation methods in the expression of calretinin, neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), or somatostatin (SST) in ileum myenteric plexus. However, the rod-mounted peeling method resulted in decreased marker labeling for both calretinin and nNOS. This method also resulted in decreased transgenic reporter fluorescent protein (tdTomato) for substance P in ileum and choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) in both ileum and distal colon. These results suggest that labeling among some markers, both native protein and transgenic fluorescent reporters, is decreased by the rod-mounted mechanical method of peeling, demonstrating a critical variability in wholemount muscularis dissection methods.",

These Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals are readily visualized using plants expressing green fluorescent protein-based Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitive bioreporters, such as those of the GCaMP and GECO families. Dissecting the underlying molecular machinery behind this systemic spread of information is often approached by imaging the Ca<sup>2+</sup> response in mutants in candidate genes. Introducing the GFP sensor into the relevant genetic backgrounds and then selecting lines usable for imaging can be very time consuming. An alternative, more rapid approach to screening these candidates is through virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS), where target genes are suppressed in the wild-type bioreporter expressing plants.

In Arabidopsis (A. thaliana), a rate-limiting step in ascorbate biosynthesis is a phosphorylase encoded by Vitamin C Defective 2 (VTC2). To specifically overexpress VTC2 (VTC2 OE) in pollen, the coding region was expressed using a promoter from a gene with ∼150-fold higher expression in pollen, leading to pollen grains with an eight-fold increased VTC2 mRNA. VTC2 OE resulted in a near-sterile phenotype with a 50-fold decrease in pollen transmission efficiency and a five-fold reduction in the number of seeds per silique. In vitro assays revealed pollen grains were more prone to bursting (greater than two-fold) or produced shorter, morphologically abnormal pollen tubes. The inclusion of a genetically encoded Ca2+ reporter, mCherry-GCaMP6fast (CGf), revealed pollen tubes with altered tip-focused Ca2+ dynamics and increased bursting frequency during periods of oscillatory and arrested growth. Despite these phenotypes, VTC2 OE pollen failed to show expected increases in ascorbate or reductions in reactive oxygen species, as measured using a redox-sensitive dye or a roGFP2. However, mRNA expression analyses revealed greater than two-fold reductions in mRNA encoding two enzymes critical to biosynthetic pathways related to cell walls or glyco-modifications of lipids and proteins: GDP-d-mannose pyrophosphorylase (GMP) and GDP-d-mannose 3',5' epimerase (GME). These results support a model in which the near-sterile defects resulting from VTC2 OE in pollen are associated with feedback mechanisms that can alter one or more signaling or metabolic pathways critical to pollen tube growth and fertility.",

Utilizing GPCR-activation-based (GRAB) neurotransmitter sensors, we found that KC-released acetylcholine (ACh) activates a serotonergic dorsal paired medial (DPM) neuron, which in turn provides inhibitory feedback to KCs. Physiological stimuli induce spatially heterogeneous 5-HT signals, which proportionally gate the intrinsic coincidence time windows of different MB compartments. Artificially reducing or increasing the DPM neuron-released 5-HT shortens or prolongs the coincidence window, respectively. In a sequential trace conditioning paradigm, this serotonergic neuromodulation helps to bridge the CS-US temporal gap.

We have developed an optical and surgical preparation that preserves wide-field imaging of the cortical surface while also permitting access to specific subcortical networks. This was achieved using an optical fiber implanted in the striatum, along with a bilateral widefield cranial window, enabling simultaneous mesoscale cortical imaging and subcortical fiber photometry recording of calcium signals in a transgenic animal expressing GCaMP. Subcortical signals were collected from the dorsal regions of the striatum. We combined this approach with multiple sensory-motor tasks, including specific auditory and visual stimulation, and video monitoring of animal movements and pupillometry during head-fixed behaviors. We found high correlations between cortical and striatal activity in response to sensory stimulation or movement. Furthermore, spontaneous activity recordings revealed that specific motifs of cortical activity are correlated with presynaptic activity recorded in the striatum, enabling us to select for corticostriatal activity motifs.

Anhydrobiosis has been a biological enigma for more than a century with respect to how organisms sustain life without water, but the few choices of genetic toolkits available in tardigrade research have been a challenging circumstance. Here, we report the development of an in vivo expression system for tardigrades. This transient transgenic technique is based on a plasmid vector (TardiVec) with promoters that originated from an anhydrobiotic tardigrade <i>Ramazzottius varieornatus</i>. It enables the introduction of GFP-fused proteins and genetically encoded indicators such as the Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator GCaMP into tardigrade cells; consequently, the dynamics of proteins and cells in tardigrades may be observed by fluorescence live imaging. This system is applicable for several tardigrades in the class Eutardigrada: the promoters of anhydrobiosis-related genes showed tissue-specific expression in this work. Surprisingly, promoters functioned similarly between multiple species, even for species with different modes of expression of anhydrobiosis-related genes, such as <i>Hypsibius exemplaris,</i> in which these genes are highly induced upon facing desiccation, and <i>Thulinius ruffoi</i>, which lacks anhydrobiotic capability. These results suggest that the highly dynamic expression changes in desiccation-induced species are regulated in <i>trans</i>. Tissue-specific expression of tardigrade-unique unstructured proteins also suggests differing anhydrobiosis machinery depending on the cell types.

        "abstract": "Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most prevalent joint disorder with increasing worldwide incidence. Mechanistic insights into OA pathophysiology are evolving and there are currently no disease-modifying OA drugs. An increase in protease activity is linked to progressive degradation of the cartilage in OA. Proteases also trigger inflammation through a family of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) called the Proteinase-Activated Receptors (PARs). PAR signaling can trigger pro-inflammatory responses and targeting PARs is proposed as a therapeutic approach in OA. Several enzymes can cleave the PAR N-terminus, but the endogenous protease activators of PARs in OA remain unclear. Here we characterized PAR activating enzymes in knee joint synovial fluids from OA patients and healthy donors using genetically encoded PAR biosensor expressing cells. Calcium signaling assays were performed to examine receptor activation. The class and type of enzymes cleaving the PARs was further characterized using protease inhibitors and fluorogenic substrates. We find that PAR1, PAR2 and PAR4 activating enzymes are present in knee joint synovial fluids from healthy controls and OA patients. Compared to healthy controls, PAR1 activating enzymes are elevated in OA synovial fluids while PAR4 activating enzyme levels are decreased. Using enzyme class and type selective inhibitors and fluorogenic substrates we find that multiple PAR activating enzymes are present in OA joint fluids and identify serine proteinases (thrombin and trypsin-like) and matrix metalloproteinases as the major classes of PAR activating enzymes in the OA synovial fluids. Synovial fluid driven increase in calcium signaling was significantly reduced in cells treated with PAR1 and PAR2 antagonists, but not in PAR4 antagonist treated cells. OA associated elevation of PAR1 cleavage suggests that targeting this receptor may be beneficial in the treatment of OA.",

        "abstract": "Layered assembly is a voxel-based additive manufacturing process that relies on parallel grasping of voxels to produce multi-material parts. Although there exists substantial diversity in mechanisms of gripping, there still exists a lack of consistency, accuracy, and efficacy in positioning very large numbers of milli-, micro-, and nano-scale objects. We demonstrate the use of parallel electro-osmotic grippers to selectively transport multiple millimeter-sized voxels simultaneously. In contrast to previous research focused on using arrays of droplets to grab a single substrate, each element in the array is individually controlled via capillary effects, which are, in turn, controlled by an electric field to create predetermined patterns of droplets to pick and place selected objects. The demonstrated fluidic pick-and-place method has two key advantages: It is suitable for transport of fragile and complex objects due to the lack of mechanical contact, and it easily parallelizes to arbitrary array sizes for massively parallel pick-and-place. This work demonstrates a 25-element parallel assembly of 1.5-mm spheres with 95-98% grasping reliability, in a variety of geometric patterns. Experimental performance was validated against both analytical and computational models. The results suggest that electro-osmotic droplet arrays may enable the additive manufacturing of multi-material objects containing millions of components in the same print bed.",

        "abstract": "The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is composed of functionally distinct subpopulations of GABAergic neurons which form a neural network responsible for synchronizing most physiological and behavioral circadian rhythms in mammals. To date, little is known regarding which aspects of SCN rhythmicity are generated by individual SCN neurons, and which aspects result from neuronal interaction within a network. Here, we utilize in vivo miniaturized microscopy to measure fluorescent GCaMP-reported calcium dynamics in arginine vasopressin (AVP)-expressing neurons in the intact SCN of awake, behaving mice. We report that SCN AVP neurons exhibit periodic, slow calcium waves which we demonstrate, using in vivo electrical recordings, likely reflect burst firing. Further, we observe substantial heterogeneity of function in that AVP neurons exhibit unstable rhythms, and relatively weak rhythmicity at the population level. Network analysis reveals that correlated cellular behavior, or coherence, among neuron pairs also exhibited stochastic rhythms with about 33% of pairs rhythmic at any time. Unlike single-cell variables, coherence exhibited a strong rhythm at the population level with time of maximal coherence among AVP neuronal pairs at CT/ZT 6 and 9, coinciding with the timing of maximal neuronal activity for the SCN as a whole. These results demonstrate robust circadian variation in the coordination between stochastically rhythmic neurons and that interactions between AVP neurons in the SCN may be more influential than single-cell activity in the regulation of circadian rhythms. Furthermore, they demonstrate that cells in this circuit, like those in many other circuits, exhibit profound heterogenicity of function over time and space.",

Spontaneous vasomotion is a change in arteriolar diameter that occurs without sensory stimulation, at low frequency (∼0.1 Hz). These vessel diameter changes are a driving force for perivascular soluble waste clearance, the failure of which has been implicated in neurodegenerative disease. Stimulus-evoked vascular reactivity is known to propagate along penetrating arterioles to pial arterioles, but it is unclear whether spontaneous vasomotion propagates similarly. We therefore imaged both stimulus-evoked and spontaneous changes in pial arteriole diameter in awake, head-fixed mice with 2-photon microscopy. By cross-correlating different regions of interest (ROIs) along the length of imaged arterioles, we assessed vasomotion propagation. We found that both during rest and during visual stimulation, one-third of the arterioles showed significant propagation (i.e., a wave), with a median (interquartile range) wave speed of 405 (323) µm/s at rest and 345 (177) µm/s during stimulation. In a second group of mice, with GCaMP expression in their vascular smooth muscle cells, we also found spontaneous propagation of calcium signaling along pial arterioles.

ChAT, is produced in the body of the neuron, transported to the nerve terminal (where its concentration is highest), and catalyzes the transfer of an acetyl group from the coenzyme acetyl-CoA to choline, yielding ACh. The creation of bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) transgenic mice that express promoter-specific fluorescent reporter proteins (green fluorescent protein-[GFP]) provided an enormous advantage for neuroscience. Both in vivo and in vitro experimental methods benefited from the transgenic visualization of cholinergic neurons. Mice were created by adding a BAC clone into the ChAT locus, in which enhanced GFP (eGFP) is inserted into exon 3 at the ChAT initiation codon, robustly and supposedly selectively expressing eGFP in all cholinergic neurons and fibers in the central and peripheral nervous systems as well as in non-neuronal cells. This project systematically compared the exact distribution of the ChAT-eGFP expressing neurons in the brain with the expression of ChAT by immunohistochemistry using mapping and also made comparisons with in situ hybridization (ISH). We qualitatively described the distribution of ChAT-eGFP neurons in the mouse brain by comparing it with the distribution of immunoreactive neurons and ISH data, paying special attention to areas where the expression did not overlap, such as the cortex, striatum, thalamus and hypothalamus. We found a complete overlap between the transgenic expression of eGFP and the immunohistochemical staining in the areas of the cholinergic basal forebrain. However, in the cortex and hippocampus, we found small neurons that were only labeled with the antibody and not expressed eGFP or vice versa. Most importantly, we found no transgenic expression of eGFP in the lateral dorsal, ventral and dorsomedial tegmental nuclei cholinergic cells. While the majority of the forebrain ChAT expression was aligned in the transgenic animals with immunohistochemistry, other areas of interest, such as the brainstem should be considered before choosing this particular transgenic mouse line.",

This method negates many blood chemistry disturbances associated with grab 'n' stab (i.e., low pH and oxygen, elevated lactate, CO<sub>2</sub> and stress hormones) and generates results that are directly comparable to cannulated fish under a wide range of experimentally-induced acid-base scenarios (acidosis and alkalosis).

Therefore, this study aims to show the results of using Metaverse in the form of virtual space in the educational field and how teachers and students respond to the process. In this study, the authors would like to conduct a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) on the advantages and disadvantages of virtual educational spaces in Metaverse based on many previous studies related to this topic. Survey results conducted by previous studies show that students mostly enjoy using Metaverse as their learning method and can comprehend several lessons better when using Metaverse than traditional learning- textbook-based and face-to-face learning. Unfortunately, only several studies focus on finding preferred subjects to teach using the Metaverse and for which educational level this method suits best. In general, the authors conclude that Metaverse has excellent potential in the future to be explored profoundly in the education field due to the development of skills in the use of technology and a significant increase in student practice scores.

However, a causative role of neuronal oxidative stress in the development of aging-related cognitive decline and neurodegeneration remains elusive because of the lack of approaches for modeling isolated oxidative injury in the brain. Here, we present a chemogenetic approach based on the yeast flavoprotein d-amino acid oxidase (DAAO) for the generation of intraneuronal hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>). To validate this chemogenetic tool, DAAO and HyPer7, an ultrasensitive genetically encoded H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> biosensor, were targeted to neurons. Changes in the fluorescence of HyPer7 upon treatment of neurons expressing DAAO with d-norvaline (D-Nva), a DAAO substrate, confirmed chemogenetically induced production of intraneuornal H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Then, using the verified chemogenetic tool, we emulated isolated intraneuronal oxidative stress in acute brain slices and, using electrophysiological recordings, revealed that it does not alter basal synaptic transmission and the probability of neurotransmitter release from presynaptic terminals but reduces long-term potentiation (LTP). Moreover, treating neurons expressing DAAO with D-Nva via the patch pipette also decreases LTP. This observation indicates that isolated oxidative stress affects synaptic plasticity at single cell level. Our results broaden the toolset for studying normal redox regulation in the brain and elucidating the role of oxidative stress to the pathogenesis of cognitive aging and the early stages of aging-related neurodegenerative diseases. The proposed approach is useful for identification of early markers of neuronal oxidative stress and may be used in screens of potential antioxidants effective against neuronal oxidative injury.",

The purpose of this study was to investigate the apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of nutrients in different fiber-rich diets and to quantify whole-body metabolism and utilization of energy and nitrogen (N) in gestating sows. Four fiber-rich diets based on sugar beet pulp (SBP), soy hulls (SH), palm kernel expellers (PKE), or a mixed fiber (MF) were formulated, with an average daily intake of total fiber (TF) of 471, 507, 651, and 437 g/d, respectively. A total of 48 multiparous sows were stratified by body weight at mating (day 0) and assigned to one of the four diets throughout gestation. Body weight and backfat were measured, and body pools of fat and protein were estimated using the deuterium oxide dilution technique at days 0, 30, and 60. On days 30 and 60, urine and fecal grab samples were obtained. On days 15 and 45, heart rate was measured to estimate total heat production. The ATTD of nutrients differed across treatments (P < 0.001), while in vivo organic matter digestibility deviated with up to ±3.3% units from in vitro enzyme digestibility of organic matter. The ATTD of energy was highly negatively correlated with intake of lignin (P < 0.001), while ATTD of N was highest (negatively) correlated (P < 0.001) with intake of insoluble non-starch polysaccharides (NSP). The ATTD of all nutrients except NSP was lowest in PKE-fed sows and highest, except for N, in sows fed the SBP diet. The ATTD of N was highest in the MF-fed sows and ATTD of NSP was lowest in the MF-fed sows. Sows lost most energy as heat (53% to 72% of gross energy intake), followed by energy in feces (15% to 17%), urine (3% to 4%), and methane (0.5% to 0.9%). Energy for maintenance accounted for the majority of the heat production and the total energy retention was lowest and highest in the SBP- and PKE-fed sows, with a retention of 3.3 and 13.3 MJ/d, respectively (P < 0.001). Sows lost most N through urine, the lowest and highest N loss (relative to intake) was observed in SH- and SBP-fed sows (50% to 63%, respectively), while 14% to 26% was retained as body protein. In conclusion, the fiber-rich diets were utilized efficiently by gestating sows with respect to energy with ATTD values above 82% in all four fiber-rich diets, whereas the high TF content in the diets compromised the N utilization in gestating sows.",

Measurements of metals' bioavailable concentrations and toxicities simultaneously and in-situ in environments can advance the understanding of their hazardous effects. The diffusive gradients in thin-films (DGT) is an in-situ technique can measure metal speciation and labile concentrations, but cannot yet provide the direct toxicity information. The whole-cell bioreporter Acinetobacter baylyi ADPWH_recA was successfully incorporated into the DGT device to develop a novel technique, Bio-DGT, for assessing the toxicity of metals at the same time of measuring their labile concentrations. The bioassay used in Bio-DGT can sense the mixture toxicity from multiple contaminants and the DGT can assist in identifying which toxicants may be causing the toxicity. Cadmium was used as the model metal to test the performance of Bio-DGT in waters and soils. The masses of Cd accumulated in Bio-DGT increased linearly and theoretically with time for 7 days deployment, indicating little influences from bioreporter cells on DGT performance. A positive relationship between bioluminescent signals towards Cd demonstrated the sensitive and active bioreporters' response. The sensitive of Bio-DGT, indicated by Cd concentrations causing the response, is 0.01 mg/L. The stable response from Bio-DGT under various conditions (pH 4-8, ionic strengths 0.01-0.5 M) and 30 days storage time suggest the applicability of the technique in real environments. The deployment of Bio-DGT in contaminated soils demonstrated that Cd toxicity was regulated by labile concentration, showing its potential application for the risk assessment of heavy metal contaminations, and its further feasibility in using Bio-DGT for measuring integration of multiple contaminants' effects and simultaneously determine the main toxicity driver(s).",

        "abstract": "The intertwined adoption of synthetic biology and 3D bioprinting has the potential to improve different application fields by fabricating engineered living materials (ELMs) with unnatural genetically-encoded sense & response capabilities. However, efforts are still needed to streamline the fabrication of sensing ELMs compatible with field use and improving their functional complexity. To investigate these two unmet needs, we adopted a workflow to reproducibly construct bacterial ELMs with synthetic biosensing circuits that provide red pigmentation as visible readout in response to different proof-of-concept chemical inducers. We first fabricated single-input/single-output ELMs and we demonstrated their robust performance in terms of longevity (cell viability and evolutionary stability >15 days, and long-term storage >1 month), sensing in harsh, non-sterile or nutrient-free conditions compatible with field use (soil, water, and clinical samples, including real samples from <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> infected patients). Then, we fabricated ELMs including multiple spatially-separated biosensor strains to engineer: level-bar materials detecting molecule concentration ranges, multi-input/multi-output devices with multiplexed sensing and information processing capabilities, and materials with cell-cell communication enabling on-demand pattern formation. Overall, we showed successful field use and multiplexed functioning of reproducibly fabricated ELMs, paving the way to a future automation of the prototyping process and boosting applications of such devices as in-situ monitoring tools or easy-to-use sensing kits.",

We show that the combination of a chemically resistant biological nanopore, α-hemolysin (narrowest part is ~1.4 nm in diameter), and a high concentration guanidinium chloride buffer enables unidirectional, single-file protein transport propelled by an electroosmotic effect. We show that the mean protein translocation velocity depends linearly on the applied voltage and translocation times depend linearly on length, resembling the translocation dynamics of ssDNA. Using a supervised machine-learning classifier, we demonstrate that single-translocation events contain sufficient information to distinguish their threading orientation and identity with accuracies larger than 90%.

Sensitive genetically-encoded fluorescent glutamate reporters operating with a range of affinities and emission wavelengths are available. However, without targeting to synapses, the specificity of the fluorescent signal is uncertain, compared to sensors directed at vesicles or other synaptic markers. We fused the state-of-the-art reporter iGluSnFR to glutamate receptor auxiliary proteins in order to target it to postsynaptic sites. Chimeras of Stargazin and gamma-8 that we named SnFR-γ2 and SnFR-γ8, were enriched at synapses, retained function and reported spontaneous glutamate release in rat hippocampal cells, with apparently diffraction-limited spatial precision. In autaptic mouse neurons cultured on astrocytic microislands, evoked neurotransmitter release could be quantitatively detected at tens of synapses in a field of view whilst evoked currents were recorded simultaneously. These experiments revealed a specific postsynaptic deficit from Stargazin overexpression, resulting in synapses with normal neurotransmitter release but without postsynaptic responses. This defect was reverted by delaying overexpression. By working at different calcium concentrations, we determined that SnFR-γ2 is a linear reporter of the global quantal parameters and short-term synaptic plasticity, whereas iGluSnFR is not. On average, half of iGluSnFR regions of interest (ROIs) showing evoked fluorescence changes had intense rundown, whereas less than 5% of SnFR-γ2 ROIs did. We provide an open-source analysis suite for extracting quantal parameters including release probability from fluorescence time series of individual and grouped synaptic responses. Taken together, postsynaptic targeting improves several properties of iGluSnFR and further demonstrates the importance of subcellular targeting for optogenetic actuators and reporters.",

We designed a robot control system using electromyography signals. In each trial, participants were exposed to different experiences as the cutoff frequencies of a low-pass filter were changed. The participants attempted to grab a bottle by controlling a robot. They were asked to evaluate four indicators (stability, imitation, response time, and movement speed) and indicate their satisfaction at the end of each trial by completing a questionnaire. The electroencephalography signals of the participants were recorded while they controlled the robot and responded to the questionnaire. Two independent component clusters in the precuneus and postcentral gyrus were the most sensitive to subjective evaluations. For the moment that dominated satisfaction, we observed that brain activity exhibited significant differences in satisfaction not immediately after feeding an input but during the later stage. The other indicators exhibited independently significant patterns in event-related spectral perturbations. Comparing these indicators in a low-frequency band related to the satisfaction with imitation and movement speed, which had significant differences, revealed that imitation covered significant intervals in satisfaction. This implies that imitation was the most important contributing factor among the four indicators. Our results reveal that regardless of subjective satisfaction, objective performance evaluation might more fully reflect user satisfaction.",

In this paper, luminous marine bacteria and their coupled NAD(P)H:FMN-oxidoreductase + luciferase (Red + Luc) enzyme system was applied to examine the effects of different types of surfactants, including cationic cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), non-ionic polyoxyethylene 20 sorbitan monooleate (Tween 80) and anionic sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS), and to assess whether the Red + Luc enzyme system can be used as a more sensitive indicator of toxicity. It was shown that the greatest inhibitory effect of the surfactants on the activity of luminous bacteria and the Red + Luc enzyme system was in the presence of SLS samples. The calculated IC<sub>50</sub> and EC<sub>50</sub> values of SLS were 10<sup>-5</sup> M and 10<sup>-2</sup> M for the enzymatic and cellular assay systems, respectively. The results highlight the benefits of using the enzymatic assay system in ecotoxicology as a tool for revealing surfactant effects on intracellular proteins if the cellular membrane is damaged under a long-term exposure period in the presence of the surfactants. For this purpose, the bioluminescent enzyme-inhibition-based assay could be used as an advanced research tool for the evaluation of surfactant toxicity at the molecular level of living organisms due to its technical simplicity and rapid response time.",

Despite the demand, there is a dearth of such probes because NIR substrates (e.g., BL660 (a NIR luciferin analog)) are not equipped with an appropriate attachment site for ABS trigger installation. For instance, our attempts to mask the carboxylic acid moiety with standard self-immolative benzyl linkers resulted in significant background signals owing to undesirable ester hydrolysis. In this study, we overcame this longstanding challenge by rationally designing a new hydrolysis-resistant ester-based linker featuring an isopropyl shielding arm. Compared to the parent, the new design is 140.5-fold and 67.8-fold more resistant toward spontaneous and esterase-mediated hydrolysis, respectively. Likewise, we observed minimal cleavage of the ester moiety when incubated with a panel of enzymes possessing ester-hydrolyzing activity. These impressive in vitro results were corroborated through a series of key experiments in live cells. Further, we showcased the utility of this technology by developing the first NIR bioluminescent probe for nitroreductase (NTR) activity and applied it to visualize elevated NTR expression in oxygen deficient lung cancer cells and in a murine model of non-small cell lung cancer. The ability to monitor the activity of this key biomarker in a deep tissue context is critical because it is associated with tumor hypoxia, which in turn is linked to drug resistance and aggressive cancer phenotypes.",

To test the feasibility of the FALCOscope, we quantified G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)-stimulated Protein Kinase A activity and cAMP responses to GPCR agonists and antagonists. We also characterized cAMP dynamics induced by GPR68/OGR1, a proton-sensing GPCR, in response to variable extracellular pH values. GPR68-induced cAMP responses were more transient in acidic than neutral pH values, suggesting a pH-dependence for signal attenuation. Ogerin, a GPR68 positive allosteric modulator, enhanced cAMP response most strongly at pH 7.0 and sustained cAMP response for acidic pH values, thereby demonstrating the capability of the FALCOscope to capture allosteric modulation. At a high concentration, ogerin increased cAMP signaling independent of GPR68, likely via phosphodiesterase inhibition. The FALCOscope system thus enables enhanced throughput single-cell dynamic measurements and is a versatile system for interrogating spatiotemporal regulation of signaling molecules in living cells and for drug profiling and screening.",

We attempted to conceptually replicate the findings of one of these studies (Newall et al., 2021), while addressing some limitations of that study. A cross-sectional survey of 2,000 UK-based and -born participants aged 19-24 years.

Logistic regression models showed that adult gamblers were more likely to recollect using, and used at higher levels of frequency, coin pusher and crane grab machines, than non-gamblers. Then, negative binomial regression analysis showed that adults who recollected using crane grab machines at higher levels of frequency showed more gambling-related problems. These results suggest that childhood usage of coin pusher and crane grab machines may act as an underappreciated risk factor for the development of gambling-related harm across the lifespan.

Several genes in the <i>mnt</i>-operon of <i>E. coli</i> respond to intercellular Mn(II) levels, and transcription is regulated by a transcription factor (MntR) that interacts with Mn(II). This study aimed to develop Mn(II)-sensing biosensors based on <i>mnt</i>-operon genetic systems. Additionally, the properties of biosensors developed based on the promoter regions of <i>mntS</i>, <i>mntH</i>, and <i>mntP</i> were investigated. MntR represses the transcription of MntS and MntH after binding with Mn(II), while it induces MntP transcription. Thus, Mn(II) biosensors that decrease and increase signals could be obtained by fusing the promoter regions of <i>mntS/mntH</i> and <i>mntP</i>, with <i>egfp</i> encoding an enhanced green fluorescent protein. However, only the biosensor-based <i>mntS:egfp</i> responded to Mn(II) exposure. Further, <i>E. coli</i> harboring <i>P <sub><i>mntS</i></sub> :egfp</i> showed a concentration-dependent decrease in fluorescence signals. To enhance the sensitivity of the biosensor toward Mn(II), <i>E. coli</i> containing a deleted MntP gene that encodes Mn(II) exporter, was used as a host cell for biosensor development. The sensitivity toward Mn(II) increased by two times on using <i>E. coli-mntP</i>, and the biosensor could quantify 0.01-10 μM of Mn(II). Further, the applicability of Mn(II) in artificially contaminated water samples was quantified and showed >95% accuracy. The newly developed Mn(II) biosensors could detect and quantify the residual Mn(II) from mancozeb in soil samples, with the quantification accuracy being approximately 90%.

However, recent data indicate that VTA DAergic neurons are functionally heterogeneous with emerging roles in aversive signaling, salience, and novelty, based in part on anatomic location and projection, highlighting a need to functionally characterize the repertoire of VTA DAergic efferents in motivated behavior. Previous work identifying a mesointerpeduncular circuit consisting of VTA DAergic neurons projecting to the interpeduncular nucleus (IPN), a midbrain area implicated in aversion, anxiety-like behavior, and familiarity, has recently come into question. To verify the existence of this circuit, we combined presynaptic targeted and retrograde viral tracing in the dopamine transporter-Cre mouse line. Consistent with previous reports, synaptic tracing revealed that axon terminals from the VTA innervate the caudal IPN; whereas, retrograde tracing revealed DAergic VTA neurons, predominantly in the paranigral region, project to the nucleus accumbens shell, as well as the IPN. To test whether functional DAergic neurotransmission exists in the IPN, we expressed the genetically encoded DA sensor, dLight 1.2, in the IPN of C57BL/6J mice and measured IPN DA signals <i>in vivo</i> during social and anxiety-like behavior using fiber photometry. We observed an increase in IPN DA signal during social investigation of a novel but not familiar conspecific and during exploration of the anxiogenic open arms of the elevated plus maze. Together, these data confirm VTA DAergic neuron projections to the IPN and implicate this circuit in encoding motivated exploration.",

Although gross motor defects have been extensively characterized in multiple HD mouse models using tasks such as rotarod and beam walking, less is known about forelimb deficits. We develop a high-throughput alternating reward/nonreward water-reaching task and training protocol conducted daily over approximately two months to simultaneously monitor forelimb impairment and mesoscale cortical changes in GCaMP activity, comparing female zQ175 (HD) and wild-type (WT) littermate mice, starting at ∼5.5 months. Behavioral analysis of the water-reaching task reveals that HD mice, despite learning the water-reaching task as proficiently as wild-type mice, take longer to learn the alternating event sequence as evident by impulsive (noncued) reaches and initially display reduced cortical activity associated with successful reaches. At this age gross motor defects determined by tapered beam assessment were not apparent. Although wild-type mice displayed no significant changes in cortical activity and reaching trajectory throughout the testing period, HD mice exhibited an increase in cortical activity, especially in the secondary motor and retrosplenial cortices, over time, as well as longer and more variable reaching trajectories by approximately seven months. HD mice also experienced a progressive reduction in successful performance. Tapered beam and rotarod tests as well as reduced DARPP-32 expression (striatal medium spiny neuron marker) after water-reaching assessment confirmed HD pathology. The water-reaching task can be used to inform on a daily basis, HD and other movement disorder onset and manifestation, therapeutic intervention windows, and test drug efficacy.",

The traditional culture (TC) and the rapid viability polymerase chain reaction (RV-PCR) methods were evaluated for their compatibility for maritime environmental surface and grab sample analysis to detect spores of Bacillus thuringiensis subspecies kurstaki (Btk), a surrogate for Bacillus anthracis. The representative samples collected from a USCG installation included surfaces, such as aluminum on boats, nonskid tread on decks of watercraft, computer touchscreens, and concrete piers, and grab samples of boat washdown water, soil, vegetation, and gravel from surrounding areas. Replicate samples were spiked with Btk spores at two to three tenfold increasing levels and analyzed. Out of a total of 150 samples collected and analyzed, the TC method gave 10 false-positive and 19 false-negative results, while the RV-PCR method-based analysis resulted in 0 false-positive and 26 false-negative results. An abundance of microbial background and particulates in some samples interfered with true results, while both methods gave similar results for samples with low microbial background and particulates.

We aimed to systemically evaluate the efficacy and investigate the mechanisms of SMI in modulating electrophysiology and calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) signaling using a microelectrode array (MEA) and a genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator, GCaMP6s, respectively, in human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs). A MEA system was employed to record field potentials (FPs) in hiPSC-CMs. The QT interval is corrected by the RR interval, the reciprocal of the beating rate. GCaMP6s was used to measure Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in hiPSC-CMs. Meanwhile, the transcriptome changes in hiPSC-CMs treated with 2% SMI were examined using RNAseq. In addition, the ingredients of SMI were investigated using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). It was found that 0.5%, 1%, and 2% (v/v) SMIs could increase corrected QT (QTc) but did not change other FP parameters. GCaMP6s was successfully applied to measure the chronic function of SMI. The full width at half maximum (FWHM), rise time, and decay time significantly decreased after treatment with SMI for 1 h and 24 h, whereas an increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient frequency was observed.

Viruses have evolved various strategies to manipulate mitophagy to escape host immune responses and promote virus replication. In this study, the nucleoprotein (NP) of H1N1 virus (PR8 strain) was identified as a regulator of mitophagy. We revealed that NP-mediated mitophagy leads to the degradation of the mitochondria-anchored protein MAVS, thereby blocking MAVS-mediated antiviral signaling and promoting virus replication. The NP-mediated mitophagy is dependent on the interaction of NP with MAVS and the cargo receptor TOLLIP. Moreover, Y313 of NP is a key residue for the MAVS-NP interaction and NP-mediated mitophagy. The NP<sup>Y313F</sup> mutation significantly attenuates the virus-induced mitophagy and the virus replication <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>.

Terrestrially, a baseline understanding of the gene fitness response for any plant growth-promoting microbe when in a tripartite relationship with host and pathogen is currently unknown and is important to characterize before closed-environment spaceflight implementation. To that end, this study evaluated the behavior of an ISS plant habitat isolate of <i>Burkholderia contaminans</i> as tomato seeds transitioned to seedlings and assessed gene fitness during challenge with <i>Fusarium oxysporum</i> f. sp. <i>lycopersici</i> (FOL), the causal agent of Fusarium wilt. Using a seed film delivery method vetted for spaceflight, <i>B. contaminans</i> was applied to <i>Solanum lycopersicum</i> cv. Red Robin seeds. Green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged <i>B. contaminans</i> was primarily found to localize at the shoot-root junction and was detected on shoots. Upon FOL challenge, <i>B. contaminans</i> population levels remained stable, and despite harboring antifungal and plant growth-promoting capacity, these properties were not conferred in response to FOL in the tissue culture environment. To probe mechanisms underlying the bacterial-fungal interaction between <i>B. contaminans</i> and FOL in the tomato root zone, a genome-wide transposon mutant library was developed for the <i>B. contaminans</i> isolate. Transposon sequencing (Tn-Seq) analysis revealed that the type II secretion system (T2SS) was critical for root zone establishment, whereas a Nudix hydrolase was specifically important for responding to FOL infection and provided further confirmation that antifungal and siderophore-producing gene clusters were not.IMPORTANCEThis study is the first to evaluate the genetic fitness of a <i>Burkholderia contaminans</i> International Space Station (ISS) isolate in the plant root zone in association with the obligate pathogen <i>Fusarium oxysporum</i> f. sp. <i>lycopersici</i> (FOL).

The response of <i>B. contaminans</i> in the host root zone when in the presence of the pathogen suggests the microbe is primed to counter stress, which may further confer an advantage in the spaceflight environment.",

Additionally, swine, which frequently interact with humans, may facilitate virus evolution, posing a risk to public health security. Consequently, there is a pressing need to develop safe, effective, and rapid vaccine platforms, with vector vaccine being a viable option. In this study, we utilized the enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) as an exogenous reporter to investigate the intergenic regions of the PIV5-JS17 strain for expressing exogenous proteins. These regions included N-P, P-M, M-F, F-SH, SH-HN, and HN-L. Our findings revealed that exogenous gene expression varied at different positions, with the expression cassette containing the non-coding sequence within the P-M intergenic region achieving the highest eGFP fluorescence intensity. Then, we successfully established a porcine infection model through oral administration of the recombinant virus, identified the target organs infected, and verified the safety of the viral vector in swine. Furthermore, using porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV)-S protein as a model antigen, it was demonstrated that the recombinant virus triggered a robust humoral and cellular immune responses. In conclusion, we have developed a novel oral gene delivery system for swine, providing insights and guidance for the design of vector vaccines based on the newly discovered porcine PIV5, the selection of appropriate exogenous gene insertion sites, and vaccine delivery strategies.IMPORTANCEThe research presented in this paper hinges on the fortunate isolation of the PIV5-JS17 strain from the intestines of pigs.

Puromycin-resistant clonal cells were isolated, and AAVS1 integration was confirmed via PCR and sequencing of the PCR products. The labeled cells are proliferative and can give rise to extravillous cytotrophoblast cells (EVT) and the syncytiotrophoblast (ST).

The current first-line systemic treatment for metastatic bladder cancer (mBC) is chemoimmunotherapy or immunotherapy with pembrolizumab plus enfortumab vedotin (EV). However, most mBC patients treated with chemoimmunotherapy or pembrolizumab/EV do not respond or eventually relapse, highlighting the critical need for robust immunocompetent animal models to elucidate the mechanisms of primary and acquired resistance. We previously generated a syngeneic murine cell line CMV-TRP (triple knockout of Trp53, Rb1, Pten) via ex vivo transduction with adenovirus (Ad5CMVCre). To establish an mBC model, the TKO cells were effectively labeled with a lentiviral luciferase and GFP double-expressing reporter and injected into tail veins of C57 BL/6J mice. Tail vein injection of TKO cells reliably established distant metastases with lung and bone lesions. In immunotherapy experiments, mice injected with TKO-labeled cell lines were randomly treated with an anti-PD-1 or control IgG2a antibody. All mice developed lung and/or bone (hind limb or sacrum) metastases. There was no difference in tumor bioluminescence between the control group and anti-PD-1 group (median proton/second 6.94 × 10<sup>8</sup> vs. 4.32 × 10<sup>8</sup>, p = 0.85). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed no difference in median survival between the control group and anti-PD-1 group (19 days vs. 20 days, p = 0.47). Histology and immunohistochemical profile of lung and bone metastases revealed high-grade basal-like urothelial carcinoma, closely resembling the profile observed in subcutaneous tumor. No significant changes in immune cell infiltrations (CD4<sup>+</sup>, CD8<sup>+</sup>, or F4/80<sup>+</sup>) between groups may explain anti-PD-1 immunotherapy resistance.

They are known as zombie-ant fungi because they manipulate the behaviour of ants, since infected ants are forced to move to specific sites in the forest, with optimal environmental conditions for the development of the fungus sporocarp or sporome and the release of the spores. Once there, the ants grab to the substrate with their mandibles, die, and their body becomes a source of nutrients for the fungus. Most of the species of the <i>O. unilateralis</i> complex have been described from the Neotropics and the East and Southeast Asia. However, it is likely that there are still many unknown species due to the diversity of their hosts and different specific associations.

We found the following host associations: one fungus - one ant, two fungi - one ant, and one fungus - two ants. Furthermore, we confirmed the host species of the ant genera <i>Camponotus</i> and <i>Colobopsis</i> (<i>Formicinae</i>) based on morphological characters and <i>COI</i> sequences, but we also found two species of <i>Cephalotes</i> (<i>Myrmicinae</i>) susceptible to fungal attack, challenging the paradigm that the <i>O. unilateralis</i> complex is a specific parasite of <i>Camponotini</i> (<i>Formicinae</i>) ants.
